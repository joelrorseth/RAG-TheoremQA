Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\).

Out of the 107 entrants, how many ways are there to choose 4 winners? All winners receive the same prize.\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.1, where **order does not matter** and **repeats are not allowed**. We can solve problems of this type with the binomial coefficient formula from Section 1.2.3.\n**Theorem 3.4.1**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of subsets of size \\(k\\) in a set of size \\(n\\) is_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\\]\n_More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: We already proved this in Lemma 1.2.6. Here we repeat the proof from Method 1, using the vocabulary of sets. By Theorem 3.3.9, the number of _ordered_ subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). However, that counts each unordered subset \\(k!\\) times, since \\(k!\\) is the number of permutations of \\(k\\) objects (Theorem 3.3.4).

To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\).

There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Theorem 4.6.3**.: _The number of ordered set partitions of an \\(n\\)-element set \\(S\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) is the multinomial coefficient_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdots k_{m}!}.\\]\nProof.: We count the number of ordered set partitions of a set \\(S\\) of size \\(n\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) as follows. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\). Out of the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements, there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{(n-k_{1})!}{k_{2}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2})}\\) ways to choose the next block \\(B_{2}\\). If \\(m\\geq 3\\), there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}!}=\\frac{(n-k_{1}-k_{2})!}{k_{3}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2}-k_ {3})!}\\) ways to choose the third block \\(B_{3}\\), and so on. Multiplying these together, all the factorials cancel except for \\(n!\\) in the numerator and the terms \\(k_{1}!,\\ldots,k_{m}!\\) in the denominator. The result follows.\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\). The number of ways we can do this is\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n\n\n",

For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nSolution.Both sides count the number of \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\)-strings of length \\(n\\), the right hand side first partitioning them according to positions in the string which are not \\(2\\). (For instance, if \\(6\\) of the positions are not \\(2\\), we must first choose those \\(6\\) positions in \\(C(n,6)\\) ways and then there are \\(2^{6}\\) ways to fill in those six positions by choosing either a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\) for each position.)\n**Example 2.20**.: Explain why, for each non-negative integer \\(n\\),\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n}=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{ n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nSolution.Both sides count the number of bit strings of length \\(2n\\) with half the bits being \\(0^{\\prime}\\)s, with the right side first partitioning them according to the number of \\(1^{\\prime}\\)s occurring in the first \\(n\\) positions of the string. Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\dots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1.\\]\nBy convention, we set \\(0!=1\\). As an example, \\(7!=7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=5040\\). Now for integers \\(m,n\\) with \\(m\\geq n\\geq 0\\) define \\(P(m,n)\\) by\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)\\cdots(m-n+1).\\]\nFor example, \\(P(9,3)=9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7=504\\) and \\(P(8,4)=8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5=1680\\). Also, a computer algebra system will quickly report that\n\\[P(68,23)=20732231223375515741894286164203929600000.\\]\n**Proposition 2.6**.: _If \\(X\\) is an \\(m\\)-element set and \\(n\\) is a positive integer with \\(m\\geq n\\), then the number of \\(X\\)-strings of length \\(n\\) that are permutations is \\(P(m,n)\\)._\nProof.: The proposition is true since when constructing a permutation \\(s=x_{1}x_{2},\\dots x_{n}\\) from an \\(m\\)-element set, we see that there are \\(m\\) choices for \\(x_{1}\\). After fixing \\(x_{1}\\), we have that for \\(x_{2}\\), there are \\(m-1\\) choices, as we can use any element of \\(X-\\{x_{1}\\}\\). For \\(x_{3}\\), there are \\(m-2\\) choices, since we can use any element in \\(X-\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}\\). For \\(x_{n}\\), there are \\(m-n+1\\) choices, because we can use any element of \\(X\\) except \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots x_{n-1}\\). Noting that\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)(m-2)\\dots(m-n+1),\\]\nour proof is complete.\nNote that the answer we arrived at in Example 2.5 is simply \\(P(26,6)\\) as we would expect in light of Proposition 2.6.\n**Example 2.7**.: It's time to elect a slate of four class officers (President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer) from the pool of 80 students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. If any interested student could be elected to any position (Alice contends this is a big \"if\" since Bob is running), how many different slates of officers can be elected?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks.

More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\n\n",

Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWhen \\(y\\) was presented, there was at that moment in time a chain \\(C^{\\prime}\\) of \\(r\\) points having \\(y\\) as its least element. Also, there was a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points having \\(y\\) as its greatest element.\nNow suppose that \\(y>x\\) in \\(P\\). Then we can add \\(x\\) to \\(C^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(r+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its least element. This would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned in \\(A(r,s)\\). Similarly, if \\(y<x\\) in \\(P\\), then we may add \\(x\\) to \\(D^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(s+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its greatest element. Again, this would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned to \\(A(r,s)\\).\nSo Assigner has indeed devised a good strategy for partitioning \\(P\\) into antichains, but how many antichains has she used? This is just asking how many ordered pairs \\((i,j)\\) of positive integers are there subject to the restriction that \\(i+j-1\\leq h\\). And we learned how to solve this kind of question in Chapter 2. The answer of course is \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\).\nThe strategy for Assigner is so simple and natural, it might be the case that a more complex strategy would yield a more efficient partitioning. Not so.\n**Theorem 16.5** (Szemeredi).: _For every \\(h\\geq 1\\), there is a strategy \\(S_{h}\\) for builder that will enable him to build a poset \\(P\\) of height \\(h\\) so that assigner is forced to (1) use at least \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\) antichains in partitioning \\(P\\), and (2) use at least \\(h\\) different antichains on the set of maximal elements._\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSince we're only after the cycle index of \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), we don't need to find all 24 permutations in the pair group. However, we do need to know the types of those permutations in terms of cycle lengths so we can associate the appropriate monomials. For the three examples we've considered, the cycle structure of the permutation in the pair group doesn't depend on the original permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) other than for _its_ cycle structure. Any permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a 2-cycle and two 1-cycles will correspond to a permutation with two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\). A permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) with one 3-cycle and one 1-cycle will correspond to a permutation with two 3-cycles in the pair group. By considering an example of a permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a single 4-cycle, we find that the corresponding permutation in the pair group has a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. Finally, a permutation of \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of two 2-cycles corresponds to a permutation in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\) having two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles. (Exercise 15.6.8 asks you to verify these claims using specific permutations.)\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\n\n\n",

To do this, we define a _set partition_, which is a a helpful way to organize sets.\n**Definition 2.9.1**.: Let \\(A\\) be a finite set. A non-empty subset \\(B\\) of \\(A\\) is called a **block**. A **set partition** of a finite set \\(A\\) is a set of blocks \\(\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) of \\(A\\) such that:\n1. the blocks are disjoint, that is, \\(B_{i}\\cap B_{j}=\\emptyset\\) for all \\(i\\neq j\\); and\n2. the union of the blocks is \\(A\\), that is \\(B_{1}\\cup B_{2}\\cup\\cdots\\cup B_{k}=A\\).\n**Example 2.9.2**.: The following is a set partition of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}\\):\n\\[\\{\\{1,3,4\\},\\{2,6\\},\\{5,7\\}\\}.\\]\nThe division principle arises when we split a set into blocks of equal sizes. It can be stated as follows.\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nwhere the sum has \\(a\\) copies of \\(b\\). By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNevertheless, we can consider the general case. We are given a set \\(S\\) of \\(n\\) integers and a number \\(x\\). Then we are asked whether there are three integers in \\(S\\) whose sum is \\(x\\). The algorithm we have described would have running time proportional to \\(n^{3}\\), where the constant of proportionality depends on the time it takes to test a triple of numbers to see if there sum is \\(x\\). Of course, this depends in turn on just how large the integer \\(x\\) and the integers in \\(S\\) can be.\nThe third of the three problems is different. First, it seems to be much harder. There are \\(2^{n-1}\\) complementary pairs of subsets of a set of size \\(n\\), and one of these involves the empty set and the entire set. But that leaves \\(2^{n-1}-1\\) pairs to test. Each of these tests is not all that tough. A netbook can easily report whether a two subsets have the same sum, even when the two sets form a partition of a set of size \\(10,000\\), but there are approximately \\(10^{3000}\\) partitions to test and no piece of hardware on the planet will touch that assignment. And if we go up to a set of size \\(1,000,000\\), then the combined computing power of all the machines on earth won't get the job done.\n\n\n",

In how many ways can we choose 4 balls, if at least 2 are red?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 2.7 Multinomial Coefficients\nLet \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different different bouquets of 10 balloons are there that contain at least one balloon of each color? In this case, \\(m=10\\) and \\(n=6\\). Hence the number of ways is \\(\\binom{10-1}{6-1}=\\binom{9}{5}\\).\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Proposition 5.4.12**.: _Suppose \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer such that \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). Then the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\) (with repeats allowed) is_\n\\[\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\\]\nProof.: We first find a set \\(A\\) whose size is the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\). To do this, let \\(A\\) be the set of cups filled with \\(k\\) M&M's, where there are \\(n\\) different possible colors of M&M's.\nNext, we find a set \\(B\\) whose size is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). Let \\(B\\) be the set of binary sequences consisting of \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-1\\) ones. Such a sequence has \\(n+k-1\\) entries total and is determined by choosing which \\(k\\) positions contain the \\(0\\)'s. So the size of \\(B\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\).\nWe need to find a bijective map between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Fix an ordering of colors, for example, rainbow order with brown at the end. An element of the set \\(A\\) is a cup of \\(k\\) colored M&M's. Given such a cup, spill the M&M's onto a plate and sort them by color, in a row. Now there are \\(k\\) M&M's separated into \\(n\\) sections (some of which may be empty). Put a toothpick between each section, using \\(n-1\\) toothpicks total. Finally, put on color-filter goggles so that all the M&M's look grey. What we see is a row of \\(k\\) grey M&M's and \\(n-1\\) toothpicks. Write a sequence of \\(0\\)'s and \\(1\\)'s by writing a \\(0\\) for each grey M&M and writing a \\(1\\) for each toothpick. This results in a sequence of \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-1\\) ones, which is an element of the set \\(B\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 5.6.12**.: Consider the complete graph \\(K_{6}\\) with 6 vertices (every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge). If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n\n\n",

We now consider the vertices adjacent to this first one. Since these vertices are adjacent to the first labeled vertex, the color used for the first labeled vertex is not an option. So there are \\(k-1\\) choices for the color of any vertex adjacent to the first labeled vertex. We continue in this fashion. We can color the starting vertex with any of the \\(k\\) colors. Then, each branch can be colored with any of the \\((k-1)\\) colors remaining. The branches off those vertices are not connected to the starting vertex anymore, so while one color is removed, the color of the starting vertex is added back.

In its pair, \\(A_{1}\\) is called the _outer twin_ and \\(A_{2}\\) is called the _inner twin_ (and similarly for all other twin pairs).\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction this graph were 3-colorable. Without loss of generality let the central vertex be Red. So all 5 inner vertices are Blue or Green. A way of coloring the vertices that agrees with this choice is shown below (but naturally is not a 3-coloring - we will just pretend that it is a valid coloring as an illustration).\nWe will show that, if this coloring is a valid 3-coloring, then we can use it to produce a valid 2-coloring of the outer 5-cycle (but _not_ of the entire graph) as follows: if any outer twin is colored Red, replace Red with the color of its inner twin (Blue or Green). Then in this coloring of the outer cycle with Blue and Green, if an outer twin \\(v\\) is changed from Red to Blue (for example), then both of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins must be Green. Indeed, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been Blue since they are each connected to \\(v\\)'s inner twin which is Blue.

First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique.

The reason is that if someone shook \\(0\\) hands, then no one shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests; if someone shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests, then no one shook \\(0\\) hands. Hence we are assigning \\(n\\) people to \\(n-1\\) boxes (labeled either by \\(0\\) through \\(n-2\\) or by \\(1\\) through \\(n-1\\)). By the pigeonhole principle, two people must be assigned to the same box, and hence shook the same number of hands.\n**Proposition 5.6.7**.: _(Pigeonhole principle Version 2) Suppose \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. If we place more than \\(kn\\) objects into \\(n\\) boxes, then some box contains at least \\(k+1\\) objects_\n**Remark 5.6.8**.: To obtain Version 1 from Version 2, substitute the value \\(k=1\\).\nProof.: If each box contained at most \\(k\\) objects, then the total number of objects would be at most \\(kn\\), which is a contradiction.\nTo solve the problem about Colorado at the beginning of the section, we use Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle as follows\n_Answer._ Label the boxes by the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(n=1,000,000\\). People are assigned to the \\(i\\)th box if they have exactly \\(i\\) hairs on their heads. Let \\(k=5\\). Since \\(5,612,000>5,000,000=(5)\\cdot(1,000,000)=k\\cdot n\\), there is a box with at least \\(6=k+1\\) people by the pigeonhole principle (Version 2). These \\(6\\) people all have the same number of hairs on their heads.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different different bouquets of 10 balloons are there that contain at least one balloon of each color? In this case, \\(m=10\\) and \\(n=6\\). Hence the number of ways is \\(\\binom{10-1}{6-1}=\\binom{9}{5}\\).\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\n\n",

How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car.

When they arrive at the ice cream shop, they need to wait in line. Student \\(a\\) argues they should wait in alphabetical order, but student \\(g\\) has a strong opposition to this ordering. This prompts the question: How many different ways are there for them to wait in an ordered line?\nTo solve this kind of problem, we need the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.1**.: A **permutation** of \\(n\\) objects is an ordering or arrangement of all \\(n\\) of them.\nA permutation can be expressed as a sequence or string.\n**Example 3.3.2**.: For example, the set \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\) has 6 permutations:\n\\[abc\\quad acb\\quad bac\\quad cab\\quad cba\\]\n**Example 3.3.3**.: To write down a permutation of the set \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}\\), we use sequence notation rather than string notation, since 10 has two digits. One possible permutation is:\n\\[(3,6,7,2,1,10,4,5,9,8).\\]\nRecall that \\(n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\), and we pronounce the symbol \\(n!\\) as \"\\(n\\) factorial\".\n**Theorem 3.3.4**.: _The number of permutations of \\(n\\) objects is \\(n!\\)._\nProof.: By Theorem 3.2.9, there are \\(n\\) choices for the first object, then \\(n-1\\) choices for the second object, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on until there is only one 1 choice remaining for the \\(n\\)th object.

Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n2.

Use induction on \\(m\\) to prove statement 1, where the inductive hypothesis is that \\((x+y)^{2^{m-1}}\\equiv x^{2^{m-1}}+y^{2^{m-1}}\\bmod 2\\). For the inductive step, square both sides of the equation.\n**Question 5.8.7**.: (A bijective/combinatorial proof.) Prove Proposition 5.8.4 with this method.\n1. Explain why \\(\\binom{2^{m}}{k}\\) is the number of ways to make a subset of \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\). (For example, if \\(m=2\\) and \\(k=2\\), then the number of subsets listed in (2.1) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}=6\\).)\n2. Because of part (1), we want to show the number of subsets of \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) is even. Use part (3) of the previous problem to explain why this is true if \\(k\\) is odd.\n3. To handle the case when \\(k\\) is even, we will use induction on \\(m\\); the inductive hypothesis is that the statement is true for \\(m-1\\), in other words, that \\(\\binom{2^{m-1}}{k}\\) is even for all \\(0<k<2^{m-1}\\). Write down what the base case is and verify that it is true.\n4. If \\(T\\) is a subset, recall the definition of the complement subset \\(T^{c}\\) from Problem 11 in Section 2.10. For the inductive step, we want to show that \\(\\binom{2^{m}}{k}\\) is even for all \\(0<k<2^{m}\\). Suppose \\(k\\) is even (because we are already done with the case that \\(k\\) is odd). Show that the number of subsets \\(T\\) such that \\(T\\neq T^{c}\\) is even. Show that the number of subsets \\(T\\) such that \\(T=T^{c}\\) is even using the inductive hypothesis and part (4) of the previous problem.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nProof of Proposition 5.4.9 for \\(n\\) even (and odd).: Since \\(\\Omega\\) is nonempty, pick a distinguished element, say \\(1\\in\\Omega\\). Group the subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) into pairs where the two subsets in each pair differ only in whether they contain \\(1\\) or not. Every subset is in exactly one pair. Each pair contains one subset of even size and one subset of odd size. So the number of subsets of odd size and of even size is the same.\nAs another example of a bijective proof, we prove the \"sticks and stones\" theorem (Theorem 3.5.6) again here, using \"M&M's and toothpicks\" instead. The logic we used in Section 3.5 to prove this result is really a bijection in disguise.\n**Proposition 5.4.12**.: _Suppose \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer such that \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). Then the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\) (with repeats allowed) is_\n\\[\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\\]\nProof.: We first find a set \\(A\\) whose size is the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\). To do this, let \\(A\\) be the set of cups filled with \\(k\\) M&M's, where there are \\(n\\) different possible colors of M&M's.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\).

If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession.

For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Remark 3.3.5**.: If there are 0 objects, then there is only one way to arrange them (do nothing). This can be thought of as the \"empty sequence\" or \"empty string\". Therefore, we set \\(0!=1\\).\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nMultinomial coefficients and anagrams\nWe start with one application of multinomial coefficients, which is to count anagrams.\n**Definition 4.5.1**.: An **anagram** is a rearrangement of the letters in a word.\nAn anagram is different from a permutation, because some letters can occur in a word multiple times.\n**Example 4.5.2**.: For example, let's consider the permutations of the word ZOO. Typically, the number of permutations of three letters is \\(3!=6\\). However, two of the letters in ZOO are the same. After we label the two \\(O\\)'s as \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), the six permutations are:\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}&&\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_ {1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathbb{Z}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathbb{Z} .\\end{array}\\]\nHowever, the number of anagrams is half of 6, since each anagram of ZOO appears 2 times on this list. Recognizing that each row gives a different anagram, we can list the \\(6/2=3\\) anagrams of the word ZOO. They are: ZOO, OZO, and OOZ.\n**Example 4.5.3**.: The word SASSY has 20 anagrams. Typically, the number of permutations of five letters is \\(5!=120\\). In the list of these permutations, each anagram is written \\(3!=6\\) times, corresponding to the rearrangement of the three S's. So the number of anagrams is \\(5!/3!=20\\).\n**Example 4.5.4**.: How many anagrams are there for FORTCOLLINS? One approach is to say that there are 11 letters in total, but two of these are L and two of these are O. So in the list of 11! permutations of the letters, each word is written four times (the three extra times correspond to switching the locations of the two L's, switching the locations of the two O's, and switching both the two L's and the two O's). Hence the total number of anagrams is \\(11!/4\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nEach bag can be written using six stones and four sticks. There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n\n\n",

Group the subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) into pairs where the two subsets in each pair differ only in whether they contain \\(1\\) or not. Every subset is in exactly one pair. Each pair contains one subset of even size and one subset of odd size.

Let \\(A\\) be the set of multiples of \\(2\\) in \\(S\\). Let \\(B\\) be the set of multiples of \\(3\\) in \\(S\\). Let \\(C\\) be the set of multiples of \\(5\\) in \\(S\\). Then\n\\[|A|=105,\\ |B|=70,\\text{ and }|C|=42.\\]\nIt is useful that the numbers \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) and \\(5\\) are all relatively prime.

The intersection \\(A\\cap B\\) is the set of multiples of 21.\nWe want to count the elements that are not in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). This is the complement of \\(A\\cup B\\) in \\(S\\). The number of these is\n\\[|S-(A\\cup B)|=210-|A\\cup B|.\\]\nThere are 70 multiples of 3 in \\(S\\) so \\(|A|=70\\). There are 30 multiples of 7 in \\(S\\) so \\(|B|=30\\). But if we subtract both 70 and 30 from 210, we've removed each multiple of 21 twice, since it is divisible by both 3 and 7.

Typically, the number of permutations of three letters is \\(3!=6\\). However, two of the letters in ZOO are the same. After we label the two \\(O\\)'s as \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), the six permutations are:\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}&&\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_ {1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathbb{Z}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathbb{Z} .\\end{array}\\]\nHowever, the number of anagrams is half of 6, since each anagram of ZOO appears 2 times on this list. Recognizing that each row gives a different anagram, we can list the \\(6/2=3\\) anagrams of the word ZOO. They are: ZOO, OZO, and OOZ.\n**Example 4.5.3**.: The word SASSY has 20 anagrams. Typically, the number of permutations of five letters is \\(5!=120\\). In the list of these permutations, each anagram is written \\(3!=6\\) times, corresponding to the rearrangement of the three S's. So the number of anagrams is \\(5!/3!=20\\).\n**Example 4.5.4**.: How many anagrams are there for FORTCOLLINS? One approach is to say that there are 11 letters in total, but two of these are L and two of these are O. So in the list of 11! permutations of the letters, each word is written four times (the three extra times correspond to switching the locations of the two L's, switching the locations of the two O's, and switching both the two L's and the two O's). Hence the total number of anagrams is \\(11!/4\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n_Answer._ This is the number of ordered subsets of size \\(47\\) from a set of size \\(50\\).

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion.

The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings.

Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 2.9 Exercises\n**1.** The Hawaiian alphabet consists of 12 letters.

We can get a feel for why this is the case by focusing just on the digit part of the string here. We can think about the digits portion as being four blanks that need to be filled. The first blank has \\(9\\) options (the digits \\(1\\) through \\(9\\)). If we focus on just the digit strings beginning with \\(1\\), one perspective is that they range from \\(1000\\) to \\(1999\\), so there are \\(1000\\) of them. However, we could also think about there being \\(10\\) options for the second spot, \\(10\\) options for the third spot, and \\(10\\) options for the fourth. Multiplying \\(10\\times 10\\times 10\\) gives \\(1000\\). Since our analysis of filling the remaining digit blanks didn't depend on our choice of a \\(1\\) for the first position, we see that each of the \\(9\\) choices of initial digit gives \\(1\\,000\\) strings, for a total of \\(9\\,000=9\\times 10^{3}\\).\nIn the case that \\(X=\\{0,1\\}\\), an \\(X\\)-string is called a \\(0\\)-\\(1\\) string (also a **binary string** or **bit string**.). When \\(X=\\{0,1,2\\}\\), an \\(X\\)-string is also called a **ternary** string.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nBefore proceeding to an additional example, let's take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\nwhich there are no restrictions, a factor of \\(e^{7x}\\) is introduced. To account for an even number of \\(0\\)s, he uses \\((e^{x}+e^{-x})/2\\). For at least one \\(1\\), a factor of \\(e^{x}-1\\) is required. Finally, \\(1+x+x^{2}/2!+x^{3}/3!\\) accounts for the restriction of at most three \\(2\\)s. The exponential generating function for the number of \\(n\\)-digit passcodes is thus\n\\[e^{7x}\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}(e^{x}-1)\\left(1+x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3! }\\right).\\]\n\n\n",

Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nTo motivate the topic of this section, we consider another variant on the officer election problem from Example 2.7. Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of 80 students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the \"first\" seat on the executive council and her winning the \"fourth\" seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the 80 students without any regard to order. We'll return to this question after introducing our next concept.\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute \\(C(n,k)\\) in general.\n**Proposition 2.9**.: _If \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are integers with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\), then_\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Theorem 7.12**.: _For a positive integer \\(n\\), let \\(d_{n}\\) denote the number of derangements of \\([n]\\). Then_\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{d_{n}}{n!}=\\frac{1}{e}.\\]\n_Equivalently, the fraction of all permutations of \\([n]\\) that are derangements approaches \\(1/e\\) as \\(n\\) increases._\nProof.: It is easy to see that\n\\[\\frac{d_{n}}{n!} =\\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)!}{n!}\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\frac{(n-k)!}{n!}\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\\frac{1}{k!}.\\]\nRecall from Calculus that the Taylor series expansion of \\(e^{x}\\) is given by\n\\[e^{x}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^{k}}{k!},\\]\nand thus the result then follows by substituting \\(x=-1\\).\nUsually we're not as interested in \\(d_{n}\\) itself as we are in enumerating permutations with certain restrictions, as the following example illustrates.\n**Example 7.13**.: Consider the Hat Check problem, but suppose instead of wanting no man to leave with his own hat, we are interested in the number of ways to distribute the \\(100\\) hats so that precisely \\(40\\) of the men leave with their own hats.\nIf \\(40\\) men leave with their own hats, then there are \\(60\\) men who do not receive their own hats. There are \\(C(100,60)\\) ways to choose the \\(60\\) men who will not receive their own hats and \\(d_{60}\\) ways to distribute those hats so that no man receives his own. There's only one way to distribute the \\(40\\) hats to the men who must receive their own hats, meaning that there are\n\\[\\binom{100}{60}d_{60}= 42078873492228172128327462833913452107738151595140722182899444\\] \\[67852500232068048628965153767728913178940196920\\]\nsuch ways to return the hats.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nour proof is complete.\nNote that the answer we arrived at in Example 2.5 is simply \\(P(26,6)\\) as we would expect in light of Proposition 2.6.\n**Example 2.7**.: It's time to elect a slate of four class officers (President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer) from the pool of 80 students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. If any interested student could be elected to any position (Alice contends this is a big \"if\" since Bob is running), how many different slates of officers can be elected?\nSolution.To count possible officer slates, work from a set \\(X\\) containing the names of the 80 interested students (yes, even poor Bob). A permutation of length four chosen from \\(X\\) is then a slate of officers by considering the first name in the permutation as the President, the second as the Vice President, the third as the Secretary, and the fourth as the Treasurer. Thus, the number of officer slates is \\(P(80,4)=37957920\\).\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\nconsist of two 2-cycles, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose two elements for the first 2-cycle. The other two are then put in the second 2-cycle. However, this counts each permutation twice, once for when the first 2-cycle is the chosen pair and once for when it is the \"other two.\" Thus, there are 3 permutations consisting of two 2-cycles. Finally, only \\(\\iota\\) consists of four 1-cycles.\n\n\n",

Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\).

How many such sequences are there?\n3. Suppose Amanda decides to give each child at least one dollar. How does this change the answers to the first two questions?\n4. Now suppose that Amanda has ten books, in fact the top 10 books from the New York Times best-seller list, and decides to give them to her children. How many ways can she do this? Again, we note that there is a hidden assumption--the ten books are all different.\n5. Suppose the ten books are labeled \\(B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{10}\\). The sets of books given to the three children are pairwise disjoint and their union is \\(\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{10}\\}\\). How many different sets of the form \\(\\{S_{1},S_{2},S_{3}\\}\\) where \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\) and \\(S_{3}\\) are pairwise disjoint and \\(S_{1}\\cup S_{2}\\cup S_{3}=\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{10}\\}\\)?\n6. Suppose Amanda decides to give each child at least one book. How does this change the answers to the preceding two questions?\n7. How would we possibly answer these kinds of questions if ten was really ten thousand (OK, we're not talking about children any more!) and three was three thousand? Could you write the answer on a single page in a book?\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nwhere the sum has \\(a\\) copies of \\(b\\). By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNevertheless, we can consider the general case. We are given a set \\(S\\) of \\(n\\) integers and a number \\(x\\). Then we are asked whether there are three integers in \\(S\\) whose sum is \\(x\\). The algorithm we have described would have running time proportional to \\(n^{3}\\), where the constant of proportionality depends on the time it takes to test a triple of numbers to see if there sum is \\(x\\). Of course, this depends in turn on just how large the integer \\(x\\) and the integers in \\(S\\) can be.\nThe third of the three problems is different. First, it seems to be much harder. There are \\(2^{n-1}\\) complementary pairs of subsets of a set of size \\(n\\), and one of these involves the empty set and the entire set. But that leaves \\(2^{n-1}-1\\) pairs to test. Each of these tests is not all that tough. A netbook can easily report whether a two subsets have the same sum, even when the two sets form a partition of a set of size \\(10,000\\), but there are approximately \\(10^{3000}\\) partitions to test and no piece of hardware on the planet will touch that assignment. And if we go up to a set of size \\(1,000,000\\), then the combined computing power of all the machines on earth won't get the job done.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n16.

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 2.9 Exercises\n**1.** The Hawaiian alphabet consists of 12 letters.

He knows passwords are most secure if they contain letters, numbers, and symbols. However, he doesn't quite understand that this additional security is defeated if he specifies in which positions each character type appears. He decides that valid passwords for his system will begin with three letters (uppercase and lowercase both allowed), followed by two digits, followed by one of 10 symbols, followed by two uppercase letters, followed by a digit, followed by one of 10 symbols. How many different passwords are there for his website system? How does this compare to the total number of strings of length 10 made from the alphabet of all uppercase and lowercase English letters, decimal digits, and 10 symbols?\n**4.** How many ternary strings of length \\(2n\\) are there in which the zeroes appear only in odd-numbered positions?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[(X-\\{0\\})\\times X\\times X\\times X\\times Y\\times Z\\times Z\\times Z\\]\nso the number of different license plates is \\(9\\times 10^{3}\\times 1\\times 26^{3}=158\\,184\\,000\\), since the size of a product of sets is the product of the sets' sizes. We can get a feel for why this is the case by focusing just on the digit part of the string here. We can think about the digits portion as being four blanks that need to be filled. The first blank has \\(9\\) options (the digits \\(1\\) through \\(9\\)). If we focus on just the digit strings beginning with \\(1\\), one perspective is that they range from \\(1000\\) to \\(1999\\), so there are \\(1000\\) of them. However, we could also think about there being \\(10\\) options for the second spot, \\(10\\) options for the third spot, and \\(10\\) options for the fourth. Multiplying \\(10\\times 10\\times 10\\) gives \\(1000\\). Since our analysis of filling the remaining digit blanks didn't depend on our choice of a \\(1\\) for the first position, we see that each of the \\(9\\) choices of initial digit gives \\(1\\,000\\) strings, for a total of \\(9\\,000=9\\times 10^{3}\\).\nIn the case that \\(X=\\{0,1\\}\\), an \\(X\\)-string is called a \\(0\\)-\\(1\\) string (also a **binary string** or **bit string**.).

In either case, exactly every pair of vertices in \\(H\\) behaves in exactly the same boring way. So is boredom inevitable? The answer is yes--at least in a relative sense. As a starter, let's show that any graph on six (or more) vertices has a boring subgraph of size three.\n**Lemma 11.1**.: _Let \\(G\\) be any graph with six of more vertices. Then either \\(G\\) contains a complete subgraph of size \\(3\\) or an independent set of size \\(3\\)._\nProof.: Let \\(x\\) be any vertex in \\(G\\). Then split the remaining vertices into two sets \\(S_{1}\\) and\n\\(S_{2}\\) with \\(S_{1}\\) being the neighbors of \\(x\\) and \\(S_{2}\\) the non-neighbors. Since \\(G\\) has at least six vertices, we know that either \\(|S_{1}|\\geq 3\\) or \\(|S_{2}|\\geq 3\\). Suppose first that \\(|S_{1}|\\geq 3\\) and let \\(y_{1}\\), \\(y_{2}\\) and \\(y_{3}\\) be distinct vertices from \\(S_{1}\\). If \\(y_{i}y_{j}\\) is an edge in \\(G\\) for some distinct pair \\(i,j\\in\\{1,23\\}\\), then \\(\\{x,y_{i},y_{j}\\}\\) is a complete subgraph of size \\(3\\) in \\(G\\). On the other hand, if there are no edges among the vertices in \\(\\{y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\\}\\), then we have an independent set of size \\(3\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nProof.: Before proceeding with the details of the argument, let's pause to get the general idea behind the proof. We choose integers \\(n\\) and \\(s\\) with \\(n>s\\), and it will eventually be clear how large they need to be in terms of \\(g\\) and \\(t\\). We will then consider a random graph on vertex set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\), and just as before, for each \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) with \\(1\\leq i<j\\leq n\\), the probability that the pair \\(ij\\) is an edge is \\(p\\), but now \\(p\\) will depend on \\(n\\). Of course, the probability that any given pair is an edge is completely independent of all other pairs.\nOur first goal is to choose the values of \\(n\\), \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) so that with high probability, a random graph does not have an independent set of size \\(s\\). You might think as a second goal, we would try to get a random graph without small cycles. But this goal is too restrictive. Instead, we just try to get a graph in which there are relatively few small cycles. In fact, we want the number of small cycles to be less than \\(n/2\\). Then we will\nremove one vertex from each small cycles, resulting in a graph with at least \\(n/2\\) vertices, having no small cycles and no independent set of size \\(s\\). The chromatic number of this graph is at least \\(n/2s\\), so we will want to have the inequality \\(n>2st\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nReturning to the discussion at the start of this section, you might say that an induced subgraph \\(H\\) of a graph \\(G\\) is \"boring\" if it is either a complete subgraph or an independent set.

On the other hand, if there are no edges among the vertices in \\(\\{y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\\}\\), then we have an independent set of size \\(3\\).\nThe argument when \\(|S_{2}|\\geq 3\\) is dual.\nWe note that the bound of six in the preceding lemma is sharp, as a cycle on five vertices does not contain either a complete set of size \\(3\\) nor an independent set of size \\(3\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n#### 5.4.2 Cliques and Chromatic Number\nA **clique** in a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}=(V,E)\\) is a set \\(K\\subseteq V\\) such that the subgraph induced by \\(K\\) is isomorphic to the complete graph \\(\\mathbf{K}_{|K|}\\). Equivalently, we can say that every pair of vertices in \\(K\\) are adjacent. The **maximum clique size** or **clique number** of a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), denoted \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\) , is the largest \\(t\\) for which there exists a clique \\(K\\) with \\(|K|=t\\). For example, the graph in Figure 5.14 has clique number \\(4\\) while the graph in Figure 5.19 has maximum clique size \\(2\\).\nFor every graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), it is obvious that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})\\geq\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\). On the other hand, the inequality may be far from tight. Before proving showing how bad it can be, we need to introduce a more general version of the Pigeon Hole Principle. Consider a function \\(f\\colon X\\to Y\\) with \\(|X|=2|Y|+1\\). Since \\(|X|>|Y|\\), the Pigeon Hole Principle as stated in Proposition 4.1 only tells us that there are distinct \\(x,x^{\\prime}\\in X\\) with \\(f(x)=f(x^{\\prime})\\). However, we can say more here. Suppose that each element of \\(Y\\) has at most two elements of \\(X\\) mapped to it. Then adding up the number of elements of \\(X\\) based on how many are mapped to each element of \\(Y\\) would only allow \\(X\\) to have (at most) \\(2|Y|\\) elements. Thus, there must be \\(y\\in Y\\) so that there are three distinct elements \\(x,x^{\\prime},x^{\\prime\\prime}\\in X\\) with \\(f(x)=f(x^{\\prime})=f(x^{\\prime\\prime})=y\\).

What is the minimum number of instructors you need to hire?\nYou can solve this problem by building a graph with a vertex for each math class, and by adding an edge between two vertices if the corresponding classes overlap in time. The minimum number of colors needed to color this graph is the same as the minimum possible number of instructors you need to hire.\nSee Problem #4 in Section 12.7 for another example scheduling application.\n**Remark 12.4.2**.: Deciding if a graph with \\(n\\) vertices is 3-colorable in general takes running time \\(\\approx 2^{n/2}\\).

Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\).

There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\).

The number of ordered subsets of size \\(k\\) from a set with \\(n\\) elements is_\n\\[n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\] (3.1)\n_More generally, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: An ordered subset of size \\(k\\) is a sequence of length \\(k\\) chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) in which no two entries are equal. There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Lemma 2.6.10** (The subtraction principle for sets).: _If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are finite sets and \\(B\\subseteq A\\), then \\(|A-B|=|A|-|B|\\)._\n**Example 2.6.11**.: How many numbers in \\(A=\\{1,\\ldots,25\\}\\) are not a multiple of \\(5\\)?\nTo answer this, let \\(B=\\{5,10,15,20,25\\}\\).

If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)?

If we place more than \\(kn\\) objects into \\(n\\) boxes, then some box contains at least \\(k+1\\) objects_\n**Remark 5.6.8**.: To obtain Version 1 from Version 2, substitute the value \\(k=1\\).\nProof.: If each box contained at most \\(k\\) objects, then the total number of objects would be at most \\(kn\\), which is a contradiction.\nTo solve the problem about Colorado at the beginning of the section, we use Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle as follows\n_Answer._ Label the boxes by the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(n=1,000,000\\). People are assigned to the \\(i\\)th box if they have exactly \\(i\\) hairs on their heads. Let \\(k=5\\). Since \\(5,612,000>5,000,000=(5)\\cdot(1,000,000)=k\\cdot n\\), there is a box with at least \\(6=k+1\\) people by the pigeonhole principle (Version 2). These \\(6\\) people all have the same number of hairs on their heads.\n**Remark 5.6.9**.: For pigeonhole principle problems, our recommendation is to:\n* Identify \\(k+1\\), and hence \\(k\\).\n* Define your \\(n\\) boxes (such that if enough objects land in a single box, then you have accomplished the goal of the problem!)\n* Make sure that the number of objects is bigger than \\(k\\cdot n\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Example 3.5.14**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 nonnegative integers have sum equal to 9? Examples include \\((4,0,2,3)\\), \\((0,4,2,3)\\), and \\((0,0,0,9)\\). These are called _compositions_ of 9 of length 4.\nSuch a composition encodes a way to distribute \\(k=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people, where the first number on list indicates the number of pennies to person 1, the second is the number of pennies to person 2, and so on.\nTherefore there are \\(\\binom{4}{9}=\\binom{4+9-1}{9}=\\binom{12}{9}=220\\) compositions of 9 of length 4.\n**Corollary 3.5.15**.: _If \\(m\\geq n\\), the number of ways to distribute \\(m\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people, so that each person must receive at least one penny, is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\n**Example 3.5.16**.: The number of ways to distribute \\(m=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people so that each person gets at least one is \\(\\binom{9-1}{4-1}=\\binom{8}{3}=56\\).\n**Example 3.5.17**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 positive integers have sum equal to 9? Examples include \\((3,2,1,3)\\), \\((1,2,3,3)\\), \\((2,2,2,3)\\), but not \\((4,0,2,3)\\) as 0 is not positive.\nIn this case, by subtracting 1 from each of the elements of the list, it is the same as the number of compositions of 5 of length 4.

Let's label the boxes by the numbers \\(0\\) through \\(n-1\\) and put a person in box \\(i\\) if they shook hands with exactly \\(i\\) people. At first, it does not look like we can use the pigeonhole principle because there are \\(n\\) people and \\(n\\) boxes.\nHowever, there is one piece of information we did not use. Either box \\(0\\) or box \\(n-1\\) is empty. The reason is that if someone shook \\(0\\) hands, then no one shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests; if someone shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests, then no one shook \\(0\\) hands. Hence we are assigning \\(n\\) people to \\(n-1\\) boxes (labeled either by \\(0\\) through \\(n-2\\) or by \\(1\\) through \\(n-1\\)). By the pigeonhole principle, two people must be assigned to the same box, and hence shook the same number of hands.\n**Proposition 5.6.7**.: _(Pigeonhole principle Version 2) Suppose \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer.

Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n**Example 3.5.13**.: When \\(k=5\\) and \\(n=4\\), for the multiset \\(\\{A_{1},A_{1},A_{3},A_{4},A_{4}\\}\\), person \\(A_{1}\\) receives 2 pennies, person \\(A_{2}\\) receives 0 pennies, person \\(A_{3}\\) receives 1 penny, and person \\(A_{4}\\) receives 2 pennies.

Four student houses, A, B, C, and D often order pizza. Their patterns of pizza ordering can be modeled as a graph. The graph contains seven vertices -- three vertices for the three pizza parlors, and four vertices for the four student houses.

(Later, we might also choose to weight the edge by the number of pizzas ordered from that parlor over the last month.)\nThis graph has a particular structure: there are no edges between two pizza parlors, since a pizza parlor never orders pizza from another parlor; similarly, there are no edges between two houses, since no house ever orders pizza from another house!\nMany problems in graph theory involve matching two different types of objects, like students with jobs, or pets with owners.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 8.2.8**.: A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) is **bipartite** if \\(V\\) is the disjoint union of two sets \\(L\\) (left) and \\(R\\) (right) and every edge connects a vertex in \\(L\\) with a vertex in \\(R\\).\nIn other words, there are no edges between two vertices in \\(L\\) and no edges between two vertices in \\(R\\).\nFigure 8.6: Bipartite graph with three vertices on the left corresponding to pizza parlors, and four vertices on the right corresponding to houses.

In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\dots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1.\\]\nBy convention, we set \\(0!=1\\).

For \\(x_{n}\\), there are \\(m-n+1\\) choices, because we can use any element of \\(X\\) except \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots x_{n-1}\\). Noting that\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)(m-2)\\dots(m-n+1),\\]\nour proof is complete.\nNote that the answer we arrived at in Example 2.5 is simply \\(P(26,6)\\) as we would expect in light of Proposition 2.6.\n**Example 2.7**.: It's time to elect a slate of four class officers (President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer) from the pool of 80 students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. If any interested student could be elected to any position (Alice contends this is a big \"if\" since Bob is running), how many different slates of officers can be elected?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nA recurring theme in this course has been to count the number of integer solutions to an equation of the form \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\dots+x_{k}=n\\). What if we wanted to count the number of such solutions but didn't care what \\(k\\) was? How about if we took this new question and required that the \\(x_{i}\\) be **distinct** (i.e., \\(x_{i}\\neq x_{j}\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\))? What about if we required that each \\(x_{i}\\) be odd? These certainly don't seem like easy questions to answer at first, but generating functions will allow us to say something very interesting about the answers to the last two questions.\nBy a **partition**\\(P\\) of an integer, we mean a collection of (not necessarily distinct) positive integers such that \\(\\sum_{i\\in P}i=n\\). (By convention, we will write the elements of \\(P\\) from largest to smallest.) For example, \\(2+2+1\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). For each \\(n\\geq 0\\), let \\(p_{n}\\) denote the number of partitions of the integer \\(n\\) (with \\(p_{0}=1\\) by convention). Note that \\(p_{8}=22\\) as evidenced by the list in Figure 8.15. Note that there are \\(6\\) partitions of \\(8\\) into _distinct_ parts. Also there are \\(6\\) partitions of \\(8\\) into _odd_ parts. While it might seem that this is a coincidence, it in fact is always the case as Theorem 8.16 states. Before looking at that theorem and its proof, let's think about what a generating function for \\(p_{n}\\), the number of partitions of \\(n\\), would look like. Given a partition of \\(n\\), we can count how many \\(1\\)'s appear, how many \\(2\\)'s appear, and so on. This suggests a similarity with our fruit basket problems earlier in the chapter, leading to the generating function\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\n\n",

Then the maximum size of a family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of subsets of \\([n]\\) subject to the restrictions that (1) \\(A\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset\\) for all \\(A,B\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), and (2) \\(|A|=k\\) for all \\(A\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), is \\(\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\)._\nProof.: For the lower bound, consider the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of all \\(k\\) element subset of \\([n]\\) that contain 1.\nFor the upper bound, let \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be a family of subsets of \\([n]\\) satisfying the two constraints. We show that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\). To accomplish this, we consider a circle in the Euclidean plane with \\(n\\) points \\(p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\) equally spaced points around its circumference.

To prove this, let \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation and suppose that \\(|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|=s\\geq 1\\). Then the union of the sets from \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) is a set of points that form a consecutive block of points on the circle. Note that since \\(n\\geq 2k\\), this block does not encompass the entire circle. Accordingly there is a set \\(S\\) whose elements are the first \\(k\\) in a clockwise sense within this block. Since each other set in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) represents a clockwise shift of one of more positions, it follows immediately that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq k\\).

These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right. Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n**Example 5.6.11**.: If 17 people are seated in a circle of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 6 chairs are filled with people.\n_Answer._ The 3 empty chairs partition the circle into \\(n=3\\) \"boxes\" of consecutively filled chairs. Let \\(k+1=6\\), so \\(k=5\\). Since \\(17>15=5\\cdot 3=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=6\\) objects, which are consecutively filled chairs.\nOne of the most fun applications of the pigeonhole principle is to _Ramsey theory_. Here we give one example of this.\n**Example 5.6.12**.: Consider the complete graph \\(K_{6}\\) with 6 vertices (every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge). If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nBefore we proceed to the proof, note that the calculation in Burnside's lemma for the example of 2-coloring the vertices of a square is exactly the calculation we performed at the end of Section 15.1.\nProof.: Let \\(X=\\{(\\pi,C)\\in G\\times\\mathcal{C}\\colon\\pi(C)=C\\}\\). Notice that \\(\\sum_{\\pi\\in G}|\\operatorname{fix}_{\\mathcal{C}}(\\pi)|=|X|\\), since each term in the sum counts how many ordered pairs of \\(X\\) have \\(\\pi\\) in their first coordinate. Similarly, \\(\\sum_{C\\in C}|\\operatorname{stab}_{G}(C)|=|X|\\), with each term of this sum counting how many ordered pairs of \\(X\\) have \\(C\\) as their second coordinate. Thus, \\(\\sum_{\\pi\\in G}|\\operatorname{fix}_{\\mathcal{C}}(\\pi)|=\\sum_{C\\in C}| \\operatorname{stab}_{G}(C)|\\). Now note that the latter sum may be rewritten as\n\\[\\sum_{\\begin{subarray}{c}\\text{equivalence}\\\\ \\text{classes }\\langle C\\rangle\\end{subarray}}\\left(\\sum_{C^{\\prime}\\in \\langle C\\rangle}|\\operatorname{stab}_{G}(C^{\\prime})|\\right).\\]\nBy Proposition 15.8, the inner sum is \\(|G|\\). Therefore, the total sum is \\(N\\cdot|G|\\), so solving for \\(N\\) gives the desired equation.\nBurnside's lemma helpfully validates the computations we did in the previous section. However, what if instead of a square we were working with a hexagon and instead of two colors we allowed four? Then there would be \\(4^{6}=4096\\) different colorings and the dihedral group of the hexagon has \\(12\\) elements. Assembling the analogue of Table 15.2 in this situation would be a nightmare! This is where the genius of Polya's approach comes into play, as we see in the next section.\n\n\n",

In how many ways can he\nmake such a distribution? At first, this looks a lot like the problem of enumerating integers solutions of equations, except here the lottery tickets are not identical! A ticket bearing the numbers 1, 3, 10, 23, 47, and 50 will almost surely not pay out the same amount as one with the numbers 2, 7, 10, 30, 31, and 48, so who gets which ticket really makes a difference. Hopefully, you have already recognized that the fact that we're dealing with lottery tickets and grandchildren isn't so important here. Rather, the important fact is that we want to distribute distinguishable objects to distinct entities, which calls for counting functions from one set (lottery tickets) to another (grandchildren). In our example, we don't simply want the total number of functions, but instead we want the number of surjections, so that we can ensure that every grandchild gets a ticket.\nFor positive integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), let \\(S(n,m)\\) denote the number of surjections from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Note that \\(S(n,m)=0\\) when \\(n<m\\). In this section, we apply the Inclusion-Exclusion formula to determine a formula for \\(S(n,m)\\). We start by setting \\(X\\) to be the set of all functions from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\).

We started in Chapter 2 by asking how many ways there were to distribute 40 apples to 5 children so that each child is guaranteed to get at least one apple and saw that the answer was \\(C(39,4)\\). We even saw how to restrict the situation so that one of the children was limited and could receive at most 10 apples. In Chapter 7, we learned how to extend the restrictions so that more than one child had restrictions on the number of apples allowed by taking advantage of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Before moving on to see how generating functions can allow us to get even more creative with our restrictions, let's take a moment to see how generating functions would allow us to solve the most basic problem at hand.\n**Example 8.4**.: We already know that the number of ways to distribute \\(n\\) apples to 5 children so that each child gets at least one apple is \\(C(n-1,4)\\), but it will be instructive to see how we can derive this result using generating functions. Let's start with an even simpler problem: how many ways are there to distribute \\(n\\) apples to _one_ child so that each child receives at least one apple? Well, this isn't too hard, there's only one way to do it--give all the apples to the lucky kid! Thus the _sequence_ that enumerates the number of ways to do this is \\(\\{a_{n}\\colon n\\geq 1\\}\\) with \\(a_{n}=1\\) for all \\(n\\geq 1\\). Then the generating function for this sequence is\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n**Example 3.5.13**.: When \\(k=5\\) and \\(n=4\\), for the multiset \\(\\{A_{1},A_{1},A_{3},A_{4},A_{4}\\}\\), person \\(A_{1}\\) receives 2 pennies, person \\(A_{2}\\) receives 0 pennies, person \\(A_{3}\\) receives 1 penny, and person \\(A_{4}\\) receives 2 pennies. As another example, if person \\(A_{2}\\) receives all the pennies, then the multiset is \\(\\{A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2}\\}\\).\n\n\n",

Here we repeat the proof from Method 1, using the vocabulary of sets. By Theorem 3.3.9, the number of _ordered_ subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). However, that counts each unordered subset \\(k!\\) times, since \\(k!\\) is the number of permutations of \\(k\\) objects (Theorem 3.3.4).

How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Theorem 4.6.3**.: _The number of ordered set partitions of an \\(n\\)-element set \\(S\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) is the multinomial coefficient_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdots k_{m}!}.\\]\nProof.: We count the number of ordered set partitions of a set \\(S\\) of size \\(n\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) as follows. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\). Out of the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements, there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{(n-k_{1})!}{k_{2}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2})}\\) ways to choose the next block \\(B_{2}\\). If \\(m\\geq 3\\), there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}!}=\\frac{(n-k_{1}-k_{2})!}{k_{3}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2}-k_ {3})!}\\) ways to choose the third block \\(B_{3}\\), and so on. Multiplying these together, all the factorials cancel except for \\(n!\\) in the numerator and the terms \\(k_{1}!,\\ldots,k_{m}!\\) in the denominator. The result follows.\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\).

We started in Chapter 2 by asking how many ways there were to distribute 40 apples to 5 children so that each child is guaranteed to get at least one apple and saw that the answer was \\(C(39,4)\\). We even saw how to restrict the situation so that one of the children was limited and could receive at most 10 apples. In Chapter 7, we learned how to extend the restrictions so that more than one child had restrictions on the number of apples allowed by taking advantage of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Before moving on to see how generating functions can allow us to get even more creative with our restrictions, let's take a moment to see how generating functions would allow us to solve the most basic problem at hand.\n**Example 8.4**.: We already know that the number of ways to distribute \\(n\\) apples to 5 children so that each child gets at least one apple is \\(C(n-1,4)\\), but it will be instructive to see how we can derive this result using generating functions. Let's start with an even simpler problem: how many ways are there to distribute \\(n\\) apples to _one_ child so that each child receives at least one apple? Well, this isn't too hard, there's only one way to do it--give all the apples to the lucky kid! Thus the _sequence_ that enumerates the number of ways to do this is \\(\\{a_{n}\\colon n\\geq 1\\}\\) with \\(a_{n}=1\\) for all \\(n\\geq 1\\). Then the generating function for this sequence is\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n**Example 3.5.13**.: When \\(k=5\\) and \\(n=4\\), for the multiset \\(\\{A_{1},A_{1},A_{3},A_{4},A_{4}\\}\\), person \\(A_{1}\\) receives 2 pennies, person \\(A_{2}\\) receives 0 pennies, person \\(A_{3}\\) receives 1 penny, and person \\(A_{4}\\) receives 2 pennies. As another example, if person \\(A_{2}\\) receives all the pennies, then the multiset is \\(\\{A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2}\\}\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 10.4 Ramsey theory\nWe conclude this chapter with a famous topic in graph optimization known as _Ramsey theory_. We start with a classical example.\n**Example 10.4.1**.: Six people walk into a room; some of the people know each other already and others do not. Prove that either some three of them all mutually know each other, or some three of them all mutually do not know each other.\nTo get a handle on the above problem, we can first model it as a graph theory problem; consider a graph on \\(6\\) vertices that represent the people, and where each pair of people is connected either by a solid or dashed edge according to whether they know each other or not, as shown:\nIn the above graph, notice that the vertices numbered \\(3,4,6\\) all mutually do not know each other. Their induced subgraph is a smaller complete graph \\(K_{3}\\), with all its edges the same \"color\" (where the two colors are solid and dashed in this case, but any two colors would work). To state our problem more precisely in terms of graphs, we make the following two definitions.\n**Definition 10.4.2**.: An \\(m\\)**-clique** in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to \\(K_{m}\\).\n\n\n",

It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges.

Since \\(\\iota^{*}(C)=C\\) for all \\(C\\in\\mathcal{C}\\), \\(\\sim\\) is reflexive. If \\(\\tau_{1}^{*}(C_{i})=C_{j}\\) and \\(\\tau_{2}^{*}(C_{j})=C_{k}\\), then \\(\\tau_{2}^{*}(\\tau_{1}^{*}(C_{i}))=C_{k}\\), so \\(\\sim\\) is transitive. To complete our verification that \\(\\sim\\) is an equivalence relation, we must establish that it is symmetric. For this, we require the notion of the **inverse** of a transformation \\(\\tau\\), which is simply the transformation \\(\\tau^{-1}\\) that undoes whatever \\(\\tau\\) did. For instance, the inverse of \\(r_{1}\\) is the _counter_clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), which has the same effect on the location of the vertices as \\(r_{3}\\). If \\(\\tau^{*}(C_{i})=C_{j}\\), then \\({\\tau^{-1}}^{*}(C_{j})=C_{i}\\), so \\(\\sim\\) is symmetric.\nBefore proceeding to establish the connection between the number of nonequivalent colorings (equivalence classes under \\(\\sim\\)) and the number of colorings fixed by a transformation in full generality, let's see how it looks for our example. In looking at Figure 15.1, you should notice that \\(\\sim\\) partitions \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) into six equivalence classes. Two contain one coloring each (the all white and all gold colorings). One contains two colorings (\\(C_{10}\\) and \\(C_{11}\\)). Finally, three contain four colorings each (one gold vertex, one white vertex, and the remaining four with two vertices of each color). Now look again at Table 15.2 and add up the number of colorings fixed by each transformation. In doing this, we obtain 48, and when 48 is divided by the number of transformations (8), we get 6 (the number of equivalence classes)! It turns out that this is far from a fluke, as we will soon see. First, however, we introduce the concept of a permutation group to generalize our set of transformations of the square.\n\n\n",

If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.

By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class.

Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy.

In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3.

There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\).

In this case, there are exactly \\((p-m)+(q-n)\\) moves, of which \\(p-m\\) are horizontal.\n**Example 2.28**.: Let \\(n\\) be a non-negative integer.

A lattice path from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((n,n)\\) is just a \\(\\{H,V\\}\\)-string of length \\(2n\\) with exactly \\(n\\)\\(H\\)'s. So \\(|\\mathcal{P}|=\\binom{2n}{n}\\). We classify the paths in \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) as _good_ if they never go over the diagonal; otherwise, they are _bad_. A string \\(s\\in\\mathcal{P}\\) is good if the number of \\(V\\)'s in an initial segment of \\(s\\) never exceeds the number of \\(H\\)'s. For example, the string \"\\(HHVHVVHHHVHVVV\\)\" is a good lattice path from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((7,7)\\), while the path \"\\(HVHVHHVVVVHVHV\\)\" is bad.

Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom.

By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 2.23**.: Suppose we redo the preceding problem but drop the restriction that each of the four employees gets at least one folder. Now how many ways can the distribution be made?\nFigure 2.22: Distributing Identical Objects into Distinct Cells\nSolution.The solution involves a \"trick\" of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by _artificially_ inflating everyone's allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get 7 folders, we say that he will get 8. Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by 4, one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of \\(22=18+4\\) folders. Again, choose 3 gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less--and may be zero. So the answer is \\(C(21,3)\\).\n**Example 2.24**.: Again we have the same problem as before, but now we want to count the number of distributions where only Audrey and Cecilia are guaranteed to get a folder. Bart and Darren are allowed to get zero folders. Now the trick is to artificially inflate Bart and Darren's allocation, but leave the numbers for Audrey and Cecilia as is. So the answer is \\(C(19,3)\\).\n\n\n",

We define the _chromatic polynomial_ of \\(G\\) as the polynomial whose value at the input \\(k\\) is the number of \\(k\\)-colorings.\nHere is an application to a real-world scenario. Suppose you have \\(k\\) employees and \\(n\\) jobs and some of the jobs conflict with each other, then how many ways are there to assign the employees to the jobs? In this scenario, let \\(G\\) be the labeled graph with \\(n\\) vertices, where the vertices are labeled by the \\(n\\) jobs, and an\nedge is drawn between the vertices for two jobs exactly when those jobs conflict. Each employee is assigned one of the \\(k\\) colors. Making an assignment of the employees to the jobs is the same as making a \\(k\\)-coloring of \\(G\\). If the number of employees is less than the chromatic number \\(C(G)\\), then there is no way to create a proper vertex-coloring of a graph. However, for any \\(k\\geq C(G)\\), we want to find a way to represent the number of different vertex-colorings. In fact, we can do such a thing with a polynomial. Now we want to study the number of ways to \\(k\\)-color a labeled graph.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Remark 3.3.5**.: If there are 0 objects, then there is only one way to arrange them (do nothing).

Therefore, we set \\(0!=1\\).\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 14.2 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs\nAs an example, in Figure 14.3, the thick edges form a matching from \\(V_{1}\\) to \\(V_{2}\\). Suppose that you're the manager of these workers (on the bottom) and must assign them to the jobs (on the top). Are you really making the best use of your resources by only putting four of six workers to work? There are no trivial ways to improve the number of busy workers, as the two without responsibilities right now cannot do any of the jobs that are unassigned. Perhaps there's a more efficient assignment that can be made by redoing some of the assignments, however. If there is, how should you go about finding it? If there is not, how would you justify to your boss that there's no better assignment of workers to jobs?\nAt the end of the section, we'll briefly look at a theorem on matchings in bipartite graphs that tells us precisely when an assignment of workers to jobs exists that ensures each worker has a job. First, however, we want to see how network flows can be used to find maximum matchings in bipartite graphs. The algorithm we give, while decent, is not the most efficient algorithm known for this problem. Therefore, it is not likely to be the one used in practice. However, it is a nice example of how network flows can be used to solve a combinatorial problem. The network that we use is formed from a bipartite graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) by placing an edge from the source \\(S\\) to each vertex of \\(V_{1}\\) and an edge from each vertex of \\(V_{2}\\) to the sink \\(T\\). The edges between \\(V_{1}\\) and \\(V_{2}\\) are oriented from \\(V_{1}\\) to \\(V_{2}\\), and _every_ edge is given capacity \\(1\\). Figure 14.4 contains the network corresponding to our graph from Figure 14.2. Edges in this network are all oriented from bottom to top and all edges have capacity \\(1\\). The vertices in \\(V_{1}\\) are \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{6}\\) in order from left to right, while the vertices in \\(V_{2}\\) are \\(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{7}\\) from left to right.\n\n\n",

There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\). Out of the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements, there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{(n-k_{1})!}{k_{2}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2})}\\) ways to choose the next block \\(B_{2}\\). If \\(m\\geq 3\\), there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}!}=\\frac{(n-k_{1}-k_{2})!}{k_{3}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2}-k_ {3})!}\\) ways to choose the third block \\(B_{3}\\), and so on. Multiplying these together, all the factorials cancel except for \\(n!\\) in the numerator and the terms \\(k_{1}!,\\ldots,k_{m}!\\) in the denominator. The result follows.\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\).

The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n#### Fun with infinite products\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nSince we're only after the cycle index of \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), we don't need to find all 24 permutations in the pair group. However, we do need to know the types of those permutations in terms of cycle lengths so we can associate the appropriate monomials. For the three examples we've considered, the cycle structure of the permutation in the pair group doesn't depend on the original permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) other than for _its_ cycle structure. Any permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a 2-cycle and two 1-cycles will correspond to a permutation with two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\). A permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) with one 3-cycle and one 1-cycle will correspond to a permutation with two 3-cycles in the pair group. By considering an example of a permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a single 4-cycle, we find that the corresponding permutation in the pair group has a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. Finally, a permutation of \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of two 2-cycles corresponds to a permutation in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\) having two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles. (Exercise 15.6.8 asks you to verify these claims using specific permutations.)\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nA recurring theme in this course has been to count the number of integer solutions to an equation of the form \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\dots+x_{k}=n\\). What if we wanted to count the number of such solutions but didn't care what \\(k\\) was? How about if we took this new question and required that the \\(x_{i}\\) be **distinct** (i.e., \\(x_{i}\\neq x_{j}\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\))? What about if we required that each \\(x_{i}\\) be odd? These certainly don't seem like easy questions to answer at first, but generating functions will allow us to say something very interesting about the answers to the last two questions.\nBy a **partition**\\(P\\) of an integer, we mean a collection of (not necessarily distinct) positive integers such that \\(\\sum_{i\\in P}i=n\\). (By convention, we will write the elements of \\(P\\) from largest to smallest.) For example, \\(2+2+1\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). For each \\(n\\geq 0\\), let \\(p_{n}\\) denote the number of partitions of the integer \\(n\\) (with \\(p_{0}=1\\) by convention). Note that \\(p_{8}=22\\) as evidenced by the list in Figure 8.15. Note that there are \\(6\\) partitions of \\(8\\) into _distinct_ parts. Also there are \\(6\\) partitions of \\(8\\) into _odd_ parts. While it might seem that this is a coincidence, it in fact is always the case as Theorem 8.16 states. Before looking at that theorem and its proof, let's think about what a generating function for \\(p_{n}\\), the number of partitions of \\(n\\), would look like. Given a partition of \\(n\\), we can count how many \\(1\\)'s appear, how many \\(2\\)'s appear, and so on. This suggests a similarity with our fruit basket problems earlier in the chapter, leading to the generating function\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations.

For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\nconsist of two 2-cycles, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose two elements for the first 2-cycle. The other two are then put in the second 2-cycle. However, this counts each permutation twice, once for when the first 2-cycle is the chosen pair and once for when it is the \"other two.\" Thus, there are 3 permutations consisting of two 2-cycles. Finally, only \\(\\iota\\) consists of four 1-cycles.\n\n\n",

Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of 80 students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the \"first\" seat on the executive council and her winning the \"fourth\" seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the 80 students without any regard to order. We'll return to this question after introducing our next concept.\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers.

By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class.

Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nTo motivate the topic of this section, we consider another variant on the officer election problem from Example 2.7.

You can think of a polygonal arc as just a finite sequence of line segments such that the endpoint of one line segment is the starting point of the next line segment, and a simple polygonal arc is one that does not cross itself. (Our choice of polygonal arcs rather than arbitrary curves actually doesn't cause an impediment, since by taking very, very, very short line segments we can approximate any curve.) A **planar drawing** of a graph is one in which the polygonal arcs corresponding to two edges intersect only at a point corresponding to a vertex to which they are both incident. A graph is **planar** if it has a planar drawing. A **face** of a planar drawing of a graph is a region bounded by edges and vertices and not containing any other vertices or edges.\nFigure 5.30 shows a planar drawing of a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges. Notice how one of the edges is drawn as a true polygonal arc rather than a straight line segment. This drawing determines 5 regions, since we also count the unbounded region that surrounds the drawing.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nOur next example takes us back to one of the motivating problems discussed in Chapter 1. In Figure 9.5, we show a family of 4 lines in the plane. Each pair of lines intersects and no point in the plane belongs to more than two lines. These lines determine 11 regions.\nWe ask how many regions a family of 1000 lines would determine, given these same restrictions on how the lines intersect. More generally, let \\(r_{n}\\) denote the number of regions determined by \\(n\\) lines. Evidently, \\(r_{1}=2\\), \\(r_{2}=4\\), \\(r_{3}=7\\) and \\(r_{4}=11\\). Now it is easy to see that we have the recurrence \\(r_{n+1}=r_{n}+n+1\\). To see this, choose any one of the \\(n+1\\) lines and call it \\(l\\). Line \\(l\\) intersects each of the other lines and since no point in the plane belongs to three or more lines, the points where \\(l\\) intersects the other lines are distinct. Label them consecutively as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\). Then these points divide line \\(l\\) into \\(n+1\\) segments, two of which (first and last) are infinite. Each of these segments partitions one of the regions determined by the other \\(n\\) lines into two parts, meaning we have the \\(r_{n}\\) regions determined by the other \\(n\\) lines and \\(n+1\\) new regions that \\(l\\) creates.\n\n\n",

By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Example 3.4.3**.: How many ways are there to select the top 25 NCAA DI football teams (of which there are 128) without ranking them?\nThis is the number of (unordered) subsets of size 25, giving \\(\\binom{128}{25}=\\frac{128!}{25!(128-25)!}=\\frac{128!}{25!103!}\\)\n**Example 3.4.4**.: The number of ways to pick 4 winners out of 107 entrants for the _Ice Cream for a Year_ contest is \\(\\binom{107}{4}=\\frac{107!}{4!\\cdot 103!}=5,160,610\\).\nChoosing the four winners in Example 3.4.4 is the same as eliminating the 103 people who did not win. So the number of ways to choose 103 people out of 107 gives the same answer. This leads us to the following corollary, which is often used to simplify problems.\n**Corollary 3.4.5**.: _These two binomial coefficients are equal: \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\)._\nSurprisingly, the formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) can also be useful in counting certain sequences or strings.\n**Example 3.4.6**.: How many binary strings (from the alphabet \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) have exactly \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-k\\) ones? To form such a binary string, we simply have to choose \\(k\\) positions for the 0's, out of \\(n\\) possible positions. This is the same as choosing an _unordered_ subset of \\(k\\) of the positions in the string (even though the string itself is ordered). Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nProof of Proposition 5.4.9 for \\(n\\) even (and odd).: Since \\(\\Omega\\) is nonempty, pick a distinguished element, say \\(1\\in\\Omega\\). Group the subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) into pairs where the two subsets in each pair differ only in whether they contain \\(1\\) or not. Every subset is in exactly one pair. Each pair contains one subset of even size and one subset of odd size. So the number of subsets of odd size and of even size is the same.\nAs another example of a bijective proof, we prove the \"sticks and stones\" theorem (Theorem 3.5.6) again here, using \"M&M's and toothpicks\" instead. The logic we used in Section 3.5 to prove this result is really a bijection in disguise.\n**Proposition 5.4.12**.: _Suppose \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer such that \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). Then the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\) (with repeats allowed) is_\n\\[\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\\]\nProof.: We first find a set \\(A\\) whose size is the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\). To do this, let \\(A\\) be the set of cups filled with \\(k\\) M&M's, where there are \\(n\\) different possible colors of M&M's.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Theorem 7.12**.: _For a positive integer \\(n\\), let \\(d_{n}\\) denote the number of derangements of \\([n]\\). Then_\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{d_{n}}{n!}=\\frac{1}{e}.\\]\n_Equivalently, the fraction of all permutations of \\([n]\\) that are derangements approaches \\(1/e\\) as \\(n\\) increases._\nProof.: It is easy to see that\n\\[\\frac{d_{n}}{n!} =\\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)!}{n!}\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\frac{(n-k)!}{n!}\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\\frac{1}{k!}.\\]\nRecall from Calculus that the Taylor series expansion of \\(e^{x}\\) is given by\n\\[e^{x}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^{k}}{k!},\\]\nand thus the result then follows by substituting \\(x=-1\\).\nUsually we're not as interested in \\(d_{n}\\) itself as we are in enumerating permutations with certain restrictions, as the following example illustrates.\n**Example 7.13**.: Consider the Hat Check problem, but suppose instead of wanting no man to leave with his own hat, we are interested in the number of ways to distribute the \\(100\\) hats so that precisely \\(40\\) of the men leave with their own hats.\nIf \\(40\\) men leave with their own hats, then there are \\(60\\) men who do not receive their own hats. There are \\(C(100,60)\\) ways to choose the \\(60\\) men who will not receive their own hats and \\(d_{60}\\) ways to distribute those hats so that no man receives his own.

Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow let's see how the number of 2-colorings of the square fixed by a permutation can be determined from its cycle structure and associated monomial. If \\(\\pi(i)=j\\), then we know that for \\(\\pi\\) to fix a coloring \\(C\\), vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) must be colored the same in \\(C\\). Thus, the second vertex in a cycle must have the same color as the first. But then the third vertex must have the same color as the second, which is the same color as the first. In fact, all vertices appearing in a cycle of \\(\\pi\\) must have the same color in \\(C\\) if \\(\\pi\\) fixes \\(C\\)! Since we are coloring with the two colors white and gold, we can choose to color the points of each cycle uniformly white or gold. For example, for the permutation \\(v=(12)(34)\\) to fix a coloring of the square, vertices \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) must be colored the same color (\\(2\\) choices) and vertices \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) must be colored the same color (\\(2\\) choices). Thus, there are \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings fixed by \\(v\\). Since there are two choices for how to uniformly color the elements of a cycle, letting \\(x_{i}=2\\) for all \\(i\\) in the monomial associated with \\(\\pi\\) gives the number of colorings fixed by \\(\\pi\\). In Table 15.10, the \"Fixed colorings\" column gives the number of 2-colorings of the square fixed by each permutation. Before, we obtained this manually by considering the action of \\(D_{8}\\) on the set of all 16 colorings. Now we only need the cycle notation and the monomials that result from it to derive this!\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThe next theorem shows that \\(2\\)-colorable graphs are those graphs that do not have any odd cycles.\n**Theorem 12.2.2**.: _A graph \\(G\\) has \\(C(G)\\leq 2\\) if and only if it contains no odd cycles._\nProof.: The forward direction (\\(\\Rightarrow\\)) follows since an odd cycle is not \\(2\\)-colorable, and hence any graph containing an odd cycle is not \\(2\\)-colorable.\nFor the reverse direction (\\(\\Leftarrow\\)), suppose that \\(G\\) contains no odd cycles. Pick a vertex \"\\(a\\)\" and color it red. Color all neighbors of \\(a\\) blue. Then, color all neighbors of the new set of colored vertices red, etc. Continue, alternating coloring the new neighbors red or blue, until all vertices are colored. The first three steps of this process are shown here:\nSuppose for contradiction that two adjacent vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) have the same color in this coloring.\nPick shortest paths from \\(u\\) to \\(a\\) and from \\(v\\) to \\(a\\); these paths alternate colors. Let \\(w\\) be the first junction point of these two paths. The paths from \\(u\\) to \\(w\\) and then reversed from \\(w\\) to \\(v\\), along with edge \\(uv\\), forms an odd cycle; this is a contradiction. Hence \\(G\\) must be \\(2\\)-colorable.\n**Remark 12.2.3**.: The proof of Theorem 12.2.2 also gives an algorithm for deciding if a graph is \\(2\\)-colorable (i.e., if it has no odd cycles).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\n\n",

Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession.

Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 2.7 Multinomial Coefficients\nLet \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\n\n",

What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors.

Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons.

Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Student \\(c\\)**: I've never played cards.

Like 6 of hearts, 6 of clubs, and 6 of diamonds, together with 3 of hearts and 3 of spades. So I'm thinking for the first card, we have 52 choices; no matter what number it is, to get a triple we need to choose two more out of the three remaining cards of that number, and there are three ways to do that. Then there are 48 choices for the next card; no matter what number it is, to get a pair we need to choose one more out of the three remaining cards of that number, and there are three ways to do that. So the answer is:\n\\[52\\cdot 3\\cdot 48\\cdot 3=22464.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: That's over counting again because it doesn't matter which card is dealt first. Instead, let's choose two numbers out of 13, then choose three suits for the first number and then choose two suits for the second number. So the answer is:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Proposition 5.4.12**.: _Suppose \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer such that \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). Then the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\) (with repeats allowed) is_\n\\[\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\\]\nProof.: We first find a set \\(A\\) whose size is the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\). To do this, let \\(A\\) be the set of cups filled with \\(k\\) M&M's, where there are \\(n\\) different possible colors of M&M's.\nNext, we find a set \\(B\\) whose size is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). Let \\(B\\) be the set of binary sequences consisting of \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-1\\) ones. Such a sequence has \\(n+k-1\\) entries total and is determined by choosing which \\(k\\) positions contain the \\(0\\)'s. So the size of \\(B\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\).\nWe need to find a bijective map between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Fix an ordering of colors, for example, rainbow order with brown at the end. An element of the set \\(A\\) is a cup of \\(k\\) colored M&M's. Given such a cup, spill the M&M's onto a plate and sort them by color, in a row. Now there are \\(k\\) M&M's separated into \\(n\\) sections (some of which may be empty). Put a toothpick between each section, using \\(n-1\\) toothpicks total. Finally, put on color-filter goggles so that all the M&M's look grey. What we see is a row of \\(k\\) grey M&M's and \\(n-1\\) toothpicks. Write a sequence of \\(0\\)'s and \\(1\\)'s by writing a \\(0\\) for each grey M&M and writing a \\(1\\) for each toothpick. This results in a sequence of \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-1\\) ones, which is an element of the set \\(B\\).\n\n\n",
