To find \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), we need to find the real number \\(t\\) (or, equivalently, an angle measuring \\(t\\) radians) which lies between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). We know \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) meets these criteria, so \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The value of \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) is a real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). The number we seek is \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Hence, \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). 3. The number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) lies in the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Our answer is \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\). 4. To find \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), we seek the number \\(t\\) in the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). The answer is \\(t=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) so that \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). 5. Since \\(0\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\leq\\pi\\), we could simply invoke Theorem 10.26 to get \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). However, in order to make sure we understand _why_ this is the case, we choose to work the example through using the definition of arccosine. Working from the inside out, \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3 }}{2}\\right)\\). Now, \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\) is the real number \\(t\\) with \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), so that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n27. Analytically show that the function \\(f(x)=x^{3}+3x+1\\) is one-to-one.

Let \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^{2}-1}\\). Using the techniques in Section 4.2, graph \\(y=f(x)\\). Verify that \\(f\\) is one-to-one on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Use the procedure outlined on Page 384 and your graphing calculator to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\). Note that since \\(f(0)=0\\), it should be the case that \\(f^{-1}(0)=0\\). What goes wrong when you attempt to substitute \\(x=0\\) into \\(f^{-1}(x)\\)? Discuss with your classmates how this problem arose and possible remedies.\n29. With the help of your classmates, explain why a function which is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on its entire domain would have to be one-to-one, hence invertible.\n30. If \\(f\\) is odd and invertible, prove that \\(f^{-1}\\) is also odd.\n31. Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be invertible functions. With the help of your classmates show that \\((f\\circ g)\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible, and that \\((f\\circ g)^{-1}(x)=(g^{-1}\\circ f^{-1})(x)\\).\n32. What graphical feature must a function \\(f\\) possess for it to be its own inverse?\n33. What conditions must you place on the values of \\(a,b,c\\) and \\(d\\) in Exercise 24 in order to guarantee that the function is invertible?\n#### Answers\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n4. 1. The function \\(F\\) is given to us as a set of ordered pairs. The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\nWe have shown that the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1 are one-to-one. This means they are invertible, so it is natural to wonder what \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) would be. For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\). We can track step-by-step what is done to \\(x\\) and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter. The function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x}{1-x}\\) is a bit trickier since \\(x\\) occurs in two places. When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem. Theorem 5.2 tells us equation \\(y=f^{-1}(x)\\) is equivalent to \\(f(y)=x\\) and this is the basis of our algorithm.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFollowing this procedure, we get \\(g(x)=\\frac{x-4}{3}\\). Let's check to see if the function \\(g\\) does the job. If \\(x=5\\), then \\(f(5)=3(5)+4=15+4=19\\). Taking the output \\(19\\) from \\(f\\), we substitute it into \\(g\\) to get \\(g(19)=\\frac{19-4}{3}=\\frac{15}{3}=5\\), which is our original input to \\(f\\). To check that \\(g\\) does the job for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), we take the generic output from \\(f\\), \\(f(x)=3x+4\\), and substitute that into \\(g\\). That is, \\(g(f(x))=g(3x+4)=\\frac{(3x+4)-4}{3}=\\frac{3x}{3}=x\\), which is our original input to \\(f\\). If we carefully examine the arithmetic as we simplify \\(g(f(x))\\), we actually see \\(g\\) first 'undoing' the addition of \\(4\\), and then 'undoing' the multiplication by \\(3\\). Not only does \\(g\\) undo \\(f\\), but \\(f\\) also undoes \\(g\\). That is, if we take the output from \\(g\\), \\(g(x)=\\frac{x-4}{3}\\), and put that into \\(f\\), we get \\(f(g(x))=f\\left(\\frac{x-4}{3}\\right)=3\\left(\\frac{x-4}{3}\\right)+4=(x-4)+4=x\\). Using the language of function composition developed in Section 5.1, the statements \\(g(f(x))=x\\) and \\(f(g(x))=x\\) can be written as \\((g\\circ f)(x)=x\\) and \\((f\\circ g)(x)=x\\), respectively. Abstractly, we can visualize the relationship between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in the diagram below.\n### 5.2 Inverse Functions\nThe main idea to get from the diagram is that \\(g\\) takes the outputs from \\(f\\) and returns them to their respective inputs, and conversely, \\(f\\) takes outputs from \\(g\\) and returns them to their respective inputs. We now have enough background to state the central definition of the section.\n**Definition 5.2**.: Suppose \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are two functions such that\n1. \\((g\\circ f)(x)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\)**and**\n2. \\((f\\circ g)(x)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(g\\)\nthen \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are **inverses** of each other and the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are said to be **invertible**.\nWe now formalize the concept that inverse functions exchange inputs and outputs.\n**Theorem 5.2**.: **Properties of Inverse Functions:** Suppose \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are inverse functions.\n* The rangea of \\(f\\) is the domain of \\(g\\) and the domain of \\(f\\) is the range of \\(g\\)\nFootnote a: Recall this is the set of all outputs of a function.\n* \\(f(a)=b\\) if and only if \\(g(b)=a\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe functions in Example 10.5.1 are examples of **sinusoids**. Roughly speaking, a sinusoid is the result of taking the basic graph of \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) or \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\) and performing any of the transformations6 mentioned in Section 1.7. Sinusoids can be characterized by four properties: period, amplitude, phase shift and vertical shift. We have already discussed period, that is, how long it takes for the sinusoid to complete one cycle. The standard period of both \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) and \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\) is \\(2\\pi\\), but horizontal scalings will change the period of the resulting sinusoid. The **amplitude** of the sinusoid is a measure of how 'tall' the wave is, as indicated in the figure below. The amplitude of the standard cosine and sine functions is \\(1\\), but vertical scalings can alter this.\nFootnote 6: We have already seen how the Even/Odd and Cofunction Identities can be used to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\) as a transformed version of \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\), so of course, the reverse is true: \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) can be written as a transformed version of \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\). The authors have seen some instances where sinusoids are always converted to cosine functions while in other disciplines, the sinusoids are always written in terms of sine functions. We will discuss the applications of sinusoids in greater detail in Chapter 11. Until then, we will keep our options open.\n\n\n",

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\nThis has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:\nProof that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Given any \\(\\epsilon\\), pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Then when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), \\(|x+2|<5\\) and \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=L\\), then \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_{n}=L\\).\nAnd a final useful fact:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe can make \\(|g(x)-M|\\) smaller than any fixed number by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\); unfortunately, \\(\\epsilon/(2f(x))\\) is not a fixed number, since \\(x\\) is a variable. Here we need another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing \\(x^{2}\\). We can find a \\(\\delta_{2}\\) so that \\(|x-a|<\\delta_{2}\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<1\\), meaning that \\(L-1<f(x)<L+1\\). This means that \\(|f(x)|<N\\), where \\(N\\) is either \\(|L-1|\\) or \\(|L+1|\\), depending on whether \\(L\\) is negative or positive. The important point is that \\(N\\) doesn't depend on \\(x\\). Finally, we know that there is a \\(\\delta_{3}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{3}\\) implies \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Now we're ready to put everything together. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the smallest of \\(\\delta_{1}\\), \\(\\delta_{2}\\), and \\(\\delta_{3}\\). Then \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), \\(|f(x)|<N\\), and \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&\\leq|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|\\cr&<N{\\epsilon\\over 2N}+ \\Big{|}{\\epsilon\\over 2M}\\Big{|}\\,|M|\\cr&={\\epsilon\\over 2}+{\\epsilon\\over 2}=\\epsilon.\\cr}\\]\nThis is just what we needed, so by the official definition, \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\nA handful of such theorems give us the tools to compute many limits without explicitly working with the definition of limit.\n**Theorem 2.3.6**.: Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\) and \\(k\\) is some constant. Then\n\\[\\eqalign{&\\lim_{x\\to a}kf(x)=k\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=kL\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}(f(x)+g(x))= \\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)+\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L+M\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}(f(x)-g(x))=\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)- \\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L-M\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\cdot\\lim_{x \\to a}g(x)=LM\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}{f(x)\\over g(x)}={\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\over\\lim_{x \\to a}g(x)}={L\\over M},\\hbox{ if }M\\hbox{ is not }0\\cr}\\]\nRoughly speaking, these rules say that to compute the limit of an algebraic expression, it is enough to compute the limits of the \"innermost bits\" and then combine these limits. This often means that it is possible to simply plug in a value for the variable, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}x=a\\).\n**Example 2.3.7**.: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}{x^{2}-3x+5\\over x-2}\\).

It requires more computation and more theorems than the alternative.4 In general, no matter how many theorems you throw at a polynomial, it may well be impossible5 to find their zeros exactly. The polynomial \\(f(x)=x^{5}-x-1\\) is one such beast.6 According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, \\(f\\) has exactly one positive real zero, and it could have two negative real zeros, or none at all. The Rational Zeros\nTest gives us \\(\\pm 1\\) as rational zeros to try but neither of these work since \\(f(1)=f(-1)=-1\\). If we try the substitution technique we used in Example 3.3.4, we find \\(f(x)\\) has three terms, but the exponent on the \\(x^{5}\\) isn't exactly twice the exponent on \\(x\\). How could we go about approximating the positive zero without resorting to the 'Zero' command of a graphing calculator? We use the **Bisection Method**. The first step in the Bisection Method is to find an interval on which \\(f\\) changes sign. We know \\(f(1)=-1\\) and we find \\(f(2)=29\\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, we know that the zero of \\(f\\) lies in the interval \\([1,2]\\). Next, we 'bisect' this interval and find the midpoint is \\(1.5\\). We have that \\(f(1.5)\\approx 5.09\\). This means that our zero is between \\(1\\) and \\(1.5\\), since \\(f\\) changes sign on this interval. Now, we 'bisect' the interval \\([1,1.5]\\) and find \\(f(1.25)\\approx 0.80\\), so now we have the zero between \\(1\\) and \\(1.25\\). Bisecting \\([1,1.25]\\), we find \\(f(1.125)\\approx-0.32\\), which means the zero of \\(f\\) is between \\(1.125\\) and \\(1.25\\). We continue in this fashion until we have 'sandwiched' the zero between two numbers which differ by no more than a desired accuracy. You can think of the Bisection Method as reversing the sign diagram process: instead of finding the zeros and checking the sign of \\(f\\) using test values, we are using test values to determine where the signs switch to find the zeros. It is a slow and tedious, yet fool-proof, method for approximating a real zero.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 3.4 Complex Zeros and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nIn Section 3.3, we were focused on finding the real zeros of a polynomial function. In this section, we expand our horizons and look for the non-real zeros as well. Consider the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^{2}+1\\). The zeros of \\(p\\) are the solutions to \\(x^{2}+1=0\\), or \\(x^{2}=-1\\). This equation has no real solutions, but you may recall from Intermediate Algebra that we can formally extract the square roots of both sides to get \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{-1}\\). The quantity \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is usually re-labeled \\(i\\), the so-called **imaginary unit**.1 The number \\(i\\), while not a real number, plays along well with real numbers, and acts very much like any other radical expression. For instance, \\(3(2i)=6i\\), \\(7i-3i=4i\\), \\((2-7i)+(3+4i)=5-3i\\), and so forth. The key properties which distinguish \\(i\\) from the real numbers are listed below.\nFootnote 1: Some Technical Mathematics textbooks label it ‘\\(j\\)’.\n**Definition 3.4**.: The imaginary unit \\(i\\) satisfies the two following properties\n1. \\(i^{2}=-1\\)\n2. If \\(c\\) is a real number with \\(c\\geq 0\\) then \\(\\sqrt{-c}=i\\sqrt{c}\\)\nProperty 1 in Definition 3.4 establishes that \\(i\\) does act as a square root2 of \\(-1\\), and property 2 establishes what we mean by the 'principal square root' of a negative real number. In property 2, it is important to remember the restriction on \\(c\\). For example, it is perfectly acceptable to say \\(\\sqrt{-4}=i\\sqrt{4}=i(2)=2i\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{-(-4)}\\neq i\\sqrt{-4}\\), otherwise, we'd get\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\\frac{1}{2}&4&-4&-11&12&-3\\\\ \\downarrow&2&-1&-6&3\\\\ \\hline\\frac{1}{2}&4&-2&-12&6&0\\\\ \\downarrow&2&0&-6\\\\ \\hline\\sqrt{3}&\\framebox{4}&0&-12&0\\\\ \\downarrow&4\\sqrt{3}&12\\\\ \\downarrow&4\\sqrt{3}&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4\\sqrt{3}&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4\\sqrt{3}&\\\\ \\hline 4&\\framebox{0}\\end{array}\\]\nThis gives us \\(4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-\\sqrt{3} \\right)\\left(x-\\left(-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\left(4\\right)\\), or, when written with the constant in front\n\\[p(x)=4\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left(- \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\]\nWe have shown that \\(p\\) is a product of its leading coefficient times linear factors of the form \\((x-c)\\) where \\(c\\) are zeros of \\(p\\). It may surprise and delight the reader that, in theory, all polynomials can be reduced to this kind of factorization. We leave that discussion to Section 3.4, because the zeros may not be real numbers. Our final theorem in the section gives us an upper bound on the number of real zeros.\n**Theorem 3.7**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a polynomial of degree \\(n\\geq 1\\). Then \\(f\\) has at most \\(n\\) real zeros, counting multiplicities.\nTheorem 3.7 is a consequence of the Factor Theorem and polynomial multiplication. Every zero \\(c\\) of \\(f\\) gives us a factor of the form \\((x-c)\\) for \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(f\\) has degree \\(n\\), there can be at most \\(n\\) of these factors. The next section provides us some tools which not only help us determine where the real zeros are to be found, but which real numbers they may be.\nWe close this section with a summary of several concepts previously presented. You should take the time to look back through the text to see where each concept was first introduced and where each connection to the other concepts was made.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n2. Solve the inequality \\(2x^{5}+6x^{3}+3\\leq 3x^{4}+8x^{2}\\).\n3. Interpret your answer to part 2 graphically, and verify using a graphing calculator.\n**Solution.**\n1. Finding the real solutions to \\(2x^{5}+6x^{3}+3=3x^{4}+8x^{2}\\) is the same as finding the real solutions to \\(2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3=0\\). In other words, we are looking for the real zeros of \\(p(x)=2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3\\). Using the techniques developed in this section, we get \\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}1&2&-3&6&-8&0&3\\\\ &\\downarrow&2&-1&5&-3&-3\\\\ \\cline{2-5}1&2&-1&5&-3&-3&0\\\\ \\cline{2-5}\\downarrow&2&1&6&3&0\\\\ &\\downarrow&-1&0&-3\\\\ \\cline{2-5}2&0&6&0\\\\ \\end{array}\\] The quotient polynomial is \\(2x^{2}+6\\) which has no real zeros so we get \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=1\\).\n2. To solve this nonlinear inequality, we follow the same guidelines set forth in Section 2.4: we get \\(0\\) on one side of the inequality and construct a sign diagram. Our original inequality can be rewritten as \\(2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3\\leq 0\\). We found the zeros of \\(p(x)=2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3\\) in part 1 to be \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=1\\). We construct our sign diagram as before.\nThe solution to \\(p(x)<0\\) is \\(\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), and we know \\(p(x)=0\\) at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=1\\). Hence, the solution to \\(p(x)\\leq 0\\) is \\(\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac{1}{2}\\right]\\cup\\{1\\}\\).\n3. To interpret this solution graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2x^{5}+6x^{3}+3\\) and \\(g(x)=3x^{4}+8x^{2}\\). We recall that the solution to \\(f(x)\\leq g(x)\\) is the set of \\(x\\) values for which the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\) (where \\(f(x)<g(x)\\)) along with the \\(x\\) values where the two graphs intersect (\\(f(x)=g(x)\\)). Graphing \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) on the calculator produces the picture on the lower left. (The end behavior should tell you which is which.) We see that the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\) on \\(\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\). However, it is difficult to see what is happening near \\(x=1\\). Zooming in (and making the graph of \\(g\\) thicker), we see that the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) do intersect at \\(x=1\\), but the graph of \\(g\\) remains below the graph of \\(f\\) on either side of \\(x=1\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. The Remainder Theorem states \\(p(-2)\\) is the remainder when \\(p(x)\\) is divided by \\(x-(-2)\\). We set up our synthetic division tableau below. We are careful to record the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) as \\(0\\), and proceed as above. \\[\\begin{array}{r|rrr}-2&2&0&-5&3\\\\ &\\downarrow&-4&8&-6\\\\ \\hline 2&-4&3&\\framebox{$-3$}\\end{array}\\] According to the Remainder Theorem, \\(p(-2)=-3\\). We can check this by direct substitution into the formula for \\(p(x)\\): \\(p(-2)=2(-2)^{3}-5(-2)+3=-16+10+3=-3\\).\n2. The Factor Theorem tells us that since \\(x=1\\) is a zero of \\(p\\), \\(x-1\\) is a factor of \\(p(x)\\). To factor \\(p(x)\\), we divide \\[\\begin{array}{r|rrr}1&2&0&-5&3\\\\ &\\downarrow&2&2&-3\\\\ \\hline 2&2&-3&\\framebox{$0$}\\end{array}\\] We get a remainder of \\(0\\) which verifies that, indeed, \\(p(1)=0\\). Our quotient polynomial is a second degree polynomial with coefficients \\(2\\), \\(2\\), and \\(-3\\). So \\(q(x)=2x^{2}+2x-3\\). Theorem 3.4 tells us \\(p(x)=(x-1)\\left(2x^{2}+2x-3\\right)\\). To find the remaining real zeros of \\(p\\), we need to solve \\(2x^{2}+2x-3=0\\) for \\(x\\). Since this doesn't factor nicely, we use the quadratic formula to find that the remaining zeros are \\(x=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{7}}{2}\\).\nIn Section 3.1, we discussed the notion of the multiplicity of a zero. Roughly speaking, a zero with multiplicity \\(2\\) can be divided twice into a polynomial; multiplicity \\(3\\), three times and so on. This is illustrated in the next example.\n**Example 3.2.3.** Let \\(p(x)=4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3\\). Given that \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\) is a zero of multiplicity \\(2\\), find all of the real zeros of \\(p\\).\n\n\n",

The last equation we are asked to solve, \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), poses two immediate problems. First, we are not told whether or not \\(x\\) represents an angle or a real number. We assume the latter, but note that we will use angles and the Unit Circle to solve the equation regardless. Second, as we have mentioned, there is no universally accepted range of the arcsecant function. For that reason, we adopt the advice given in Section 10.3 and convert this to the cosine problem \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Adopting an angle approach, we consider the equation \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and note that our solutions lie in Quadrants II and III. Since \\(-\\frac{3}{5}\\) isn't the cosine of any of the 'common angles', we'll need to express our solutions in terms of the arccosine function. The real number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) is defined so that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). If we let \\(\\beta=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) radians, we see that \\(\\beta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. To obtain a Quadrant III angle solution, we may simply use \\(-\\beta=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\). Since all angle solutions are coterminal with \\(\\beta\\) or \\(-\\beta\\), we get our solutions to \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) to be \\(\\theta=\\beta+2\\pi k=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=-\\beta+2\\pi k=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Switching back to the variable \\(x\\), we record our final answer to \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\) as \\(x=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=4\\) \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) \\(\\cot\\left(3x\\right)=0.87\\)\n**Solution.**\n1.

Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n4. To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\nTo solve \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\), we need the techniques in Chapter 3 to factor \\(4u^{3}-2u-2\\) into \\((u-1)\\left(4u^{2}+4u+2\\right)\\). We get either \\(u-1=0\\) or \\(4u^{2}+2u+2=0\\), and since the discriminant of the latter is negative, the only real solution to \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\) is \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), so \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The only solution which lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) is \\(x=0\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y=2-\\cos(x)\\) on the same set of axes over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) shows that the graphs intersect at what appears to be \\((0,1)\\), as required. \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=3\\cos(x)-2}\\) \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=2-\\cos(x)}\\)\n5. While we could approach \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\) in the same manner as we did the previous two problems, we choose instead to showcase the utility of the Sum to Product Identities. From \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=0\\), and it is the presence of \\(0\\) on the right hand side that indicates a switch to a product would be a good move.7 Using Theorem 10.21, we have that \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=-2\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x+3x}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x-3x}{2} \\right)=-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)\\). Hence, the equation \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is equivalent to \\(-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)=0\\). From this, we get \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=0\\). Solving \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\), and the solution to \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) is \\(x=\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The second set of solutions is contained in the first set of solutions,8 so our final solution to \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\). There are eight of these answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\). Our plot of the graphs of \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y=\\cos(5x)\\) below (after some careful zooming) bears this out. Footnote 7: As always, experience is the greatest teacher here!\n\n\n",

Just as before:\n\\[\\int-\\frac{1}{2}(1-u)\\sqrt{u}\\,du=\\left(\\frac{1}{5}u-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)u^{3/2} +C.\\]\nThen since \\(u=1-x^{2}\\):\n\\[\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\left(\\frac{1}{5}(1-x^{2})-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(1- x^{2})^{3/2}+C.\\]\nTo summarize: if we suspect that a given function is the derivative of another via the chain rule, we let \\(u\\) denote a likely candidate for the inner function, then translate the given function so that it is written entirely in terms of \\(u\\), with no \\(x\\) remaining in the expression. If we can integrate this new function of \\(u\\), then the antiderivative of the original function is obtained by replacing \\(u\\) by the equivalent expression in \\(x\\).\nEven in simple cases you may prefer to use this mechanical procedure, since it often helps to avoid silly mistakes. For example, consider again this simple problem:\n\\[\\int 2x\\cos(x^{2})\\,dx.\\]\nLet \\(u=x^{2}\\), then \\(du/dx=2x\\) or \\(du=2x\\,dx\\). Since we have exactly \\(2x\\,dx\\) in the original integral, we can replace it by \\(du\\):\n\\[\\int 2x\\cos(x^{2})\\,dx=\\int\\cos u\\,du=\\sin u+C=\\sin(x^{2})+C.\\]\nThis is not the only way to do the algebra, and typically there are many paths to the correct answer. Another possibility, for example, is: Since \\(du/dx=2x\\), \\(dx=du/2x\\), and\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFirst we do \\(\\int\\sec u\\,du\\), which we will need to compute \\(\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du\\):\n\\[\\int\\sec u\\,du =\\int\\sec u\\,\\frac{\\sec u+\\tan u}{\\sec u+\\tan u}\\,du\\] \\[=\\int\\frac{\\sec^{2}u+\\sec u\\tan u}{\\sec u+\\tan u}\\,du.\\]\nNow let \\(w=\\sec u+\\tan u\\), \\(dw=\\sec u\\tan u+\\sec^{2}u\\,du\\), exactly the numerator of the function we are integrating. Thus\n\\[\\int\\sec u\\,du=\\int\\frac{\\sec^{2}u+\\sec u\\tan u}{\\sec u+\\tan u} \\,du =\\int\\frac{1}{w}\\,dw=\\ln|w|+C\\] \\[=\\ln|\\sec u+\\tan u|+C.\\]\nNow for \\(\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du\\):\n\\[\\sec^{3}u =\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}=\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}+ \\frac{(\\tan^{2}u+1)\\sec u}{2}\\] \\[=\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec u\\tan^{2}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec u}{2}= \\frac{\\sec^{3}u+\\sec u\\tan^{2}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec u}{2}.\\]\nWe already know how to integrate \\(\\sec u\\), so we just need the first quotient. This is \"simply\" a matter of recognizing the product rule in action:\n\\[\\int\\sec^{3}u+\\sec u\\tan^{2}u\\,du=\\sec u\\tan u.\\]\nSo putting these together we get\n\\[\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du=\\frac{\\sec u\\tan u}{2}+\\frac{\\ln|\\sec u+\\tan u|}{2}+C,\\]\nand reverting to the original variable \\(x\\):\n\\[\\int\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}\\,dx =\\frac{\\sec u\\tan u}{2}+\\frac{\\ln|\\sec u+\\tan u|}{2}+C\\] \\[=\\frac{\\sec(\\arctan x)\\tan(\\arctan x)}{2}+\\frac{\\ln|\\sec(\\arctan x )+\\tan(\\arctan x)|}{2}+C\\] \\[=\\frac{x\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{2}+\\frac{\\ln|\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}+x|}{2}+C,\\]\nusing \\(\\tan(\\arctan x)=x\\) and \\(\\sec(\\arctan x)=\\sqrt{1+\\tan^{2}(\\arctan x)}=\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}\\).\nFind the antiderivatives.\n1. \\(\\int\\csc x\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n2. \\(\\int\\csc^{3}x\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n3. \\(\\int\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n4. \\(\\int\\sqrt{9+4x^{2}}\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n5. \\(\\int x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n7. \\(\\int\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}}\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n9. \\(\\int\\frac{1}{x^{2}(1+x^{2})}\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. \\(\\int\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{1-x}}\\,dx\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n13.

In the first, the inner integral is easy, because we need an anti-derivative with respect to \\(y\\), and the entire integrand \\(\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) is constant with respect to \\(y\\). Of course, the outer integral may be more difficult. In the second, the inner integral is mildly unpleasant--a trig substitution. So let's try the first one, since the first step is easy, and see where that leaves us.\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{x}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{0}^{1}y\\sqrt{1-x^{2}} \\Big{|}_{0}^{x}\\,\\,dx=\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nThis is quite easy, since the substitution \\(u=1-x^{2}\\) works:\n\\[\\int x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=-\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\sqrt{u}\\,du=-\\frac{1}{3}u^{3/2}=- \\frac{1}{3}(1-x^{2})^{3/2}.\\]\nThen\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\left.-\\frac{1}{3}(1-x^{2})^{3/2}\\right|_{0}^{ 1}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThis is a good example of how the order of integration can affect the complexity of the problem. In this case it is possible to do the other order, but it is a bit messier. In some cases one order may lead to a very difficult or impossible integral; it's usually worth considering both possibilities before going very far.\n### Volume and Average Height\n#### Exercises 15.1\n1.

We can also use the Power Rule to write \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=-\\ln(9)\\). Putting these two steps together, we simplify \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\) to \\(-2t=-\\ln(9)\\). We arrive at our solution, \\(t=\\frac{\\ln(9)}{2}\\) which simplifies to \\(t=\\ln(3)\\). (Can you explain why?) The calculator confirms the graphs of \\(f(x)=75\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2x}}\\) intersect at \\(x=\\ln(3)\\approx 1.099\\). 5. We start solving \\(25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\) by rewriting \\(25=5^{2}\\) so that we have \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{x}=5^{x}+6\\), or \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\). Even though we have a common base, having two terms on the right hand side of the equation foils our plan of equating exponents or taking logs. If we stare at this long enough, we notice that we have three terms with the exponent on one term exactly twice that of another. To our surprise and delight, we have a 'quadratic in disguise'. Letting \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(u^{2}=\\left(5^{x}\\right)^{2}=5^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\) becomes \\(u^{2}=u+6\\). Solving this as \\(u^{2}-u-6=0\\) gives \\(u=-2\\) or \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(5^{x}=-2\\) or \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since \\(5^{x}=-2\\) has no real solution, (Why not?) we focus on \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since it isn't convenient to express \\(3\\) as a power of \\(5\\), we take natural logs and get \\(\\ln\\left(5^{x}\\right)=\\ln(3)\\) so that \\(x\\ln(5)=\\ln(3)\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\). On the calculator, we see the graphs of \\(f(x)=25^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=5^{x}+6\\) intersect at \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\approx 0.6826\\). 6. At first, it's unclear how to proceed with \\(\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\), besides clearing the denominator to obtain \\(e^{x}-e^{-x}=10\\). Of course, if we rewrite \\(e^{-x}=\\frac{1}{e^{x}}\\), we see we have another denominator lurking in the problem: \\(e^{x}-\\frac{1}{e^{x}}=10\\). Clearing this denominator gives us \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\), and once again, we have an equation with three terms where the exponent on one term is exactly twice that of another - a 'quadratic in disguise.' If we let \\(u=e^{x}\\), then \\(u^{2}=e^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\) can be viewed as \\(u^{2}-1=10u\\). Solving \\(u^{2}-10u-1=0\\), we obtain by the quadratic formula \\(u=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). From this, we have \\(e^{x}=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). Since \\(5-\\sqrt{26}<0\\), we get no real solution to \\(e^{x}=5-\\sqrt{26}\\), but for \\(e^{x}=5+\\sqrt{26}\\), we take natural logs to obtain \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\). If we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}\\) and \\(g(x)=5\\), we see that the graphs intersect at \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\approx 2.312\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n4. Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\). When we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+3)}{\\ln(2)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln(6-x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\), we find they intersect at \\(x=5\\).\n6. Starting with \\(1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\), we gather the logs to one side to get the equation \\(1=2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\). Before we can combine the logarithms, however, we need a common base. Since 4 is a power of 2, we use change of base to convert \\[\\log_{4}(x+1)=\\frac{\\log_{2}(x+1)}{\\log_{2}(4)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Hence, our original equation becomes \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\right)\\] \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Power Rule \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}\\right)\\] Quotient Rule Rewriting this in exponential form, we get \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}=2\\) or \\(x^{2}-2x-2=0\\). Using the quadratic formula, we get \\(x=1\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\). Graphing \\(f(x)=1+\\frac{2\\ln(x+1)}{\\ln(4)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\), we see the graphs intersect only at \\(x=1+\\sqrt{3}\\approx 2.732\\). The solution \\(x=1-\\sqrt{3}<0\\), which means if substituted into the original equation, the term \\(2\\log_{2}\\left(1-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) is undefined.\n\\(y=f(x)=1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\) and \\(y=g(x)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n2. Moving all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}<2\\log_{2}(x)+3\\) to one side of the inequality, we have \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3<0\\). Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\), we get \\(\\log_{2}(x)=-1\\), which gives us \\(x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\log_{2}(x)=3\\), which yields \\(x=2^{3}=8\\). We use test values which are powers of \\(2\\): \\(0<\\frac{1}{4}<\\frac{1}{2}<1<8<16\\), and from our sign diagram, we see \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},8\\right)\\). Geometrically, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{2}\\) is below the graph of \\(y=g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\) on the solution interval.\n3. We begin to solve \\(x\\log(x+1)\\geq x\\) by subtracting \\(x\\) from both sides to get \\(x\\log(x+1)-x\\geq 0\\). We define \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x\\) and due to the presence of the logarithm, we require \\(x+1>0\\), or \\(x>-1\\). To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x=0\\). Factoring, we get \\(x\\left(\\log(x+1)-1\\right)=0\\), which gives \\(x=0\\) or \\(\\log(x+1)-1=0\\). The latter gives \\(\\log(x+1)=1\\), or \\(x+1=10^{1}\\), which admits \\(x=9\\). We select test values \\(x\\) so that \\(x+1\\) is a power of \\(10\\), and we obtain \\(-1<-0.9<0<\\sqrt{10}-1<9<99\\). Our sign diagram gives the solution to be \\((-1,0]\\cup[9,\\infty)\\). The calculator indicates the graph of \\(y=f(x)=x\\log(x+1)\\) is above \\(y=g(x)=x\\) on the solution intervals, and the graphs intersect at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=9\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe would like to replace \\(\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u}\\) by \\(\\cos u\\), but this is valid only if \\(\\cos u\\) is positive, since \\(\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u}\\) is positive. Consider again the substitution \\(x=\\sin u\\). We could just as well think of this as \\(u=\\arcsin x\\). If we do, then by the definition of the arcsine, \\(-\\pi/2\\leq u\\leq\\pi/2\\), so \\(\\cos u\\geq 0\\).

Suppose two different functions have the same derivative; what can you say about the relationship between the two functions?\n2. Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to another toll booth at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. What can be concluded about your actual speed during the trip? In particular, did you exceed the 65 mile per hour speed limit?\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIf \\(y\\) is written in terms of \\(x\\), i.e., \\(y=f(x)\\), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n**1.**: Decide what the two variables are.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\nAs before, all solutions are represented by \\(y=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}\\), allowing \\(A\\) to be zero. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nand \\(y\\) as particularly simple functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and let \\(f(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\\).

Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nGraphically, we detect one-to-one functions using the test below.\n**Theorem 5.4. The Horizontal Line Test:** A function \\(f\\) is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects the graph of \\(f\\) more than once.\nWe say that the graph of a function **passes** the Horizontal Line Test if no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once; otherwise, we say the graph of the function **fails** the Horizontal Line Test. We have argued that if \\(f\\) is invertible, then \\(f\\) must be one-to-one, otherwise the graph given by reflecting the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) about the line \\(y=x\\) will fail the Vertical Line Test. It turns out that being one-to-one is also enough to guarantee invertibility. To see this, we think of \\(f\\) as the set of ordered pairs which constitute its graph. If switching the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points results in a function, then \\(f\\) is invertible and we have found \\(f^{-1}\\). This is precisely what the Horizontal Line Test does for us: it checks to see whether or not a set of points describes \\(x\\) as a function of \\(y\\). We summarize these results below.\n**Theorem 5.5**.: **Equivalent Conditions for Invertibility:** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function. The following statements are equivalent.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\((x,f(x))\\) & \\(f(x)\\) & \\(g(x)=f(x)+2\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(0\\) & \\((0,1)\\) & \\(1\\) & \\(3\\) & \\((0,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(2\\) & \\((2,3)\\) & \\(3\\) & \\(5\\) & \\((2,5)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(4\\) & \\((4,3)\\) & \\(3\\) & \\(5\\) & \\((4,5)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(5\\) & \\((5,5)\\) & \\(5\\) & \\(7\\) & \\((5,7)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} In general, if \\((a,b)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\), then \\(f(a)=b\\), so \\(g(a)=f(a)+2=b+2\\). Hence, \\((a,b+2)\\) is on the graph of \\(g\\). In other words, to obtain the graph of \\(g\\), we add \\(2\\) to the \\(y\\)-coordinate of each point on the graph of \\(f\\). Geometrically, adding \\(2\\) to the \\(y\\)-coordinate of a point moves the point \\(2\\) units above its previous location. Adding \\(2\\) to every \\(y\\)-coordinate on a graph _en masse_ is usually described as 'shifting the graph up \\(2\\) units'. Notice that the graph retains the same basic shape as before, it is just \\(2\\) units above its original location. In other words, we connect the four points we moved in the same manner in which they were connected before. We have the results side-by-side at the top of the next page.\nYou'll note that the domain of \\(f\\) and the domain of \\(g\\) are the same, namely \\([0,5]\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\([1,5]\\) while the range of \\(g\\) is \\([3,7]\\). In general, shifting a function vertically like this will leave the domain unchanged, but could very well affect the range. You can easily imagine what would happen if we wanted to graph the function \\(j(x)=f(x)-2\\). Instead of adding \\(2\\) to each of the \\(y\\)-coordinates on the graph of \\(f\\), we'd be subtracting \\(2\\). Geometrically, we would be moving the graph down \\(2\\) units. We leave it to the reader to verify that the domain of \\(j\\) is the same as \\(f\\), but the range of \\(j\\) is \\([-1,3]\\). What we have discussed is generalized in the following theorem.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nDoing this gives a volume of approximately 8.84, so the average height is approximately \\(8.84/6\\approx 1.47\\).\nBecause addition and multiplication are commutative and associative, we can rewrite the original double sum:\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x\\Delta y=\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1 }\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta y\\Delta x.\\]\nNow if we repeat the development above, the inner sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta y=\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y) \\,dy,\\]\nand then the outer sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\left(\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y)\\,dy\\right)\\Delta x =\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\nIn other words, we can compute the integrals in either order, first with respect to \\(x\\) then \\(y\\), or vice versa. Thinking of the loaf of bread, this corresponds to slicing the loaf in a direction perpendicular to the first.\nWe haven't really proved that the value of a double integral is equal to the value of the corresponding two single integrals in either order of integration, but provided the function is reasonably nice, this is true; the result is called **Fubini's Theorem**.\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface with slices.

In a coordinate system with its origin at the center of the track, Julian's x-coordinate is changing at a rate of -1.25 m/s when his coordinates are (40, 30). Find dy/dt at this moment.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf \\(y\\) is written in terms of \\(x\\), i.e., \\(y=f(x)\\), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOur goal is to find parametric equations for the coordinates of the point \\(P(x,y)\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\). From our work in Example 11.10.4 number 3, we know that clockwise motion along the Unit Circle starting at the point \\((0,-1)\\) can be modeled by the equations \\(\\{x=-\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-\\cos(\\theta)\\) for \\(0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi\\). (We have renamed the parameter '\\(\\theta\\)' to match the context of this problem.) To model this motion on a circle of radius \\(r\\), all we need to do11 is multiply both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by the factor \\(r\\) which yields \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\). We now need to adjust for the fact that the circle isn't stationary with center \\((0,0)\\), but rather, is rolling along the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Since the velocity \\(v\\) is constant, we know that at time \\(t\\), the center of the circle has traveled a distance \\(vt\\) down the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Furthermore, since the radius of the circle is \\(r\\) and the circle isn't moving vertically, we know that the center of the circle is always \\(r\\) units above the \\(x\\)-axis. Putting these two facts together, we have that at time \\(t\\), the center of the circle is at the point \\((vt,r)\\). From Section 10.1.1, we know \\(v=\\frac{r\\theta}{t}\\), or \\(vt=r\\theta\\). Hence, the center of the circle, in terms of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), is \\((r\\theta,r)\\). As a result, we need to modify the equations \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\) by shifting the \\(x\\)-coordinate to the right \\(r\\theta\\) units (by adding \\(r\\theta\\) to the expression for \\(x\\)) and the \\(y\\)-coordinate up \\(r\\) units12 (by adding \\(r\\) to the expression for \\(y\\)). We get \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta)+r\\theta,\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)+r\\,,\\) which can be written as \\(\\{x=r(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta)),\\,y=r(1-\\cos(\\theta))\\,\\). Since the motion starts at \\(\\theta=0\\) and proceeds indefinitely, we set \\(\\theta\\geq 0\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n3. The London Eye is a popular tourist attraction in London, England and is one of the largest Ferris Wheels in the world. It has a diameter of 135 meters and makes one revolution (counter-clockwise) every 30 minutes. It is constructed so that the lowest part of the Eye reaches ground level, enabling passengers to simply walk on to, and off of, the ride. Find a sinusoid which models the height \\(h\\) of the passenger above the ground in meters \\(t\\) minutes after they board the Eye at ground level.\n4. On page 732 in Section 10.2.1, we found the \\(x\\)-coordinate of counter-clockwise motion on a circle of radius \\(r\\) with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) to be \\(x=r\\cos(\\omega t)\\), where \\(t=0\\) corresponds to the point \\((r,0)\\). Suppose we are in the situation of Exercise 3 above. Find a sinusoid which models the horizontal _displacement_\\(x\\) of the passenger from the center of the Eye in meters \\(t\\) minutes after they board the Eye. Here we take \\(x(t)>0\\) to mean the passenger is to the _right_ of the center, while \\(x(t)<0\\) means the passenger is to the _left_ of the center.\n5. In Exercise 52 in Section 10.1, we introduced the yo-yo trick 'Around the World' in which a yo-yo is thrown so it sweeps out a vertical circle. As in that exercise, suppose the yo-yo string is 28 inches and it completes one revolution in 3 seconds. If the closest the yo-yo ever gets to the ground is 2 inches, find a sinusoid which models the height \\(h\\) of the yo-yo above the ground in inches \\(t\\) seconds after it leaves its lowest point.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 6.2.5**: A swing consists of a board at the end of a 10 ft long rope. Think of the board as a point \\(P\\) at the end of the rope, and let \\(Q\\) be the point of attachment at the other end. Suppose that the swing is directly below \\(Q\\) at time \\(t=0\\), and is being pushed by someone who walks at 6 ft/sec from left to right. Find (a) how fast the swing is rising after 1 sec; (b) the angular speed of the rope in deg/sec after 1 sec.\nWe start out by asking: What is the geometric quantity whose rate of change we know, and what is the geometric quantity whose rate of change we're being asked about? Note that the person pushing the swing is moving horizontally at a rate we know. In other words, the horizontal coordinate of \\(P\\) is increasing at 6 ft/sec. In the \\(xy\\)-plane let us make the convenient choice of putting the origin at the location of \\(P\\) at time \\(t=0\\), i.e., a distance 10 directly below the point of attachment. Then the rate we know is \\(dx/dt\\), and in part (a) the rate we want is \\(dy/dt\\) (the rate at which \\(P\\) is rising). In part (b) the rate we want is \\(\\dot{\\theta}=d\\theta/dt\\), where \\(\\theta\\) stands for the angle in radians through which the swing has swung from the vertical. (Actually, since we want our answer in deg/sec, at the end we must convert \\(d\\theta/dt\\) from rad/sec by multiplying by \\(180/\\pi\\).)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n3.

It turns out to be very useful, and is called the **standard normal probability density function** or more informally the **bell curve**, giving rise to the **standard normal distribution**. See figure 9.8.2 for the graph of the bell curve.\nFigure 9.8.2: The bell curve.\nWe have shown that \\(A\\) is some finite number without computing it; we cannot compute it with the techniques we have available. By using some techniques from multivariable calculus, it can be shown that \\(A=\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\).\n##### 9.8.5 The exponential distribution\nhas probability density function\n\\[f(x)=\\cases{0&$x<0$\\cr ce^{-cx}&$x\\geq 0$\\cr}\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is a positive constant.\nThe mean or expected value of a random variable is quite useful, as hinted at in our discussion of dice. Recall that the mean for a discrete random variable is \\(E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}P(x_{i})\\). In the more general context we use an integral in place of the sum.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nSuppose we want the derivative of \\(f(g(x))\\). Again, let's set up the derivative and play some algebraic tricks:\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}f(g(x))&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x+\\Delta x))-f(g(x)) \\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x+\\Delta x))-f(g(x))\\over g(x+\\Delta x )-g(x)}{g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\over\\Delta x}}\\]\nNow we see immediately that the second fraction turns into \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) when we take the limit. The first fraction is more complicated, but it too looks something like a derivative. The denominator, \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\), is a change in the value of \\(g\\), so let's abbreviate it as \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\), which also means \\(g(x+\\Delta x)=g(x)+\\Delta g\\). This gives us\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x)+\\Delta g)-f(g(x))\\over\\Delta g}.\\]\nAs \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to 0, it is also true that \\(\\Delta g\\) goes to 0, because \\(g(x+\\Delta x)\\) goes to \\(g(x)\\). So we can rewrite this limit as\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta g\\to 0}{f(g(x)+\\Delta g)-f(g(x))\\over\\Delta g}.\\]\nNow this looks exactly like a derivative, namely \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\), that is, the function \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g(x)\\). If this all withstands scrutiny, we then get\n\\[{d\\over dx}f(g(x))=f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x).\\]\nUnfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what we mean by \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\) involves what happens when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 _but not equal to 0_. The qualification is very important, since we must be able to divide by \\(\\Delta x\\). But when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 but not equal to 0, \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x))-g(x)\\) is close to 0 _and possibly equal to 0_. This means it doesn't really make sense to divide by \\(\\Delta g\\). Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to avoid this difficulty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details, which can be found in many calculus books. Note that many functions \\(g\\) do have the property that \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\neq 0\\) when \\(\\Delta x\\) is small, and for these functions the argument above is fine.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x^{2}-3x+7}{x^{2}+47x+1}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{4x-3}{ 2x+47}.\\]\nIn the second quotient, it is still the case that the numerator and denominator both go to infinity, so we are allowed to use L'Hopital's Rule again:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{4x-3}{2x+47}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{4}{2}=2.\\]\nSo the original limit is 2 as well.\nAgain, we don't really need L'Hopital's Rule, and in fact a more elementary approach is easier--we divide the numerator and denominator by \\(x^{2}\\):\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x^{2}-3x+7}{x^{2}+47x+1}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x^{2 }-3x+7}{x^{2}+47x+1}\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2-\\frac{3}{x}+ \\frac{7}{x^{2}}}{1+\\frac{47}{x}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches infinity, all the quotients with some power of \\(x\\) in the denominator approach zero, leaving 2 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator, so the limit again is\n**Example 4.10.8**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}\\).\nBoth the numerator and denominator approach zero, so applying L'Hopital's Rule:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}=\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x\\tan x}{\\cos x}= \\frac{1\\cdot 0}{1}=0.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 4.10.9**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}x\\ln x\\).\nThis doesn't appear to be suitable for L'Hopital's Rule, but it also is not \"obvious\". As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

As in the single variable case, the problem is often simpler when there is a finite boundary.\n**Theorem 14.7.7** If \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous on a closed and bounded subset of \\({R}^{2}\\), then it has both a maximum and minimum value.\n### 14.7 Maxima and minima\nAs in the case of single variable functions, this means that the maximum and minimum values must occur at a critical point or on the boundary; in the two variable case, however, the boundary is a curve, not merely two endpoints.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNote that \\(x^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\leq 1\\) and \\(|y|=\\sqrt{y^{2}}\\leq\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}<\\delta\\). So\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot\\delta.\\]\nWe want to force this to be less than \\(\\epsilon\\) by picking \\(\\delta\\) \"small enough.\" If we choose \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/3\\) then\n\\[\\left|{3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot{\\epsilon\\over 3}=\\epsilon.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\); roughly this says that there is no \"hole\" or \"jump\" at \\(x=a\\). We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form.

However, despite being periodic a constant function has no period. (We'll leave that odd gem as an exercise for you.) Returning to the circular functions, we see that by Definition 10.3, \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) is periodic, since \\(\\cos(t+2\\pi k)=\\cos(t)\\) for any integer \\(k\\). To determine the period of \\(f\\), we need to find the smallest real number \\(p\\) so that \\(f(t+p)=f(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\) or, said differently, the smallest positive real number \\(p\\) such that \\(\\cos(t+p)=\\cos(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\). We know that \\(\\cos(t+2\\pi)=\\cos(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\) but the question remains if any smaller real number will do the trick. Suppose \\(p>0\\) and \\(\\cos(t+p)=\\cos(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\). Then, in particular, \\(\\cos(0+p)=\\cos(0)\\) so that \\(\\cos(p)=1\\). From this we know \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) and, since the smallest positive multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) is \\(2\\pi\\) itself, we have the result. Similarly, we can show \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) is also periodic with \\(2\\pi\\) as its period.2 Having period \\(2\\pi\\) essentially means that we can completely understand everything about the functions \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) and \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) by studying one interval of length \\(2\\pi\\), say \\([0,2\\pi]\\).3\nFootnote 2: Alternatively, we can use the Cofunction Identities in Theorem 10.14 to show that \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\) since \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t\\right)\\).\nFootnote 3: Technically, we should study the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\),4 since whatever happens at \\(t=2\\pi\\) is the same as what happens at \\(t=0\\). As we will see shortly, \\(t=2\\pi\\) gives us an extra ‘check’ when we go to graph these functions.\nFootnote 4: In some advanced texts, the interval of choice is \\([-\\pi,\\pi)\\).\nOne last property of the functions \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) and \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) is worth pointing out: both of these functions are continuous and smooth. Recall from Section 3.1 that geometrically this means the graphs of the cosine and sine functions have no jumps, gaps, holes in the graph, asymptotes,\ncorners or cusps. As we shall see, the graphs of both \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) and \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) meander nicely and don't cause any trouble. We summarize these facts in the following theorem.\n**Theorem 10.22.

We want to know the derivatives at zero: 1, 0, \\(-1\\), 0, 1, 0, \\(-1\\), 0,..., and so the Maclaurin series is\n\\[x-{x^{3}\\over 3!}+{x^{5}\\over 5!}-\\cdots=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n}{x^{2n+1} \\over(2n+1)!}.\\]\nWe should always determine the radius of convergence:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{|x|^{2n+3}\\over(2n+3)!}{(2n+1)!\\over|x|^{2n+1}}=\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}{|x|^{2}\\over(2n+3)(2n+2)}=0,\\]\nso the series converges for every \\(x\\). Since it turns out that this series does indeed converge to \\(\\sin x\\) everywhere, we have a series representation for \\(\\sin x\\) for every \\(x\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSometimes the formula for the \\(n\\)th derivative of a function \\(f\\) is difficult to discover, but a combination of a known Maclaurin series and some algebraic manipulation leads easily to the Maclaurin series for \\(f\\).\n**Example 11.10.3** Find the Maclaurin series for \\(x\\sin(-x)\\).\nTo get from \\(\\sin x\\) to \\(x\\sin(-x)\\) we substitute \\(-x\\) for \\(x\\) and then multiply by \\(x\\).

Geometrically, this is because there are no jumps in the graphs. That is, if you pick a point on the graph and approach it from the left and right, the values of the function approach the value of the function at that point. For example, we can see that this is not true for function values near \\(x=-1\\) on the graph in (a) which is not continuous at that location.\nFigure 2.5.1: Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c) a bounded, differentiable function, (d) an unbounded, differentiable function\n**Definition 2.5.2**: **Continuous at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.3**: **Continuous** A function \\(f\\) is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. \\(\\Box\\)\nStrangely, we also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n**Definition 2.5.4**: **Differentiable at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable at point \\(a\\) if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) exists. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

If we want to say that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\), we need to capture the idea that as \\((x,y)\\) gets close to \\((a,b)\\) then \\(f(x,y)\\) gets close to \\(L\\). For functions of one variable, \\(f(x)\\), there are only two ways that \\(x\\) can approach \\(a\\): from the left or right. But there are an infinite number of ways to approach \\((a,b)\\): along any one of an infinite number of lines, or an infinite number of parabolas, or an infinite number of sine curves, and so on. We might hope that it's really not so bad--suppose, for example, that along every possible line through \\((a,b)\\) the value of \\(f(x,y)\\) gets close to \\(L\\); surely this means that \"\\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(L\\) as \\((x,y)\\) approaches \\((a,b)\\)\". Sadly, no.\n**EXAMPLE 14.2.1** Consider \\(f(x,y)=xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\). When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well. So along every line through the origin \\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(0\\). Now suppose we approach the origin along \\(x=y^{2}\\). Then\n\nDocument 2:\n----\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nNow consider this limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}{x^{2}-\\pi^{2}\\over\\sin x}.\\]\nAs \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\pi\\), both the numerator and denominator approach zero, so it is not obvious what, if anything, the quotient approaches. We can often compute such limits by application of the following theorem.\n**Theorem 4.10.5** L'Hopital's Rule For \"sufficiently nice\" functions \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=0=\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)\\) or both \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=\\pm\\infty\\), and if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}{f^{\\prime}(x)\\over g^{\\prime}(x)}\\) exists, then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}{f(x)\\over g(x)}=\\lim_{x\\to a}{f^{\\prime}(x)\\over g^{ \\prime}(x)}\\). This remains true if \"\\(x\\to a\\)\" is replaced by \"\\(x\\to\\infty\\)\" or \"\\(x\\to-\\infty\\)\". \\(\\blacksquare\\)\nThis theorem is somewhat difficult to prove, in part because it incorporates so many different possibilities, so we will not prove it here. We also will not need to worry about the precise definition of \"sufficiently nice\", as the functions we encounter will be suitable.\n**Example 4.10.6** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}{x^{2}-\\pi^{2}\\over\\sin x}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we use L'Hopital's Rule: Since the numerator and denominator both approach zero,\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}\\frac{x^{2}-\\pi^{2}}{\\sin x}=\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}\\frac{2x}{\\cos x},\\]\nprovided the latter exists. But in fact this is an easy limit, since the denominator now approaches \\(-1\\), so\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}\\frac{x^{2}-\\pi^{2}}{\\sin x}=\\frac{2\\pi}{-1}=-2\\pi.\\]\nWe don't really need L'Hopital's Rule to do this limit. Rewrite it as\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}(x+\\pi)\\frac{x-\\pi}{\\sin x}\\]\nand note that\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}\\frac{x-\\pi}{\\sin x}=\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}\\frac{x-\\pi}{-\\sin(x-\\pi)}= \\lim_{x\\to 0}-\\frac{x}{\\sin x}\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWe can make \\(|g(x)-M|\\) smaller than any fixed number by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\); unfortunately, \\(\\epsilon/(2f(x))\\) is not a fixed number, since \\(x\\) is a variable. Here we need another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing \\(x^{2}\\). We can find a \\(\\delta_{2}\\) so that \\(|x-a|<\\delta_{2}\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<1\\), meaning that \\(L-1<f(x)<L+1\\). This means that \\(|f(x)|<N\\), where \\(N\\) is either \\(|L-1|\\) or \\(|L+1|\\), depending on whether \\(L\\) is negative or positive. The important point is that \\(N\\) doesn't depend on \\(x\\). Finally, we know that there is a \\(\\delta_{3}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{3}\\) implies \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Now we're ready to put everything together. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the smallest of \\(\\delta_{1}\\), \\(\\delta_{2}\\), and \\(\\delta_{3}\\). Then \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), \\(|f(x)|<N\\), and \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&\\leq|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|\\cr&<N{\\epsilon\\over 2N}+ \\Big{|}{\\epsilon\\over 2M}\\Big{|}\\,|M|\\cr&={\\epsilon\\over 2}+{\\epsilon\\over 2}=\\epsilon.\\cr}\\]\nThis is just what we needed, so by the official definition, \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\nA handful of such theorems give us the tools to compute many limits without explicitly working with the definition of limit.\n**Theorem 2.3.6**.: Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\) and \\(k\\) is some constant. Then\n\\[\\eqalign{&\\lim_{x\\to a}kf(x)=k\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=kL\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}(f(x)+g(x))= \\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)+\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L+M\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}(f(x)-g(x))=\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)- \\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L-M\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\cdot\\lim_{x \\to a}g(x)=LM\\cr&\\lim_{x\\to a}{f(x)\\over g(x)}={\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\over\\lim_{x \\to a}g(x)}={L\\over M},\\hbox{ if }M\\hbox{ is not }0\\cr}\\]\nRoughly speaking, these rules say that to compute the limit of an algebraic expression, it is enough to compute the limits of the \"innermost bits\" and then combine these limits. This often means that it is possible to simply plug in a value for the variable, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}x=a\\).\n**Example 2.3.7**.: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}{x^{2}-3x+5\\over x-2}\\).

If the points are close together, the length of \\(\\Delta{\\bf r}\\) is close to the length of the curve between the two points. If we add up the lengths of many such tiny vectors, placed head to tail along a segment of the curve, we get an approximation to the length of the curve over that segment. In the limit, as usual, this sum turns into an integral that computes precisely the length of the curve. First, note that\n\\[|\\Delta{\\bf r}|=\\frac{|\\Delta{\\bf r}|}{\\Delta t}\\,\\Delta t\\approx|{\\bf r}^{ \\prime}(t)|\\,\\Delta t,\\]\nwhen \\(\\Delta t\\) is small.

A vector tangent to this path is given by the derivative \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(r)=\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\), and a small tangent vector, with length approximately equal to the side of the region, is \\(\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr\\). Likewise, if we fix \\(r=r_{0}=0.5\\), we get the vector function \\({\\bf w}(\\theta)=\\langle r_{0}\\cos\\theta,r_{0}\\sin\\theta,0\\rangle\\) with derivative \\({\\bf w}^{\\prime}(\\theta)=\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta,r_{0}\\cos\\theta,0\\rangle\\) and a small tangent vector \\(\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\) when \\(\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) (at the corner we're focusing on). These vectors are shown in figure 15.7.4, with the actual region outlined by a dotted boundary. Of course, since both \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly good approximation to the true area.\nThe area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta \\times\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr&=\\left|\\matrix{\\bf i &\\bf j&\\bf k\\cr-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0}&r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0}&0\\cr\\cos\\theta_{0}& \\sin\\theta_{0}&0\\cr}\\right|\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{0}-r_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr.}\\]\nThe length of this vector is \\(r_{0}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\).

In other words, \"\\(r\\)\" replaces the \"?\" in equation 15.7.2.\nIn general, a substitution will start with equations \\(x=f(u,v)\\) and \\(y=g(u,v)\\). Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\).

When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThis type of substitution is usually indicated when the function you wish to integrate contains a polynomial expression that might allow you to use the fundamental identity \\(\\sin^{2}x+\\cos^{2}x=1\\) in one of three forms:\n\\[\\cos^{2}x=1-\\sin^{2}x\\qquad\\sec^{2}x=1+\\tan^{2}x\\qquad\\tan^{2}x=\\sec^{2}x-1.\\]\nIf your function contains \\(1-x^{2}\\), as in the example above, try \\(x=\\sin u\\); if it contains \\(1+x^{2}\\) try \\(x=\\tan u\\); and if it contains \\(x^{2}-1\\), try \\(x=\\sec u\\).

Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=a\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle/a\\). Now \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\cos t,-a\\sin t,0\\rangle/a\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/a\\): the curvature of a circle is everywhere the reciprocal of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous example is \\(1/2\\); this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius \\(2\\), as shown in figure 13.3.1.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nmore or less quickly as time passes. The second derivative \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|\\) incorporates this notion of time, so it depends not simply on the geometric properties of the curve but on how quickly we move along the curve.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.5** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf s}(t)=\\langle\\cos 2t,\\sin 2t,0\\rangle\\). Both of these vector functions represent the unit circle in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, but if \\(t\\) is interpreted as time, the second describes an object moving twice as fast as the first. Computing the second derivatives, we find \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=1\\), \\(|{\\bf s}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=4\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nTo remove the dependence on time, we use the arc length parameterization. If a curve is given by \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), then the first derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit vector, that is, \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}(s)\\). We now compute the second derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)\\) and use \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)|\\) as the \"official\" measure of **curvature**, usually denoted \\(\\kappa\\).\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.6** We have seen that the arc length parameterization of a particular helix is \\({\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2}),\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2}),s/\\sqrt{2}\\rangle\\). Computing the second derivative gives \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)=\\langle-\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,-\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,0\\rangle\\) with length \\(1/2\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nWhat if we are given a curve as a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is not arc length? We have seen that arc length can be difficult to compute; fortunately, we do not need to convert to the arc length parameterization to compute curvature. Instead, let us imagine that we have done this, so we have found \\(t=g(s)\\) and then formed \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)={\\bf r}(g(s))\\). The first derivative \\(\\hat{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit tangent vector, so it is the same as the unit tangent vector \\({\\bf T}(t)={\\bf T}(g(s))\\). Taking the derivative of this we get\n\n\n",

What is the numeric of the double integral of the function f(x,y)=x*y^3 exp^{x^2+y^2} over I?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\). On the calculator, we graph \\(f(x)=2000\\) and \\(g(x)=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1x}\\) and find that they intersect at \\(x=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\approx-6.3093\\).\n3. We first note that we can rewrite the equation \\(9\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) as \\(3^{2}\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) to obtain \\(3^{x+2}=7^{2x}\\). Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other. We then divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which we obtain by factoring. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ x\\ln(3)+2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)-x\\ln(3)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&x(2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3))\\quad\\mbox{Factor}.\\\\ x&=&\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\end{array}\\] Graphing \\(f(x)=9\\cdot 3^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=7^{2x}\\) on the calculator, we see that these two graphs intersect at \\(x=\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\approx 0.7866\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n5. Rewriting \\(\\log(0.001)\\) as \\(\\log_{10}(0.001)\\), we see that we need to write \\(0.001\\) as a power of \\(10\\). We have \\(0.001=\\frac{1}{1000}=\\frac{1}{10^{3}}=10^{-3}\\). Hence, \\(\\log(0.001)=\\log\\left(10^{-3}\\right)=-3\\).\n6. We can use Theorem 6.2 directly to simplify \\(2^{\\log_{2}(8)}=8\\). We can also understand this problem by first finding \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\). By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(2\\) to get \\(8\\). Since \\(8=2^{3}\\), we have \\(\\log_{2}(8)=3\\). We now substitute to find \\(2^{\\log_{2}(8)}=2^{3}=8\\).\n7. From Theorem 6.2, we know \\(117^{\\log_{117}(6)}=6\\), but we cannot directly apply this formula to the expression \\(117^{-\\log_{117}(6)}\\). (Can you see why?) At this point, we use a property of exponents followed by Theorem 6.2 to get9 Footnote 9: It is worth a moment of your time to think your way through why \\(117^{\\log_{117}(6)}=6\\). By definition, \\(\\log_{117}(6)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(117\\) to get \\(6\\). What are we doing with this exponent? We are putting it on \\(117\\). By definition we get \\(6\\). In other words, the exponential function \\(f(x)=117^{x}\\) undoes the logarithmic function \\(g(x)=\\log_{117}(x)\\).\n\\[117^{-\\log_{117}(6)}=\\frac{1}{117^{\\log_{117}(6)}}=\\frac{1}{6}\\]\nUp until this point, restrictions on the domains of functions came from avoiding division by zero and keeping negative numbers from beneath even radicals. With the introduction of logs, we now have another restriction. Since the domain of \\(f(x)=\\log_{b}(x)\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), the argument10 of the log must be strictly positive. Footnote 10: See page 55 if you’ve forgotten what this term means.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nDouble sums like this come up in many applications, so in a way it is the most important part of this example; dividing by \\((b-a)(d-c)\\) is a simple extra step that allows the computation of an average. As we did in the single variable case, we introduce a special notation for the limit of such a double sum:\n\\[\\lim_{m,n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x \\Delta y=\\iint_{R}f(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy=\\iint_{R}f(x,y)\\,dA,\\]\nthe **double integral** of \\(f\\) over the region \\(R\\). The notation \\(dA\\) indicates a small bit of area, without specifying any particular order for the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\); it is shorter and\nFigure 15.1.1: A rectangular subdivision of \\([a,b]\\times[c,d]\\).\nmore \"generic\" than writing \\(dx\\,dy\\). The average height of the surface in this notation is\n\\[\\frac{1}{(b-a)(d-c)}\\iint_{R}f(x,y)\\,dA.\\]\nThe next question, of course, is: How do we compute these double integrals? You might think that we will need some two-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but as it turns out we can get away with just the single variable version, applied twice.\nGoing back to the double sum, we can rewrite it to emphasize a particular order in which we want to add the terms:\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x\\right)\\Delta y.\\]\nIn the sum in parentheses, only the value of \\(x_{j}\\) is changing; \\(y_{i}\\) is temporarily constant. As \\(m\\) goes to infinity, this sum has the right form to turn into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x=\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y_{i}) \\,dx.\\]\nSo after we take the limit as \\(m\\) goes to infinity, the sum is\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIn this section we will develop techniques for solving equations involving exponential functions. Suppose, for instance, we wanted to solve the equation \\(2^{x}=128\\). After a moment's calculation, we find \\(128=2^{7}\\), so we have \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\). The one-to-one property of exponential functions, detailed in Theorem 6.4, tells us that \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\) if and only if \\(x=7\\). This means that not only is \\(x=7\\) a solution to \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\), it is the _only_ solution. Now suppose we change the problem ever so slightly to \\(2^{x}=129\\). We could use one of the inverse properties of exponentials and logarithms listed in Theorem 6.3 to write \\(129=2^{\\log_{2}(129)}\\). We'd then have \\(2^{x}=2^{\\log_{2}(129)}\\), which means our solution is \\(x=\\log_{2}(129)\\). This makes sense because, after all, the definition of \\(\\log_{2}(129)\\) is 'the exponent we put on \\(2\\) to get \\(129\\).' Indeed we could have obtained this solution directly by rewriting the equation \\(2^{x}=129\\) in its logarithmic form \\(\\log_{2}(129)=x\\). Either way, in order to get a reasonable decimal approximation to this number, we'd use the change of base formula, Theorem 6.7, to give us something more calculator friendly,1 say \\(\\log_{2}(129)=\\frac{\\ln(129)}{\\ln(2)}\\). Another way to arrive at this answer is as follows\nFootnote 1: You can use natural logs or common logs. We choose natural logs. (In Calculus, you’ll learn these are the most ‘mathy’ of the logarithms.)\n\\[2^{x} = 129\\] \\[\\ln\\left(2^{x}\\right) = \\ln(129)\\] Take the natural log of both sides. \\[x\\ln(2) = \\ln(129)\\] Power Rule \\[x = \\frac{\\ln(129)}{\\ln(2)}\\]\nTaking the natural log' of both sides is akin to squaring both sides: since \\(f(x)=\\ln(x)\\) is a _function_, as long as two quantities are equal, their natural logs are equal.2 Also note that we treat \\(\\ln(2)\\) as any other non-zero real number and divide it through3 to isolate the variable \\(x\\). We summarize below the two common ways to solve exponential equations, motivated by our examples.\nFootnote 2: This is also the ‘if’ part of the statement \\(\\log_{b}(u)=\\log_{b}(w)\\) if and only if \\(u=w\\) in Theorem 6.4.\nFootnote 3: Please resist the temptation to divide both sides by ‘ln’ instead of \\(\\ln(2)\\). Just like it wouldn’t make sense to divide both sides by the square root symbol ‘\\(\\sqrt{\\cdot}\\)’ when solving \\(x\\sqrt{2}=5\\), it makes no sense to divide by ‘ln’.\n\n\n",

To graph \\(y=T(t)\\) using transformations, we start with the basic function, \\(f(t)=e^{t}\\). As we have already remarked, \\(e\\approx 2.718>1\\) so the graph of \\(f\\) is an increasing exponential with \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,1)\\) and horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\). The points \\(\\left(-1,e^{-1}\\right)\\approx(-1,0.37)\\) and \\((1,e)\\approx(1,2.72)\\) are also on the graph. Since the formula \\(T(t)\\) looks rather complicated, we rewrite \\(T(t)\\) in the form presented in Theorem 1.7 and use that result to track the changes to our three points and the horizontal asymptote. We have \\[T(t)=70+90e^{-0.1t}=90e^{-0.1t}+70=90f(-0.1t)+70\\] Multiplication of the input to \\(f\\), \\(t\\), by \\(-0.1\\) results in a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(10\\) as well as a reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. We divide each of the \\(x\\) values of our points by \\(-0.1\\) (which amounts to multiplying them by \\(-10\\)) to obtain \\(\\left(10,e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((-10,e)\\). Since none of these changes affected the \\(y\\) values, the horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we see that the output from \\(f\\) is being multiplied by \\(90\\). This results in a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(90\\). We multiply the \\(y\\)-coordinates by \\(90\\) to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,90)\\), and \\((-10,90e)\\). We also multiply the \\(y\\) value of the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) by \\(90\\), and it remains \\(y=0\\). Finally, we add \\(70\\) to all of the \\(y\\)-coordinates, which shifts the graph upwards to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}+70\\right)\\approx(10,103.11)\\), \\((0,160)\\), and \\((-10,90e+70)\\approx(-10,314.64)\\). Adding \\(70\\) to the horizontal asymptote shifts it upwards as well to \\(y=70\\). We connect these three points using the same shape in the same direction as in the graph of \\(f\\) and, last but not least, we restrict the domain to match the applied domain \\([0,\\infty)\\). The result is below.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe can write the chain rule in way that is somewhat closer to the single variable chain rule:\n\\[{df\\over dt}=\\langle f_{x},f_{y}\\rangle\\cdot\\langle x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}\\rangle,\\]\nor (roughly) the derivatives of the outside function \"times\" the derivatives of the inside functions. Not surprisingly, essentially the same chain rule works for functions of more than two variables, for example, given a function of three variables \\(f(x,y,z)\\), where each of \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) is a function of \\(t\\),\n\\[{df\\over dt}=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle\\cdot\\langle x^{\\prime},y^{ \\prime},z^{\\prime}\\rangle.\\]\nWe can even extend the idea further. Suppose that \\(f(x,y)\\) is a function and \\(x=g(s,t)\\) and \\(y=h(s,t)\\) are functions of two variables \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Then \\(f\\) is \"really\" a function of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) as well, and\n\\[{\\partial f\\over\\partial s}=f_{x}g_{s}+f_{y}h_{s}\\qquad{\\partial f\\over \\partial t}=f_{x}g_{t}+f_{y}h_{t}.\\]\nThe natural extension of this to \\(f(x,y,z)\\) works as well.\nRecall that we used the ordinary chain rule to do implicit differentiation. We can do the same with the new chain rule.\n**EXAMPLE 14.4.2**\\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) defines a sphere, which is not a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), though it can be thought of as two functions, the top and bottom hemispheres. We can think of \\(z\\) as one of these two functions, so really \\(z=z(x,y)\\), and we can think of\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nis a positive number, this induces only a horizontal scaling by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{B}\\). If \\(B<0\\), then we have a factor of \\(-1\\) in play, and dividing by it induces a reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. So we have \\(x=\\frac{a-H}{B}\\) as the input to \\(g\\) which corresponds to the input \\(x=a\\) to \\(f\\). We now evaluate \\(g\\left(\\frac{a-H}{B}\\right)=Af\\left(B\\cdot\\frac{a-H}{B}+H\\right)+K=Af(a)+K=Ab+K\\). We notice that the output from \\(f\\) is first multiplied by \\(A\\). As with the constant \\(B\\), if \\(A>0\\), this induces only a vertical scaling. If \\(A<0\\), then the \\(-1\\) induces a reflection across the \\(x\\)-axis. Finally, we add \\(K\\) to the result, which is our vertical shift. A less precise, but more intuitive way to paraphrase Theorem 1.7 is to think of the quantity \\(Bx+H\\) is the 'inside' of the function \\(f\\). What's happening inside \\(f\\) affects the inputs or \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\). To find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the corresponding points on \\(g\\), we undo what has been done to \\(x\\) in the same way we would solve an equation. What's happening to the output can be thought of as things happening 'outside' the function, \\(f\\). Things happening outside affect the outputs or \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\). Here, we follow the usual order of operations agreement: we first multiply by \\(A\\) then add \\(K\\) to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-coordinates on the graph of \\(g\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[y={1\\over 2}e^{\\sin 2}e^{-\\sin t}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\n#### Example 17.2.4\nSolve the initial value problem \\(t\\dot{y}+3y=0\\), \\(y(1)=2\\), assuming \\(t>0\\).

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSince \\(f_{x}=e^{z}\\), \\(f=xe^{z}+g(y,z)\\). Since \\(f_{y}=1\\), it must be that \\(g_{y}=1\\), so \\(g(y,z)=y+h(z)\\).

Green's Theorem says these are equal, or roughly, that the sum of the \"microscopic\" swirls over the region is the same as the \"macroscopic\" swirl around the boundary.\nNext, suppose that the boundary \\(\\partial D\\) has a vector form \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)\\) is tangent to the boundary, and \\({\\bf T}={\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)/|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\) is the usual unit tangent vector.

If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt} +R{dz\\over dt}\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+R\\left({\\partial z \\over\\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt.\\]\nusing the chain rule for \\(dz/dt\\). Now we continue to manipulate this:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+&R\\left({\\partial z\\over \\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt\\cr &=\\int_{a}^{b}\\left[\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right){dx\\over dt}+ \\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right){dy\\over dt}\\right]\\,dt\\cr&=\\int_{ \\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{\\partial z \\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy,}\\]\nwhich now looks just like the line integral of Green's Theorem, except that the functions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) of Green's Theorem have been replaced by the more complicated \\(P+R(\\partial z/\\partial x)\\) and \\(Q+R(\\partial z/\\partial y)\\). We can apply Green's Theorem to get\n\\[\\int_{\\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{ \\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}{\\partial \\over\\partial x}\\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)-{\\partial\\over \\partial y}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dA.\\]\nNow we can use the chain rule again to evaluate the derivatives inside this integral, and it becomes\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}&Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}+R_{z}g_{x}g_{ y}+Rg_{yx}-\\left(P_{y}+P_{z}g_{y}+R_{y}g_{x}+R_{z}g_{y}g_{x}+Rg_{xy}\\right)\\,dA\\cr&= \\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}-P_{y}-P_{z}g_{y}-R_{y}g_ {x}\\,dA,}\\]\nwhich is the same as the expression we obtained for the surface integral.\n### 16 Vector Calculus\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 16.9 The Divergence Theorem\nThe third version of Green's Theorem (equation 16.5.2) we saw was:\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,ds=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}\\, dA.\\]\nWith minor changes this turns into another equation, the Divergence Theorem:\n#### Divergence Theorem\nUnder suitable conditions, if \\(E\\) is a region of three dimensional space and \\(D\\) is its boundary surface, oriented outward, then\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\iiint\\limits_{E}\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}\\, dV.\\]\nProof.: Again this theorem is too difficult to prove here, but a special case is easier. In the proof of a special case of Green's Theorem, we needed to know that we could describe the region of integration in both possible orders, so that we could set up one double integral using \\(dx\\,dy\\) and another using \\(dy\\,dx\\). Similarly here, we need to be able to describe the three-dimensional region \\(E\\) in different ways.\nWe start by rewriting the triple integral:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}\\,dV=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}(P _{x}+Q_{y}+R_{z})\\,dV=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}P_{x}\\,dV+\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int \\limits_{E}Q_{y}\\,dV+\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}R_{z}\\,dV.\\]\nThe double integral may be rewritten:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D} (P{\\bf i}+Q{\\bf j}+R{\\bf k})\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}P{\\bf i }\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS+\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}Q{\\bf j}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS+\\int\\! \\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}R{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS.\\]\nTo prove that these give the same value it is sufficient to prove that\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}P{\\bf i}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}P_{x}\\,dV,\\] \\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}Q{\\bf j}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{y}\\,dV,\\;\\mbox{and}\\] (16.9.1) \\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}R{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}R_{z}\\,dV.\\]\nNot surprisingly, these are all pretty much the same; we'll do the first one.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThen the integral is transformed in a similar fashion:\n\\[\\int\\!\\int\\!\\int_{R}F(x,y,z)\\,dV=\\int\\!\\int\\!\\int_{S}F(f(u,v,w),g(u,v,w),h(u,v,w ))\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u,v,w)}\\right|\\,du\\,dv\\,dw,\\]\nwhere of course the region \\(S\\) in \\(uvw\\) space corresponds to the region \\(R\\) in \\(xyz\\) space.\nExercises 15.7.:\n1.

No matter what the number of rolls, once we simplify the average, we get the same \\(\\sum_{i=2}^{12}iP(i)\\). While the actual average value of a large number of rolls will not be exactly 7, the average should be close to 7 when the number of rolls is large. Turning this around, if the average is not close to 7, we should suspect that the dice are not fair.\nA variable, say \\(X\\), that can take certain values, each with a corresponding probability, is called a **random variable**; in the example above, the random variable was the sum of the two dice. If the possible values for \\(X\\) are \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),...,\\(x_{n}\\), then the expected value of the random variable is \\(E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}P(x_{i})\\). The expected value is also called the **mean**.\nWhen the number of possible values for \\(X\\) is finite, we say that \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable. In many applications of probability, the number of possible values of a random variable is very large, perhaps even infinite. To deal with the infinite case we need a different approach, and since there is a sum involved, it should not be wholly surprising that integration turns out to be a useful tool. It then turns out that even when the number of possibilities is large but finite, it is frequently easier to pretend that the number is infinite. Suppose, for example, that a dart is thrown at a dart board. Since the dart board consists of a finite number of atoms, there are in some sense only a finite number of places for the dart to land, but it is easier to explore the probabilities involved by pretending that the dart can land on any point in the usual \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nA variable, say \\(X\\), that can take certain values, each with a corresponding probability, is called a **random variable**; in the example above, the random variable was the sum of the two dice.

By using some techniques from multivariable calculus, it can be shown that \\(A=\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\).\n##### 9.8.5 The exponential distribution\nhas probability density function\n\\[f(x)=\\cases{0&$x<0$\\cr ce^{-cx}&$x\\geq 0$\\cr}\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is a positive constant.\nThe mean or expected value of a random variable is quite useful, as hinted at in our discussion of dice. Recall that the mean for a discrete random variable is \\(E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}P(x_{i})\\). In the more general context we use an integral in place of the sum.\n##### 9.8.6 The mean\nof a random variable \\(X\\) with probability density function \\(f\\) is \\(\\mu=E(X)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}xf(x)\\,dx\\), provided the integral converges.\nWhen the mean exists it is unique, since it is the result of an explicit calculation. The mean does not always exist.\nThe mean might look familiar; it is essentially identical to the center of mass of a one-dimensional beam, as discussed in section 9.6. The probability density function \\(f\\) plays the role of the physical density function, but now the \"beam\" has infinite length. If we consider only a finite portion of the beam, say between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the center of mass is\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[P(7)=6/36\\]\nHere we use \\(P(n)\\) to mean \"the probability of rolling an \\(n\\).\" Since we have correctly accounted for all possibilities, the sum of all these probabilities is \\(36/36=1\\); the probability that the sum is one of 2 through 12 is 1, because there are no other possibilities.\nThe study of probability is concerned with more difficult questions as well; for example, suppose the two dice are rolled many times. On the average, what sum will come up? In the language of probability, this average is called the **expected value** of the sum. This is at first a little misleading, as it does not tell us what to \"expect\" when the two dice are rolled, but what we expect the long term average will be.\nSuppose that two dice are rolled 36 million times. Based on the probabilities, we would expect about 1 million rolls to be 2, about 2 million to be 3, and so on, with a roll of 7 topping the list at about 6 million. The sum of all rolls would be 1 million times 2 plus 2 million times 3, and so on, and dividing by 36 million we would get the average:\n\\[\\bar{x} =(2\\cdot 10^{6}+3(2\\cdot 10^{6})+\\cdots+7(6\\cdot 10^{6})+\\cdots+1 2\\cdot 10^{6})\\frac{1}{36\\cdot 10^{6}}\\] \\[=2\\frac{10^{6}}{36\\cdot 10^{6}}+3\\frac{2\\cdot 10^{6}}{36\\cdot 10^{6 }}+\\cdots+7\\frac{6\\cdot 10^{6}}{36\\cdot 10^{6}}+\\cdots+12\\frac{10^{6}}{36\\cdot 10^{6}}\\] \\[=2P(2)+3P(3)+\\cdots+7P(7)+\\cdots+12P(12)\\] \\[=\\sum_{i=2}^{12}iP(i)=7.\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is a probability density function for a random variable \\(X\\), with mean \\(\\mu\\), we would like to measure how far a \"typical\" value of \\(X\\) is from \\(\\mu\\). One way to measure this distance is \\((X-\\mu)^{2}\\); we square the difference so as to measure all distances as positive. To get the typical such squared distance, we compute the mean. For two dice, for example, we get\n\\[(2-7)^{2}{1\\over 36}+(3-7)^{2}{2\\over 36}+\\cdots+(7-7)^{2}{6\\over 36}+\\cdots(11 -7)^{2}{2\\over 36}+(12-7)^{2}{1\\over 36}={35\\over 36}.\\]\nBecause we squared the differences this does not directly measure the typical distance we seek; if we take the square root of this we do get such a measure, \\(\\sqrt{35/36}\\approx 2.42\\). Doing the computation for the strange 11-sided die we get\n\\[(2-7)^{2}{1\\over 11}+(3-7)^{2}{1\\over 11}+\\cdots+(7-7)^{2}{1\\over 11}+\\cdots(11 -7)^{2}{1\\over 11}+(12-7)^{2}{1\\over 11}=10,\\]\nwith square root approximately 3.16. Comparing 2.42 to 3.16 tells us that the two-dice rolls clump somewhat more closely near 7 than the rolls of the weird die, which of course we already knew because these examples are quite simple.\nTo perform the same computation for a probability density function the sum is replaced by an integral, just as in the computation of the mean. The expected value of the squared distances is\n\\[V(X)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(x-\\mu)^{2}f(x)\\,dx,\\]\ncalled the **variance**. The square root of the variance is the **standard deviation**, denoted \\(\\sigma\\).\nWe compute the standard deviation of the standard normal distribution. The variance is\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}x^{2}e^{-x^{2}/2}\\,dx.\\]\n\n\n",

Suppose two different functions have the same derivative; what can you say about the relationship between the two functions?\n2. Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to another toll booth at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. What can be concluded about your actual speed during the trip? In particular, did you exceed the 65 mile per hour speed limit?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\nFigure 6.4.1: The linear approximation to \\(y=x^{2}\\).\nfunctions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.\n##### Example 6.4.2\nConsider the trigonometric function \\(\\sin x\\). Its linear approximation at \\(x=0\\) is simply \\(L(x)=x\\). When \\(x\\) is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.\n##### Definition 6.4.3\nLet \\(y=f(x)\\) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable \\(dx\\), and a new dependent variable \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\). Notice that \\(dy\\) is a function both of \\(x\\) (since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is a function of \\(x\\)) and of \\(dx\\). We say that \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are **differentials**.\n_Remark._ Up until now, \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) made sense only together, as \\(dy/dx\\), another way to write \\(f^{\\prime}\\). Now we have given them have individual meanings, but notice that since \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\), \\(dy/dx=f^{\\prime}(x)\\), so the new meanings are consistent with the former usage.\n\n\n",

To actually prove this analytically, we assume \\((x,y)\\) is a generic point on the graph of the equation. That is, we assume \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\) is true. As we learned in Section 1.1, the point symmetric to \\((x,y)\\) about the \\(y\\)-axis is \\((-x,y)\\). To show that the graph is\nsymmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis, we need to show that \\((-x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\), too. Substituting \\((-x,y)\\) into the equation gives\n\\[(-x)^{2}+(y)^{3} \\stackrel{{?}}{{=}} 1\\] \\[x^{2}+y^{3} \\stackrel{{\\vee}}{{=}} 1\\]\nSince we are assuming the original equation \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\) is true, we have shown that \\((-x,y)\\) satisfies the equation (since it leads to a true result) and hence is on the graph. In this way, we can check whether the graph of a given equation possesses any of the symmetries discussed in Section 1.1. We summarize the procedure in the following result.\n**Testing the Graph of an Equation for Symmetry**\nTo test the graph of an equation for symmetry\n* about the \\(y\\)-axis \\(\\,-\\,\\) substitute \\((-x,y)\\) into the equation and simplify. If the result is equivalent to the original equation, the graph is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nA second order differential equation is one containing the second derivative. These are in general quite complicated, but one fairly simple type is useful: the second order linear equation with constant coefficients.\n##### Example 17.5.1\nConsider the intial value problem \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-2y=0\\), \\(y(0)=5\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\). We make an inspired guess: might there be a solution of the form \\(e^{rt}\\)? This seems at least plausible, since in this case \\(\\ddot{y}\\), \\(\\dot{y}\\), and \\(y\\) all involve \\(e^{rt}\\).\n**470 Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nIf such a function is a solution then\n\\[\\eqalign{r^{2}e^{rt}-re^{rt}-2e^{rt}&=0\\cr e^{rt}(r^{2}-r-2)&=0\\cr(r^{2}-r-2)&=0 \\cr(r-2)(r+1)&=0,\\cr}\\]\nso \\(r\\) is \\(2\\) or \\(-1\\). Not only are \\(f=e^{2t}\\) and \\(g=e^{-t}\\) solutions, but notice that \\(y=Af+Bg\\) is also, for any constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{(Af+Bg)^{\\prime\\prime}-(Af+Bg)^{\\prime}-2(Af+Bg)&=Af^{\\prime\\prime}+ Bg^{\\prime\\prime}-Af^{\\prime}-Bg^{\\prime}-2Af-2Bg\\cr&=A(f^{\\prime\\prime}-f^{\\prime}-2f)+ B(g^{\\prime\\prime}-g^{\\prime}-2g)\\cr&=A(0)+B(0)=0.\\cr}\\]\nCan we find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that this is a solution to the initial value problem? Let's substitute:\n\\[5=y(0)=Af(0)+Bg(0)=Ae^{0}+Be^{0}=A+B\\]\nand\n\\[0=\\dot{y}(0)=Af^{\\prime}(0)+Bg^{\\prime}(0)=A2e^{0}+B(-1)e^{0}=2A-B.\\]\nSo we need to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that make both \\(5=A+B\\) and \\(0=2A-B\\) true. This is a simple set of simultaneous equations: solve \\(B=2A\\), substitute to get \\(5=A+2A=3A\\). Then \\(A=5/3\\) and \\(B=10/3\\), and the desired solution is \\((5/3)e^{2t}+(10/3)e^{-t}\\). You now see why the initial condition in this case included both \\(y(0)\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)\\): we needed two equations in the two unknowns \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nTo make use of the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, we need to be able to spot conservative vector fields \\({\\bf F}\\) and to compute \\(f\\) so that \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla f\\). Suppose that \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle=\\nabla f\\). Then \\(P=f_{x}\\) and \\(Q=f_{y}\\), and provided that \\(f\\) is sufficiently nice, we know from Clairaut's Theorem (14.6.2) that \\(P_{y}=f_{xy}=f_{yx}=Q_{x}\\). If we compute \\(P_{y}\\) and \\(Q_{x}\\) and find that they are not equal, then \\({\\bf F}\\) is not conservative. If \\(P_{y}=Q_{x}\\), then, again provided that \\({\\bf F}\\) is sufficiently nice, we can be assured that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative. Ultimately, what's important is that we be able to find \\(f\\); as this amounts to finding anti-derivatives, we may not always succeed.\n**EXAMPLE 16.3.3** Find an \\(f\\) so that \\(\\langle 3+2xy,x^{2}-3y^{2}\\rangle=\\nabla f\\).\nFirst, note that\n\\[{\\partial\\over\\partial y}(3+2xy)=2x\\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad{\\partial\\over \\partial x}(x^{2}-3y^{2})=2x,\\]\nso the desired \\(f\\) does exist. This means that \\(f_{x}=3+2xy\\), so that \\(f=3x+x^{2}y+g(y)\\); the first two terms are needed to get \\(3+2xy\\), and the \\(g(y)\\) could be any function of \\(y\\), as it would disappear upon taking a derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Likewise, since \\(f_{y}=x^{2}-3y^{2}\\), \\(f=x^{2}y-y^{3}+h(x)\\). The question now becomes, is it possible to find \\(g(y)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) so that\n\\[3x+x^{2}y+g(y)=x^{2}y-y^{3}+h(x),\\]\nand of course the answer is yes: \\(g(y)=-y^{3}\\), \\(h(x)=3x\\). Thus, \\(f=3x+x^{2}y-y^{3}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe can test a vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\) in a similar way. Suppose that \\(\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle\\). If we temporarily hold \\(z\\) constant, then \\(f(x,y,z)\\) is a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nand by Clairaut's Theorem \\(P_{y}=f_{xy}=f_{yx}=Q_{x}\\). Likewise, holding \\(y\\) constant implies \\(P_{z}=f_{xz}=f_{zx}=R_{x}\\), and with \\(x\\) constant we get \\(Q_{z}=f_{yz}=f_{zy}=R_{y}\\). Conversely, if we find that \\(P_{y}=Q_{x}\\), \\(P_{z}=R_{x}\\), and \\(Q_{z}=R_{y}\\) then \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative.\n#### Exercises 16.3\n* Find an \\(f\\) so that \\(\\nabla f=\\langle 2x+y^{2},2y+x^{2}\\rangle\\), or explain why there is no such \\(f\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find an \\(f\\) so that \\(\\nabla f=\\langle x^{3},-y^{4}\\rangle\\), or explain why there is no such \\(f\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[y^{\\prime}={1\\over e^{y}}={1\\over x}.\\]\nThere is one little difficulty here. To use the chain rule to compute \\(d/dx(e^{y})=y^{\\prime}e^{y}\\) we need to know that the function \\(y\\)_has_ a derivative. All we have shown is that _if_ it has a derivative then that derivative must be \\(1/x\\). When using this method we will always have to assume that the desired derivative exists, but fortunately this is a safe assumption for most such problems.\nThe example \\(y=\\ln x\\) involved an inverse function defined implicitly, but other functions can be defined implicitly, and sometimes a single equation can be used to implicitly define more than one function. Here's a familiar example. The equation \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) describes a circle of radius \\(r\\). The circle is not a function \\(y=f(x)\\) because for some values of \\(x\\) there are two corresponding values of \\(y\\). If we want to work with a function, we can break the circle into two pieces, the upper and lower semicircles, each of which is a function. Let's call these \\(y=U(x)\\) and \\(y=L(x)\\); in fact this is a fairly simple example, and it's possible to give explicit expressions for these: \\(U(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) and \\(L(x)=-\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) . But it's somewhat easier, and quite useful, to view both functions as given implicitly by \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\): both \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+U(x)^{2}\\) and \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+L(x)^{2}\\) are true, and we can think of \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) as defining both \\(U(x)\\) and \\(L(x)\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\sin(x^{2})=\\cos(x^{2})\\frac{d}{dx}x^{2}=2x\\cos(x^{2}),\\]\nso\n\\[\\int 2x\\cos(x^{2})\\,dx=\\sin(x^{2})+C.\\]\nEven when the chain rule has \"produced\" a certain derivative, it is not always easy to see. Consider this problem:\n\\[\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nThere are two factors in this expression, \\(x^{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), but it is not apparent that the chain rule is involved. Some clever rearrangement reveals that it is:\n\\[\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\int(-2x)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(1-(1-x^{2})) \\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nThis looks messy, but we do now have something that looks like the result of the chain rule: the function \\(1-x^{2}\\) has been substituted into \\(-(1/2)(1-x)\\sqrt{x}\\), and the derivative\nof \\(1-x^{2}\\), \\(-2x\\), multiplied on the outside. If we can find a function \\(F(x)\\) whose derivative is \\(-(1/2)(1-x)\\sqrt{x}\\) we'll be done, since then\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}F(1-x^{2})&=-2xF^{\\prime}(1-x^{2})&=(-2x)\\left(-{1\\over 2} \\right)(1-(1-x^{2}))\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\cr&=x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\cr}\\]\nBut this isn't hard:\n\\[\\eqalignno{\\int-{1\\over 2}(1-x)\\sqrt{x}\\,dx&=\\int-{1\\over 2}(x^{1/2}-x^{3/2}) \\,dx&(8.1.1)\\cr&=-{1\\over 2}\\left({2\\over 3}x^{3/2}-{2\\over 5}x^{5/2}\\right)+C\\cr&= \\left({1\\over 5}x-{1\\over 3}\\right)x^{3/2}+C.&\\cr}\\]\nSo finally we have\n\\[\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\left({1\\over 5}(1-x^{2})-{1\\over 3}\\right)(1-x^{ 2})^{3/2}+C.\\]\nSo we succeeded, but it required a clever first step, rewriting the original function so that it looked like the result of using the chain rule. Fortunately, there is a technique that makes such problems simpler, without requiring cleverness to rewrite a function in just the right way. It sometimes does not work, or may require more than one attempt, but the idea is simple: guess at the most likely candidate for the \"inside function\", then do some algebra to see what this requires the rest of the function to look like.\n\n\n",

Next, we determine the end behavior of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). Since the degree of the numerator is \\(1\\), and the degree of the denominator is \\(2\\), Theorem 4.2 tells us that \\(y=0\\) is the horizontal asymptote. As with the vertical asymptotes, we can glean more detailed information using 'number sense'. For the discussion below, we use the formula \\(f(x)=\\frac{3x}{x^{2}-4}\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\):_ If we were to make a table of values to discuss the behavior of \\(f\\) as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), we would substitute very 'large' negative numbers in for \\(x\\), say for example, \\(x=-1\\) billion.

Find them and give a rough sketch of \\(f\\) with its horizontal asymptotes. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. To find the \\(x\\)-intercept we set \\(y=g(x)=0\\). Using the factored form of \\(g(x)\\) above, we find the zeros to be the solutions of \\((2x-5)(x+1)=0\\). We obtain \\(x=\\frac{5}{2}\\) and \\(x=-1\\). Since both of these numbers are in the domain of \\(g\\), we have two \\(x\\)-intercepts, \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, we set \\(x=0\\) and find \\(y=g(0)=\\frac{5}{6}\\), so our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\).\n4. Since \\(g(x)\\) was given to us in lowest terms, we have, once again by Theorem 4.1 vertical asymptotes \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=3\\). Keeping in mind \\(g(x)=\\frac{(2x-5)(x+1)}{(x-3)(x+2)}\\), we proceed to our analysis near each of these values. * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(-9)(-1)}{(-5)(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\]\nso as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). On the flip side, as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to 3\\):_ As \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number just shy of \\(3\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(1)(4)}{(\\text{ very small }(-))(5)}\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{ very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] Hence, as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, we have (again, without labels on the \\(y\\)-axis) 5. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator of \\(g(x)\\) are the same, we know from Theorem 4.2 that we can find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of \\(g\\) by taking the ratio of the leading terms coefficients, \\(y=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\). However, if we take the time to do a more detailed analysis, we will be able to reveal some 'hidden' behavior which would be lost otherwise.11 As in the discussion following Theorem 4.2, we use the result of the long division \\(\\left(2x^{2}-3x-5\\right)\\div\\left(x^{2}-x-6\\right)\\) to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-3x-5}{x^{2}-x-6}\\) as \\(g(x)=2-\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}.\\) We focus our attention on the term \\(\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}\\). Footnote 11: That is, if you use a calculator to graph. Once again, Calculus is the ultimate graphing power tool.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n8. \\(f(x)=\\frac{4x}{x^{2}-4}=\\frac{4x}{(x+2)(x-2)}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,-2)\\cup(-2,2)\\cup(2,\\infty)\\) Vertical asymptotes: \\(x=-2,x=2\\) As \\(x\\to-2^{-},f(x)\\to-\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to-2^{+},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) No holes in the graph Horizontal asymptote: \\(y=0\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty,f(x)\\to 0^{-}\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty,f(x)\\to 0^{+}\\)\n9. \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-x-12}{x^{2}+x-6}=\\frac{x-4}{x-2}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,-3)\\cup(-3,2)\\cup(2,\\infty)\\) Vertical asymptote: \\(x=2\\) As \\(x\\to 2^{-},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to 2^{+},f(x)\\to-\\infty\\) Hole at \\((-3,\\frac{7}{5})\\) Horizontal asymptote: \\(y=1\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty,f(x)\\to 1^{+}\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty,f(x)\\to 1^{-}\\)\n10. \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+2x^{2}+x}{x^{2}-2}=\\frac{x(x+1)}{x-2}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,2)\\cup(2,\\infty)\\) Vertical asymptote: \\(x=2\\) As \\(x\\to 2^{-},f(x)\\to-\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to 2^{-},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to 2^{+},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) Slant asymptote: \\(y=x\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph is above \\(y=x\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the graph is below \\(y=x\\)\n11. \\(f(x)=\\frac{3x^{2}-5x-2}{x^{2}-9}=\\frac{(3x+1)(x-2)}{(x+3)(x-3)}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,-3)\\cup(-3,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\) Vertical asymptotes: \\(x=-3,x=3\\) As \\(x\\to-3^{-},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to-3^{+},f(x)\\to-\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to 3^{+},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) No holes in the graph Horizontal asymptote: \\(y=3\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty,f(x)\\to 3^{+}\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty,f(x)\\to 3^{-}\\)\n12. \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^{3}-3x+1}{x^{2}+1}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) No vertical asymptotes No holes in the graph Slant asymptote: \\(y=x\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph is above \\(y=x\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the graph is below \\(y=x\\)\n13. \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}+5x-3}{3x+2}\\) Domain: \\(\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cup\\left(-\\frac{2}{3},\\infty\\right)\\) Vertical asymptote: \\(x=-\\frac{2}{3}\\) As \\(x\\to-\\frac{2}{3}^{-},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) As \\(x\\to-\\frac{2}{3}^{+},f(x)\\to-\\infty\\) No holes in the graph Slant asymptote: \\(y=\\frac{2}{3}x+\\frac{11}{9}\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph is above \\(y=\\frac{2}{3}x+\\frac{11}{9}\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the graph is below \\(y=\\frac{2}{3}x+\\frac{11}{9}\\)\n15. \\(f(x)=\\frac{-5x^{4}-3x^{3}+x^{2}-10}{x^{3}-3x^{2}+3x-1}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\) Vertical asymptotes: \\(x=1\\) As \\(x\\to 1^{-},f(x)\\to\\infty\\) No holes in the graph Slant asymptote: \\(y=-x\\) As \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph is above \\(y=-x\\) As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the graph is below \\(y=-x\\)\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nFor the function $f(x)=|x|−1$ defined on $[-1,1]$. Does it meet the criteria of Rolle's Theorem? Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nHere we have replaced \\(a\\) by \\(t\\) in the first \\(N+1\\) terms of the Taylor series, and added a carefully chosen term on the end, with \\(B\\) to be determined. Note that we are temporarily keeping \\(x\\) fixed, so the only variable in this equation is \\(t\\), and we will be interested only in \\(t\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). Now substitute \\(t=a\\):\n\\[F(a)=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\,(x-a)^{n}+B(x-a)^{N+1}.\\]\nSet this equal to \\(f(x)\\):\n\\[f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\,(x-a)^{n}+B(x-a)^{N+1}.\\]\nSince \\(x\\neq a\\), we can solve this for \\(B\\), which is a \"constant\"--it depends on \\(x\\) and \\(a\\) but those are temporarily fixed. Now we have defined a function \\(F(t)\\) with the property that \\(F(a)=f(x)\\). Consider also \\(F(x)\\): all terms with a positive power of \\((x-t)\\) become zero when we substitute \\(x\\) for \\(t\\), so we are left with \\(F(x)=f^{(0)}(x)/0!=f(x)\\). So \\(F(t)\\) is a function with the same value on the endpoints of the interval \\([a,x]\\). By Rolle's theorem (6.5.1), we know that there is a value \\(z\\in(a,x)\\) such that \\(F^{\\prime}(z)=0\\). Let's look at \\(F^{\\prime}(t)\\). Each term in \\(F(t)\\), except the first term and the extra term involving \\(B\\), is a product, so to take the derivative we use the product rule on each of these terms. It will help to write out the first few terms of the definition:\n\\[F(t)=f(t) +\\frac{f^{(1)}(t)}{1!}(x-t)^{1}+\\frac{f^{(2)}(t)}{2!}(x-t)^{2}+ \\frac{f^{(3)}(t)}{3!}(x-t)^{3}+\\cdots\\] \\[+\\frac{f^{(N)}(t)}{N!}(x-t)^{N}+B(x-t)^{N+1}.\\]\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nNow take the derivative:\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIf we take a step back and look at the graphs of \\(g\\) and \\(f\\) in the last example, we notice that to obtain the graph of \\(f\\) from the graph of \\(g\\), we reflect a _portion_ of the graph of \\(g\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis. We can see this analytically by substituting \\(g(x)=x^{2}-x-6\\) into the formula for \\(f(x)\\) and calling to mind Theorem 1.4 from Section 1.7.\n\\[f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}-g(x),&\\mbox{if}&g(x)<0\\\\ g(x),&\\mbox{if}&g(x)\\geq 0\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nThe function \\(f\\) is defined so that when \\(g(x)\\) is negative (i.e., when its graph is below the \\(x\\)-axis), the graph of \\(f\\) is its refection across the \\(x\\)-axis. This is a general template to graph functions of the form \\(f(x)=|g(x)|\\). From this perspective, the graph of \\(f(x)=|x|\\) can be obtained by reflecting the portion of the line \\(g(x)=x\\) which is below the \\(x\\)-axis back above the \\(x\\)-axis creating the characteristic '\\(\\vee\\)' shape.\n#### Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 9, graph the quadratic function. Find the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts of each graph, if any exist. If it is given in general form, convert it into standard form; if it is given in standard form, convert it into general form. Find the domain and range of the function and list the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing. Identify the vertex and the axis of symmetry and determine whether the vertex yields a relative and absolute maximum or minimum.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcll}\\left(j\\circ j^{-1}\\right)(x)&=&j\\left(j^{-1}(x)\\right) \\\\ &=&j\\left(1-\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)\\\\ &=&\\left(1-\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)^{2}-2\\left(1-\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)+4\\\\ &=&1-2\\sqrt{x-3}+\\left(\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)^{2}-2+2\\sqrt{x-3}+4\\\\ &=&3+x-3\\\\ &=&x\\;\\diagup\\end{array}\\]\nUsing what we know from Section 1.7, we graph \\(y=j^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(y=j(x)\\) below.\n2. We graph \\(y=k(x)=\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\) using what we learned in Section 1.7 and see \\(k\\) is one-to-one.\nWe now try to find \\(k^{-1}\\).\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}y&=&k(x)\\\\ y&=&\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\\\ x&=&\\sqrt{y+2}-1\\\\ x+1&=&\\sqrt{y+2}\\\\ (x+1)^{2}&=&\\left(\\sqrt{y+2}\\right)^{2}\\\\ x^{2}+2x+1&=&y+2\\\\ y&=&x^{2}+2x-1\\end{array}\\]\nWe have \\(k^{-1}(x)=x^{2}+2x-1\\). Based on our experience, we know something isn't quite right. We determined \\(k^{-1}\\) is a quadratic function, and we have seen several times in this section that these are not one-to-one unless their domains are suitably restricted. Theorem 5.2 tells us that the domain of \\(k^{-1}\\) is the range of \\(k\\). From the graph of \\(k\\), we see that the range is \\([-1,\\infty)\\), which means we restrict the domain of \\(k^{-1}\\) to \\(x\\geq-1\\). We now check that this works in our compositions.\n\\[\\left(k^{-1}\\circ k\\right)\\left(x\\right) = k^{-1}(k(x))\\] \\[= k^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\right),\\ \\ x\\geq-2\\] \\[= \\left(\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\right)^{2}+2\\left(\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\right)-1\\] \\[= \\left(\\sqrt{x+2}\\right)^{2}-2\\sqrt{x+2}+1+2\\sqrt{x+2}-2-1\\] \\[= x+2-2\\] \\[= x\\ \\checkmark\\]\nand\n\\[\\left(k\\circ k^{-1}\\right)\\left(x\\right) = k\\left(x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\ \\ x\\geq-1\\] \\[= \\sqrt{(x^{2}+2x-1)+2}-1\\] \\[= \\sqrt{x^{2}+2x+1}-1\\] \\[= \\sqrt{(x+1)^{2}}-1\\] \\[= |x+1|-1\\] \\[= x+1-1\\] since\nGraphically, everything checks out as well, provided that we remember the domain restriction on \\(k^{-1}\\) means we take the right half of the parabola.\nOur last example of the section gives an application of inverse functions.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n75. In Section 1.1.1 we defined the set of **integers** as \\(\\mathbb{Z}=\\{\\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\}\\).14 The **greatest integer of \\(x\\)**, denoted by \\(\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\), is defined to be the largest integer \\(k\\) with \\(k\\leq x\\). 1. Find \\(\\lfloor 0.785\\rfloor\\), \\(\\lfloor 117\\rfloor\\), \\(\\lfloor-2.001\\rfloor\\), and \\(\\lfloor\\pi+6\\rfloor\\) 2. Discuss with your classmates how \\(\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\) may be described as a piecewise defined function. **HINT:** There are infinitely many pieces! 3. Is \\(\\lfloor a+b\\rfloor=\\lfloor a\\rfloor+\\lfloor b\\rfloor\\) always true? What if \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is an integer? Test some values, make a conjecture, and explain your result. Footnote 14: The use of the letter \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) for the integers is ostensibly because the German word _zahlen_ means ‘to count.’\n76. We have through our examples tried to convince you that, in general, \\(f(a+b)\\neq f(a)+f(b)\\). It has been our experience that students refuse to believe us so we'll try again with a different approach. With the help of your classmates, find a function \\(f\\) for which the following properties are always true. 1. \\(f(0)=f(-1+1)=f(-1)+f(1)\\)\n2. \\(f(5)=f(2+3)=f(2)+f(3)\\) 3. \\(f(-6)=f(0-6)=f(0)-f(6)\\) 4. \\(f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)\\) regardless of what two numbers we give you for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). How many functions did you find that failed to satisfy the conditions above? Did \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) work? What about \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) or \\(f(x)=3x+7\\) or \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{x}\\)? Did you find an attribute common to those functions that did succeed? You should have, because there is only one extremely special family of functions that actually works here. Thus we return to our previous statement, **in general**, \\(f(a+b)\\neq f(a)+f(b)\\).\n\n\n",

Suppose two regions have the same areas. What is the value $c$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nA computer program that plots such surfaces can be very useful, as it is often difficult to get a good idea of what they look like. Still, it is valuable to be able to visualize relatively simple surfaces without such aids. As in the previous example, it is often a good idea to examine the function on restricted subsets of the plane, especially lines. It can also be useful to identify those points \\((x,y)\\) that share a common \\(z\\)-value.\n**EXAMPLE 14.1.4** Consider \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\). When \\(x=0\\) this becomes \\(f=y^{2}\\), a parabola in the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane; when \\(y=0\\) we get the \"same\" parabola \\(f=x^{2}\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) plane. Now consider the line \\(y=kx\\). If we simply replace \\(y\\) by \\(kx\\) we get \\(f(x,y)=(1+k^{2})x^{2}\\) which is a parabola, but it does not really \"represent\" the cross-section along \\(y=kx\\), because the cross-section has the line \\(y=kx\\) where the horizontal axis should be. In\norder to pretend that this line is the horizontal axis, we need to write the function in terms of the distance from the origin, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\\sqrt{x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}}\\). Now \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}=(\\sqrt{x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}})^{2}\\). So the cross-section is the \"same\" parabola as in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) and \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) planes, namely, the height is always the distance from the origin squared. This means that \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) can be formed by starting with \\(z=x^{2}\\) and rotating this curve around the \\(z\\) axis.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOf course, this is the integral we actually computed above, but we have now arrived at it directly rather than as a modification of the difference between two other integrals. In that example it really doesn't matter which approach we take, but in some cases this second approach is better.\n### Area between curves\n**Example 9.1.2**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+1\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\); these are the same curves as before but lowered by 2. In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips below the \\(x\\)-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area by rectangles.

However, we have proven that is not the case.\n6. Testing the graph of \\(y=p(x)\\) for symmetry is complicated by the fact \\(p(x)\\) is a piecewise-defined function. As always, we handle this by checking the condition for symmetry by checking it on each piece of the domain. We first consider the case when \\(x<0\\) and set about finding the correct expression for \\(p(-x)\\). Even though \\(p(x)=x+3\\) for \\(x<0\\), \\(p(-x)\\neq-x+3\\) here. The reason for this is that since \\(x<0\\), \\(-x>0\\) which means to find \\(p(-x)\\), we need to use the _other_ formula for \\(p(x)\\), namely \\(p(x)=-x+3\\). Hence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(p(-x)=-(-x)+3=x+3=p(x)\\). For \\(x\\geq 0\\), \\(p(x)=-x+3\\) and we have two cases. If \\(x>0\\), then \\(-x<0\\) so \\(p(-x)=(-x)+3=-x+3=p(x)\\). If \\(x=0\\), then \\(p(0)=3=p(-0)\\). Hence, in all cases, \\(p(-x)=p(x)\\), so \\(p\\) is even. Since \\(p(0)=3\\) but \\(p(-0)=p(0)=3\\neq-3\\), we also have \\(p\\) is not odd. While graphing \\(y=p(x)\\) is not onerous to do by hand, it is instructive to see how to enter this into our calculator.

These are in general quite complicated, but one fairly simple type is useful: the second order linear equation with constant coefficients.\n##### Example 17.5.1\nConsider the intial value problem \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-2y=0\\), \\(y(0)=5\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\). We make an inspired guess: might there be a solution of the form \\(e^{rt}\\)? This seems at least plausible, since in this case \\(\\ddot{y}\\), \\(\\dot{y}\\), and \\(y\\) all involve \\(e^{rt}\\).\n**470 Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nIf such a function is a solution then\n\\[\\eqalign{r^{2}e^{rt}-re^{rt}-2e^{rt}&=0\\cr e^{rt}(r^{2}-r-2)&=0\\cr(r^{2}-r-2)&=0 \\cr(r-2)(r+1)&=0,\\cr}\\]\nso \\(r\\) is \\(2\\) or \\(-1\\). Not only are \\(f=e^{2t}\\) and \\(g=e^{-t}\\) solutions, but notice that \\(y=Af+Bg\\) is also, for any constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{(Af+Bg)^{\\prime\\prime}-(Af+Bg)^{\\prime}-2(Af+Bg)&=Af^{\\prime\\prime}+ Bg^{\\prime\\prime}-Af^{\\prime}-Bg^{\\prime}-2Af-2Bg\\cr&=A(f^{\\prime\\prime}-f^{\\prime}-2f)+ B(g^{\\prime\\prime}-g^{\\prime}-2g)\\cr&=A(0)+B(0)=0.\\cr}\\]\nCan we find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that this is a solution to the initial value problem? Let's substitute:\n\\[5=y(0)=Af(0)+Bg(0)=Ae^{0}+Be^{0}=A+B\\]\nand\n\\[0=\\dot{y}(0)=Af^{\\prime}(0)+Bg^{\\prime}(0)=A2e^{0}+B(-1)e^{0}=2A-B.\\]\nSo we need to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that make both \\(5=A+B\\) and \\(0=2A-B\\) true. This is a simple set of simultaneous equations: solve \\(B=2A\\), substitute to get \\(5=A+2A=3A\\). Then \\(A=5/3\\) and \\(B=10/3\\), and the desired solution is \\((5/3)e^{2t}+(10/3)e^{-t}\\).

(The unit circle is the graph of, well, the circle.) We can easily get a qualitatively correct idea of the graphs of the trigonometric functions from the unit circle diagram. Consider the sine function, \\(y=\\sin x\\). As \\(x\\) increases from \\(0\\) in the unit circle diagram, the second coordinate of the point \\(A\\) goes from \\(0\\) to a maximum of \\(1\\), then back to \\(0\\), then to a minimum of \\(-1\\), then back to \\(0\\), and then it obviously repeats itself. So the graph of \\(y=\\sin x\\) must look something like this:\nSimilarly, as angle \\(x\\) increases from \\(0\\) in the unit circle diagram, the first coordinate of the point \\(A\\) goes from \\(1\\) to \\(0\\) then to \\(-1\\), back to \\(0\\) and back to \\(1\\), so the graph of \\(y=\\cos x\\) must look something like this:\n#### Exercises 4.1.\nSome useful trigonometric identities are in appendix B.\n1.

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\n\n\n",

This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\).

To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\).

We compute the two integrals of the divergence theorem.\nThe triple integral is the easier of the two:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}2+3+2z\\,dx\\,dy\\,dz=6.\\]\nThe surface integral must be separated into six parts, one for each face of the cube.

We need a normal in the positive \\(y\\) direction, so we convert this to \\(\\langle 0,1,0\\rangle\\), and the corresponding integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}3y\\,du\\,dv=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}3\\,du\\,dv=3.\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nRecall that if \\(f\\) is a function, the gradient of \\(f\\) is given by\n\\[\\nabla f=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y },\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle.\\]\nA useful mnemonic for this (and for the divergence and curl, as it turns out) is to let\n\\[\\nabla=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle,\\]\nthat is, we pretend that \\(\\nabla\\) is a vector with rather odd looking entries. Recalling that \\(\\langle u,v,w\\rangle a=\\langle ua,va,wa\\rangle\\), we can then think of the gradient as\n\\[\\nabla f=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle f=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial f}{ \\partial x},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle,\\]\nthat is, we simply multiply the \\(f\\) into the vector.\nThe divergence and curl can now be defined in terms of this same odd vector \\(\\nabla\\) by using the cross product and dot product. The divergence of a vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle f,g,h\\rangle\\) is\n\\[\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial y},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\langle f,g,h\\rangle= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial h}{ \\partial z}.\\]\nThe curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\bf i}&{\\bf j}&{\\bf k}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial z}\\\\ f&g&h\\end{array}\\right|=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}-\\frac{ \\partial g}{\\partial z},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial h}{ \\partial x},\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right\\rangle.\\]\nHere are two simple but useful facts about divergence and curl.\n**Theorem 16.5.1**: \\(\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})=0\\)_._\nIn words, this says that the divergence of the curl is zero.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nBy repeated applications of Definition 5.1, we find \\((h\\circ(g\\circ f))(x)=h((g\\circ f)(x))=h(g(f(x)))\\). Similarly, \\(((h\\circ g)\\circ f)(x)=(h\\circ g)(f(x))=h(g(f(x)))\\). This establishes that the formulas for the two functions are the same. We leave it to the reader to think about why the domains of these two functions are identical, too. These two facts establish the equality \\(h\\circ(g\\circ f)=(h\\circ g)\\circ f\\). A consequence of the associativity of function composition is that there is no need for parentheses when we write \\(h\\circ g\\circ f\\). The second property can also be verified using Definition 5.1. Recall that the function \\(I(x)=x\\) is called the _identity function_ and was introduced in Exercise 73 in Section 2.1. If we compose the function \\(I\\) with a function \\(f\\), then we have \\((I\\circ f)(x)=I(f(x))=f(x)\\), and a similar computation shows \\((f\\circ I)(x)=f(x)\\). This establishes that we have an identity for function composition much in the same way the real number \\(1\\) is an identity for real number multiplication. That is, just as for any real number \\(x\\), \\(1\\cdot x=x\\cdot 1=x\\) , we have for any function \\(f\\), \\(I\\circ f=f\\circ I=f\\). We shall see the concept of an identity take on great significance in the next section. Out in the wild, function composition is often used to relate two quantities which may not be directly related, but have a variable in common, as illustrated in our next example.\n**Example 5.1.2**.: The surface area \\(S\\) of a sphere is a function of its radius \\(r\\) and is given by the formula \\(S(r)=4\\pi r^{2}\\). Suppose the sphere is being inflated so that the radius of the sphere is increasing according to the formula \\(r(t)=3t^{2}\\), where \\(t\\) is measured in seconds, \\(t\\geq 0\\), and \\(r\\) is measured in inches. Find and interpret \\((S\\circ r)(t)\\).\n**Solution.** If we look at the functions \\(S(r)\\) and \\(r(t)\\) individually, we see the former gives the surface area of a sphere of a given radius while the latter gives the radius at a given time. So, given a specific time, \\(t\\), we could find the radius at that time, \\(r(t)\\) and feed that into \\(S(r)\\) to find the surface area at that time. From this we see that the surface area \\(S\\) is ultimately a function of time \\(t\\) and we find \\((S\\circ r)(t)=S(r(t))=4\\pi(r(t))^{2}=4\\pi\\left(3t^{2}\\right)^{2}=36\\pi t^{4}\\). This formula allows us to compute the surface area directly given the time without going through the 'middle man' \\(r\\).\nA useful skill in Calculus is to be able to take a complicated function and break it down into a composition of easier functions which our last example illustrates.\n\n\n",

In the small village of Pedimaxus in the country of Sasquatchia, all 150 residents get one of the two local newspapers. Market research has shown that in any given week, 90% of those who subscribe to the Pedimaxus Tribune want to keep getting it, but 10% want to switch to the Sasquatchia Picayune. Of those who receive the Picayune, 80% want to continue with it and 20% want switch to the Tribune. We can express this situation using matrices. Specifically, let \\(X\\) be the 'state matrix' given by\n\\[X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}T\\\\ P\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of people who get the Tribune and \\(P\\) is the number of people who get the Picayune in a given week.

There is no way any environment can support infinitely many bacteria, so shortly before \\(t=5\\) the environment would collapse.\nNow that we have thoroughly investigated vertical asymptotes, we can turn our attention to horizontal asymptotes. The next theorem tells us when to expect horizontal asymptotes.\n**Theorem 4.2**.: **Location of Horizontal Asymptotes:** Suppose \\(r\\) is a rational function and \\(r(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are polynomial functions with leading coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), respectively.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Solution.** We begin with \\(N(t)=N_{0}e^{kt}\\). Since \\(N\\) is to give the number of cells _in thousands_, we have \\(N_{0}=12\\), so \\(N(t)=12e^{kt}\\). In order to complete the formula, we need to determine the\ngrowth rate \\(k\\). We know that after one week, the number of cells has grown to five million. Since \\(t\\) measures days and the units of \\(N\\) are in thousands, this translates mathematically to \\(N(7)=5000\\). We get the equation \\(12e^{7k}=5000\\) which gives \\(k=\\frac{1}{7}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1250}{3}\\right)\\). Hence, \\(N(t)=12e^{\\frac{t}{7}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1250}{3}\\right)}\\). Of course, in practice, we would approximate \\(k\\) to some desired accuracy, say \\(k\\approx 0.8618\\), which we can interpret as an \\(86.18\\%\\) daily growth rate for the cells.\nWhereas Equations 6.3 and 6.4 model the growth of quantities, we can use equations like them to describe the decline of quantities. One example we've seen already is Example 6.1.1 in Section 6.1. There, the value of a car declined from its purchase price of $25,000 to nothing at all. Another real world phenomenon which follows suit is radioactive decay. There are elements which are unstable and emit energy spontaneously. In doing so, the amount of the element itself diminishes. The assumption behind this model is that the rate of decay of an element at a particular time is directly proportional to the amount of the element present at that time. In other words, the more of the element there is, the faster the element decays. This is precisely the same kind of hypothesis which drives The Law of Uninhibited Growth, and as such, the equation governing radioactive decay is hauntingly similar to Equation 6.4 with the exception that the rate constant \\(k\\) is negative.\n\n\n",

(AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nLet's see how we can use this.\n6.2 Approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places.

As it turns out, we need to go to \\(n=12\\) to get two bounds that both round to the same value, which turns out to be 0.75. For comparison, using 12 rectangles to approximate the area gives 0.7727, which is considerably less accurate than the approximation using six trapezoids.\nIn practice it generally pays to start by requiring better than the maximum possible error; for example, we might have initially required \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\), or\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n6.2 Approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places.

For comparison, using 12 rectangles to approximate the area gives 0.7727, which is considerably less accurate than the approximation using six trapezoids.\nIn practice it generally pays to start by requiring better than the maximum possible error; for example, we might have initially required \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\), or\n\\[\\eqalign{{1\\over 12}(2){1\\over n^{2}}&<0.001\\cr{1\\over 6}(1000)&<n^{2}\\cr 12.91 \\approx\\sqrt{500\\over 3}&<n\\cr}\\]\nHad we immediately tried \\(n=13\\) this would have given us the desired answer. \\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThis is usually known as the **Trapezoid Rule**. For a modest number of subintervals this is not too difficult to do with a calculator; a computer can easily do many subintervals.\n**Figure 8.6.2** A single trapezoid.\nIn practice, an approximation is useful only if we know how accurate it is; for example, we might need a particular value accurate to three decimal places. When we compute a particular approximation to an integral, the error is the difference between the approximation and the true value of the integral. For any approximation technique, we need an **error estimate**, a value that is guaranteed to be larger than the actual error. If \\(A\\) is an approximation and \\(E\\) is the associated error estimate, then we know that the true value of the integral is between \\(A-E\\) and \\(A+E\\). In the case of our approximation of the integral, we want \\(E=E(\\Delta x)\\) to be a function of \\(\\Delta x\\) that gets small rapidly as \\(\\Delta x\\) gets small. Fortunately, for many functions, there is such an error estimate associated with the trapezoid approximation.\n**THEOREM 8.6.1** Suppose \\(f\\) has a second derivative \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval.

Then\n\\[\\int\\sqrt{\\sec^{2}u}\\sec^{2}u\\,du=\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du.\\]\nIn problems of this type, two integrals come up frequently: \\(\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du\\) and \\(\\int\\sec u\\,du\\). Both have relatively nice expressions but they are a bit tricky to discover.\n### Trigonometric Substitutions\nFirst we do \\(\\int\\sec u\\,du\\), which we will need to compute \\(\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du\\):\n\\[\\int\\sec u\\,du =\\int\\sec u\\,\\frac{\\sec u+\\tan u}{\\sec u+\\tan u}\\,du\\] \\[=\\int\\frac{\\sec^{2}u+\\sec u\\tan u}{\\sec u+\\tan u}\\,du.\\]\nNow let \\(w=\\sec u+\\tan u\\), \\(dw=\\sec u\\tan u+\\sec^{2}u\\,du\\), exactly the numerator of the function we are integrating. Thus\n\\[\\int\\sec u\\,du=\\int\\frac{\\sec^{2}u+\\sec u\\tan u}{\\sec u+\\tan u} \\,du =\\int\\frac{1}{w}\\,dw=\\ln|w|+C\\] \\[=\\ln|\\sec u+\\tan u|+C.\\]\nNow for \\(\\int\\sec^{3}u\\,du\\):\n\\[\\sec^{3}u =\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}=\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}+ \\frac{(\\tan^{2}u+1)\\sec u}{2}\\] \\[=\\frac{\\sec^{3}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec u\\tan^{2}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec u}{2}= \\frac{\\sec^{3}u+\\sec u\\tan^{2}u}{2}+\\frac{\\sec u}{2}.\\]\nWe already know how to integrate \\(\\sec u\\), so we just need the first quotient. This is \"simply\" a matter of recognizing the product rule in action:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSo we succeeded, but it required a clever first step, rewriting the original function so that it looked like the result of using the chain rule. Fortunately, there is a technique that makes such problems simpler, without requiring cleverness to rewrite a function in just the right way. It sometimes does not work, or may require more than one attempt, but the idea is simple: guess at the most likely candidate for the \"inside function\", then do some algebra to see what this requires the rest of the function to look like.\nOne frequently good guess is any complicated expression inside a square root, so we start by trying \\(u=1-x^{2}\\), using a new variable, \\(u\\), for convenience in the manipulations that follow. Now we know that the chain rule will multiply by the derivative of this inner function:\n\\[{du\\over dx}=-2x,\\]\nso we need to rewrite the original function to include this:\n\\[\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}=\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{u}{-2x\\over-2x}\\,dx=\\int{x^{2}\\over-2 }\\sqrt{u}\\,{du\\over dx}\\,dx.\\]\nRecall that one benefit of the Leibniz notation is that it often turns out that what looks like ordinary arithmetic gives the correct answer, even if something more complicated is\ngoing on. For example, in Leibniz notation the chain rule is\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{dy}{dt}\\frac{dt}{dx}.\\]\nThe same is true of our current expression:\n\n\n",

Moving all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}<2\\log_{2}(x)+3\\) to one side of the inequality, we have \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3<0\\). Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\), we get \\(\\log_{2}(x)=-1\\), which gives us \\(x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\log_{2}(x)=3\\), which yields \\(x=2^{3}=8\\). We use test values which are powers of \\(2\\): \\(0<\\frac{1}{4}<\\frac{1}{2}<1<8<16\\), and from our sign diagram, we see \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},8\\right)\\). Geometrically, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{2}\\) is below the graph of \\(y=g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\) on the solution interval.\n3.

We define \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x\\) and due to the presence of the logarithm, we require \\(x+1>0\\), or \\(x>-1\\). To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x=0\\). Factoring, we get \\(x\\left(\\log(x+1)-1\\right)=0\\), which gives \\(x=0\\) or \\(\\log(x+1)-1=0\\). The latter gives \\(\\log(x+1)=1\\), or \\(x+1=10^{1}\\), which admits \\(x=9\\). We select test values \\(x\\) so that \\(x+1\\) is a power of \\(10\\), and we obtain \\(-1<-0.9<0<\\sqrt{10}-1<9<99\\). Our sign diagram gives the solution to be \\((-1,0]\\cup[9,\\infty)\\).

As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\nWe can in fact turn this into a L'Hopital's Rule problem:\n\\[x\\ln x=\\frac{\\ln x}{1/x}=\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

Let \\(P(n)\\) be the sentence \\(3^{n}>n^{3}\\). Our base case is \\(n=4\\) and we check \\(3^{4}=81\\) and \\(4^{3}=64\\) so that \\(3^{4}>4^{3}\\) as required. We now assume \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is \\(3^{k}>k^{3}\\), and try to show \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. We note that \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}>3k^{3}\\) and so we are done if we can show \\(3k^{3}>(k+1)^{3}\\) for \\(k\\geq 4\\). We can solve the inequality \\(3x^{3}>(x+1)^{3}\\) using the techniques of Section 5.3, and doing so gives us \\(x>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3}-1}\\approx 2.26.\\) Hence, for \\(k\\geq 4\\), \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}>3k^{3}>(k+1)^{3}\\) so that \\(3^{k+1}>(k+1)^{3}\\). By induction, \\(3^{n}>n^{3}\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(n\\geq 4\\).\n6. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the sentence \\(\\log\\left(x^{n}\\right)=n\\log(x)\\). For the duration of this argument, we assume \\(x>0\\). The base case \\(P(1)\\) amounts checking that \\(\\log\\left(x^{1}\\right)=1\\log(x)\\) which is clearly true. Next we assume \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is \\(\\log\\left(x^{k}\\right)=k\\log(x)\\) and try to show \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Using the Product Rule for Logarithms along with the induction hypothesis, we get \\[\\log\\left(x^{k+1}\\right)=\\log\\left(x^{k}\\cdot x\\right)=\\log\\left(x^{k}\\right) +\\log(x)=k\\log(x)+\\log(x)=(k+1)\\log(x)\\] Hence, \\(\\log\\left(x^{k+1}\\right)=(k+1)\\log(x)\\). By induction \\(\\log\\left(x^{n}\\right)=n\\log(x)\\) is true for all \\(x>0\\) and all natural numbers \\(n\\geq 1\\).\n9. Let \\(A\\) be an \\(n\\times n\\) lower triangular matrix. We proceed to prove the \\(\\det(A)\\) is the product of the entries along the main diagonal by inducting on \\(n\\). For \\(n=1\\), \\(A=[a]\\) and \\(\\det(A)=a\\), so the result is (trivially) true. Next suppose the result is true for \\(k\\times k\\) lower triangular matrices. Let \\(A\\) be a \\((k+1)\\times(k+1)\\) lower triangular matrix. Expanding \\(\\det(A)\\) along the first row, we have \\[\\det(A)=\\sum_{p=1}^{n}a_{1p}C_{1p}\\] Since \\(a_{1p}=0\\) for \\(2\\leq p\\leq k+1\\), this simplifies \\(\\det(A)=a_{11}C_{11}\\). By definition, we know that \\(C_{11}=(-1)^{1+1}\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)=\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)\\) where \\(A_{11}\\) is \\(k\\times k\\) matrix obtained by deleting the first row and first column of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is lower triangular, so is \\(A_{11}\\) and, as such, the induction hypothesis applies to \\(A_{11}\\). In other words, \\(\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)\\) is the product of the entries along \\(A_{11}\\)'s main diagonal. Now, the entries on the main diagonal of \\(A_{11}\\) are the entries \\(a_{22}\\), \\(a_{33}\\), ..., \\(a_{(k+1)(k+1)}\\) from the main diagonal of \\(A\\). Hence, \\[\\det(A)=a_{11}\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)=a_{11}\\left(a_{22}a_{33}\\cdots a_{(k+1) (k+1)}\\right)=a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}\\cdots a_{(k+1)(k+1)}\\] We have \\(\\det(A)\\) is the product of the entries along its main diagonal. This shows \\(P(k+1)\\) is true, and, hence, by induction, the result holds for all \\(n\\times n\\) upper triangular matrices. The \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix \\(I_{n}\\) is a lower triangular matrix whose main diagonal consists of all 1's. Hence, \\(\\det\\left(I_{n}\\right)=1\\), as required.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n6. We can use Theorem 6.2 directly to simplify \\(2^{\\log_{2}(8)}=8\\). We can also understand this problem by first finding \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\). By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(2\\) to get \\(8\\). Since \\(8=2^{3}\\), we have \\(\\log_{2}(8)=3\\). We now substitute to find \\(2^{\\log_{2}(8)}=2^{3}=8\\).\n7. From Theorem 6.2, we know \\(117^{\\log_{117}(6)}=6\\), but we cannot directly apply this formula to the expression \\(117^{-\\log_{117}(6)}\\). (Can you see why?) At this point, we use a property of exponents followed by Theorem 6.2 to get9 Footnote 9: It is worth a moment of your time to think your way through why \\(117^{\\log_{117}(6)}=6\\). By definition, \\(\\log_{117}(6)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(117\\) to get \\(6\\). What are we doing with this exponent? We are putting it on \\(117\\). By definition we get \\(6\\). In other words, the exponential function \\(f(x)=117^{x}\\) undoes the logarithmic function \\(g(x)=\\log_{117}(x)\\).\n\\[117^{-\\log_{117}(6)}=\\frac{1}{117^{\\log_{117}(6)}}=\\frac{1}{6}\\]\nUp until this point, restrictions on the domains of functions came from avoiding division by zero and keeping negative numbers from beneath even radicals.

What is \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like \"the limit of \\((-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2})/\\Delta x\\) as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to zero is \\(-19.6\\),\" and abbreviate this mouthful\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nUsually \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the left\" and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the right\".\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.13**  Discuss \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\).\nThe function \\(f(x)=x/|x|\\) is undefined at 0; when \\(x>0\\), \\(|x|=x\\) and so \\(f(x)=1\\); when \\(x<0\\), \\(|x|=-x\\) and \\(f(x)=-1\\). Thus \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}-1=-1\\) while\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}1=1\\). The limit of \\(f(x)\\) must be equal to both the left and right limits; since they are different, the limit \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\) does not exist. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 2.3.\nCompute the limits.

It seems clear that as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger, \\(1/x\\) gets closer and closer to zero, so \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) should be getting closer and closer to \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)__\nAs with ordinary limits, these concepts can be made precise. Roughly, we want \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) to mean that we can make \\(f(x)\\) arbitrarily large by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) should mean we can make \\(f(x)\\) as close as we want to \\(L\\) by making \\(x\\) large enough.

If the value of an improper integral is a finite number, as in this example, we say that the integral **converges**, and if not we say that the integral **diverges**.\nHere's another way, perhaps even more surprising, to interpret this calculation. We know that one interpretation of\n\\[\\int_{1}^{D}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx\\]\nis the area under \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) from \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=D\\). Of course, as \\(D\\) increases this area increases. But since\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x^{2}-3x+7}{x^{2}+47x+1}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{4x-3}{ 2x+47}.\\]\nIn the second quotient, it is still the case that the numerator and denominator both go to infinity, so we are allowed to use L'Hopital's Rule again:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{4x-3}{2x+47}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{4}{2}=2.\\]\nSo the original limit is 2 as well.\nAgain, we don't really need L'Hopital's Rule, and in fact a more elementary approach is easier--we divide the numerator and denominator by \\(x^{2}\\):\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x^{2}-3x+7}{x^{2}+47x+1}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2x^{2 }-3x+7}{x^{2}+47x+1}\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{2-\\frac{3}{x}+ \\frac{7}{x^{2}}}{1+\\frac{47}{x}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches infinity, all the quotients with some power of \\(x\\) in the denominator approach zero, leaving 2 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator, so the limit again is\n**Example 4.10.8**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}\\).\nBoth the numerator and denominator approach zero, so applying L'Hopital's Rule:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}=\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x\\tan x}{\\cos x}= \\frac{1\\cdot 0}{1}=0.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 4.10.9**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}x\\ln x\\).\nThis doesn't appear to be suitable for L'Hopital's Rule, but it also is not \"obvious\". As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFigure 15.1.1: A rectangular subdivision of \\([a,b]\\times[c,d]\\).\nmore \"generic\" than writing \\(dx\\,dy\\). The average height of the surface in this notation is\n\\[\\frac{1}{(b-a)(d-c)}\\iint_{R}f(x,y)\\,dA.\\]\nThe next question, of course, is: How do we compute these double integrals? You might think that we will need some two-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but as it turns out we can get away with just the single variable version, applied twice.\nGoing back to the double sum, we can rewrite it to emphasize a particular order in which we want to add the terms:\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x\\right)\\Delta y.\\]\nIn the sum in parentheses, only the value of \\(x_{j}\\) is changing; \\(y_{i}\\) is temporarily constant. As \\(m\\) goes to infinity, this sum has the right form to turn into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x=\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y_{i}) \\,dx.\\]\nSo after we take the limit as \\(m\\) goes to infinity, the sum is\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y_{i})\\,dx\\right)\\Delta y.\\]\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface.\n### Chapter 15 Multiple Integration\nOf course, for different values of \\(y_{i}\\) this integral has different values; in other words, it is really a function applied to \\(y_{i}\\):\n\\[G(y)=\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y)\\,dx.\\]\nIf we substitute back into the sum we get\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}G(y_{i})\\Delta y.\\]\nThis sum has a nice interpretation. The value \\(G(y_{i})\\) is the area of a cross section of the region under the surface \\(f(x,y)\\), namely, when \\(y=y_{i}\\). The quantity \\(G(y_{i})\\Delta y\\) can be interpreted as the volume of a solid with face area \\(G(y_{i})\\) and thickness \\(\\Delta y\\). Think of the surface \\(f(x,y)\\) as the top of a loaf of sliced bread. Each slice has a cross-sectional area and a thickness; \\(G(y_{i})\\Delta y\\) corresponds to the volume of a single slice of bread. Adding these up approximates the total volume of the loaf. (This is very similar to the technique we used to compute volumes in section 9.3, except that there we need the cross-sections to be in some way \"the same\".) Figure 15.1.3 shows this \"sliced loaf\" approximation using the same surface as shown in figure 15.1.2. Nicely enough, this sum looks just like the sort of sum that turns into an integral, namely,\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nRecall that if the curve is given by the vector function \\({\\bf r}\\) then the vector \\(\\Delta{\\bf r}={\\bf r}(t+\\Delta t)-{\\bf r}(t)\\) points from one position on the curve to another, as depicted in figure 13.2.1. If the points are close together, the length of \\(\\Delta{\\bf r}\\) is close to the length of the curve between the two points. If we add up the lengths of many such tiny vectors, placed head to tail along a segment of the curve, we get an approximation to the length of the curve over that segment. In the limit, as usual, this sum turns into an integral that computes precisely the length of the curve. First, note that\n\\[|\\Delta{\\bf r}|=\\frac{|\\Delta{\\bf r}|}{\\Delta t}\\,\\Delta t\\approx|{\\bf r}^{ \\prime}(t)|\\,\\Delta t,\\]\nwhen \\(\\Delta t\\) is small. Then the length of the curve between \\({\\bf r}(a)\\) and \\({\\bf r}(b)\\) is\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|\\Delta{\\bf r}|=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^ {n-1}\\frac{|\\Delta{\\bf r}|}{\\Delta t}\\,\\Delta t=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{ n-1}|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\,\\Delta t=\\int_{a}^{b}|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\,dt.\\]\n(Well, sometimes. This works if between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) the segment of curve is traced out exactly once.)\n##### Example 13.3.1\nLet's find the length of one turn of the helix \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\) (see figure 13.1.1).

Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**8.** Find the derivative of \\(y=f(x)=2/\\sqrt{2x+1}\\Rightarrow\\)\n**9.** Find the derivative of \\(y=g(t)=(2t-1)/(t+2)\\Rightarrow\\)\n**10.** Find an equation for the tangent line to the graph of \\(f(x)=5-x-3x^{2}\\) at the point \\(x=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**11.** Find a value for \\(a\\) so that the graph of \\(f(x)=x^{2}+ax-3\\) has a horizontal tangent line at \\(x=4\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n### 2.5 Properties of Functions\nAs we have defined it in Section 1.3, a function is a very general object. At this point, it is useful to introduce a collection of properties of functions; knowing that a function has one of these properties can be very useful. Consider the graphs of the functions in Figure 2.5.1. It would clearly be useful to have words to help us describe the distinct features of each of them. We will point out and define a few properties (there are many more) of the functions pictured here. For the sake of the discussion, we will assume that the graphs do not exhibit any unusual behavior off-stage (i.e., outside the view of the graphs).\n**Functions.** Each graph in Figure 2.5.1 certainly represents a function--since each passes the _vertical line test_. In other words, as you sweep a vertical line across the graph of each function, the line never intersects the graph more than once. If it did, then the graph would not represent a function.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n2. For the system \\(\\left\\{x=2e^{-t},\\,y=e^{-2t}\\,\\right.\\) for \\(t\\geq 0\\), we proceed as in the previous example and graph \\(x=2e^{-t}\\) and \\(y=e^{-2t}\\) over the interval \\([0,\\infty)\\). We find that the range of \\(x\\) in this case is \\((0,2]\\) and the range of \\(y\\) is \\((0,1]\\). Next, we plug in some friendly values of \\(t\\) to get a sense of the orientation of the curve. Since \\(t\\) lies in the exponent here, 'friendly' values of \\(t\\) involve natural logarithms. Starting with \\(t=\\ln(1)=0\\) we get5\\((2,1)\\), for \\(t=\\ln(2)\\) we get \\(\\left(1,\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\) and for \\(t=\\ln(3)\\) we get \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\). Since \\(t\\) is ranging over the unbounded interval \\([0,\\infty)\\), we take the time to analyze the end behavior of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). As \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(x=2e^{-t}\\to 0^{+}\\) and \\(y=e^{-2t}\\to 0^{+}\\) as well. This means the graph of \\(\\left\\{x=2e^{-t},\\,y=e^{-2t}\\,\\right.\\) approaches the point \\((0,0)\\). Since both \\(x=2e^{-t}\\) and \\(y=e^{-2t}\\) are always decreasing for \\(t\\geq 0\\), we know that our final graph will start at \\((2,1)\\) (where \\(t=0\\)), and move consistently to the left (since \\(x\\) is decreasing) and down (since \\(y\\) is decreasing) to approach the origin. To eliminate the parameter, one way to proceed is to solve \\(x=2e^{-t}\\) for \\(t\\) to get \\(t=-\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\). Substituting this for \\(t\\) in \\(y=e^{-2t}\\) gives \\(y=e^{-2(-\\ln(x/2))}=e^{2\\ln(x/2)}=e^{\\ln(x/2)^{2}}=\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2 }=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\). Or, we could recognize that \\(y=e^{-2t}=\\left(e^{-t}\\right)^{2}\\), and since \\(x=2e^{-t}\\) means \\(e^{-t}=\\frac{x}{2}\\), we get \\(y=\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\) this way as well. Either way, the graph of \\(\\left\\{x=2e^{-t},\\,y=e^{-2t}\\,\\right.\\) for \\(t\\geq 0\\) is a portion of the parabola \\(y=\\frac{x^{2}}{4}\\) which starts at the point \\((2,1)\\) and heads towards, but never reaches,6\\((0,0)\\). Footnote 5: The reader is encouraged to review Sections 6.1 and 6.2 as needed. Footnote 6: Note the open circle at the origin. See the solution to part 3 in Example 1.2.1 on page 22 and Theorem 4.1 in Section 4.1 for a review of this concept.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThe potential difficulty is largely due to the fact that there are many ways to \"approach\" a point in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. If we want to say that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\), we need to capture the idea that as \\((x,y)\\) gets close to \\((a,b)\\) then \\(f(x,y)\\) gets close to \\(L\\). For functions of one variable, \\(f(x)\\), there are only two ways that \\(x\\) can approach \\(a\\): from the left or right. But there are an infinite number of ways to approach \\((a,b)\\): along any one of an infinite number of lines, or an infinite number of parabolas, or an infinite number of sine curves, and so on. We might hope that it's really not so bad--suppose, for example, that along every possible line through \\((a,b)\\) the value of \\(f(x,y)\\) gets close to \\(L\\); surely this means that \"\\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(L\\) as \\((x,y)\\) approaches \\((a,b)\\)\". Sadly, no.\n**EXAMPLE 14.2.1** Consider \\(f(x,y)=xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\). When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well. So along every line through the origin \\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(0\\). Now suppose we approach the origin along \\(x=y^{2}\\). Then\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSometimes one encounters a point in the domain of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) where there is _no derivative_, because there is no tangent line. In order for the notion of the tangent line at a point to make sense, the curve must be \"smooth\" at that point. This means that if you imagine a particle traveling at some steady speed along the curve, then the particle does not experience an abrupt change of direction. There are two types of situations you should be aware of--corners and cusps--where there's a sudden change of direction and hence no derivative.\n##### Example 2.4.4\nDiscuss the derivative of the absolute value function \\(y=f(x)=|x|\\).\nIf \\(x\\) is positive, then this is the function \\(y=x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(1\\). (Recall that when \\(y=f(x)=mx+b\\), the derivative is the slope \\(m\\).) If \\(x\\) is negative, then we're dealing with the function \\(y=-x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(-1\\). If \\(x=0\\), then the function has a corner, i.e., there is no tangent line. A tangent line would have to point in the direction of the curve--but there are _two_ directions of the curve that come together at the origin. We can summarize this as\n\\[y^{\\prime}=\\cases{1&if $x>0$;\\cr-1&if $x<0$;\\cr\\hbox{undefined}&if $x=0$.}\\]\n##### Example 2.4.5\n\n\n",

For a modest number of subintervals this is not too difficult to do with a calculator; a computer can easily do many subintervals.\n**Figure 8.6.2** A single trapezoid.\nIn practice, an approximation is useful only if we know how accurate it is; for example, we might need a particular value accurate to three decimal places. When we compute a particular approximation to an integral, the error is the difference between the approximation and the true value of the integral. For any approximation technique, we need an **error estimate**, a value that is guaranteed to be larger than the actual error. If \\(A\\) is an approximation and \\(E\\) is the associated error estimate, then we know that the true value of the integral is between \\(A-E\\) and \\(A+E\\). In the case of our approximation of the integral, we want \\(E=E(\\Delta x)\\) to be a function of \\(\\Delta x\\) that gets small rapidly as \\(\\Delta x\\) gets small. Fortunately, for many functions, there is such an error estimate associated with the trapezoid approximation.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 9.1 Area between Curves\nWe have seen how integration can be used to find an area between a curve and the \\(x\\)-axis. With very little change we can find some areas between curves; indeed, the area between a curve and the \\(x\\)-axis may be interpreted as the area between the curve and a second \"curve\" with equation \\(y=0\\). In the simplest of cases, the idea is quite easy to understand.\n**Example 9.1.1**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+3\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+5\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\). In figure 9.1.1 we show the two curves together, with the desired area shaded, then \\(f\\) alone with the area under \\(f\\) shaded, and then \\(g\\) alone with the area under \\(g\\) shaded.\nFigure 9.1.1: Area between curves as a difference of areas.\n### Chapter 9 Applications of Integration\nIt is clear from the figure that the area we want is the area under \\(f\\) minus the area under \\(g\\), which is to say\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)\\,dx-\\int_{1}^{2}g(x)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx.\\]\nIt doesn't matter whether we compute the two integrals on the left and then subtract or compute the single integral on the right. In this case, the latter is perhaps a bit easier:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx&=\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+3-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+ 5)\\,dx\\cr&=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x-2\\,dx\\cr&=\\left.{x^{4}\\over 4}-{8x^{3} \\over 3}+7x^{2}-2x\\right|_{1}^{2}\\cr&={16\\over 4}-{64\\over 3}+28-4-({1\\over 4}-{8 \\over 3}+7-2)\\cr&=23-{56\\over 3}-{1\\over 4}={49\\over 12}.\\cr}\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIn the limit, as \\(n\\) gets larger, this gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}\\) and the approximated position of the object gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), so the actual position is \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), exactly the answer given by the first approach to the problem. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 7.1.2** Find the area under the curve \\(y=3x\\) between \\(x=0\\) and any positive value \\(x\\). There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,\nbut the second approach works fine. (Because the function \\(y=3x\\) is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and \\(x\\) into \\(n\\) equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let's use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1. The height of rectangle number \\(i\\) is then \\(3(i-1)(x/n)\\), the width is \\(x/n\\), and the area is \\(3(i-1)(x^{2}/n^{2})\\). The total area of the rectangles is\n\\[(0)\\frac{x}{n}+3(1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(2)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(3)\\frac{x^{2} }{n^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}.\\]\n\n\n",

Not surprisingly, non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more general equations.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) is a function of two variables.

Under suitable conditions on the function \\(\\phi\\), it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable property.\n##### Example 17.4.1\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\) is a first order non-linear equation, because \\(y\\) appears to the second power.

There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,\nbut the second approach works fine. (Because the function \\(y=3x\\) is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and \\(x\\) into \\(n\\) equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let's use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1. The height of rectangle number \\(i\\) is then \\(3(i-1)(x/n)\\), the width is \\(x/n\\), and the area is \\(3(i-1)(x^{2}/n^{2})\\). The total area of the rectangles is\n\\[(0)\\frac{x}{n}+3(1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(2)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(3)\\frac{x^{2} }{n^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}.\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx.\\]\nOf course, this is the integral we actually computed above, but we have now arrived at it directly rather than as a modification of the difference between two other integrals. In that example it really doesn't matter which approach we take, but in some cases this second approach is better.\n### Area between curves\n**Example 9.1.2**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+1\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\); these are the same curves as before but lowered by 2. In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips below the \\(x\\)-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area by rectangles. The height of a typical rectangle will still be \\(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i})\\), even if \\(g(x_{i})\\) is negative. Thus the area is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+1-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x -2\\,dx.\\]\nThis is of course the same integral as before, because the region between the curves is identical to the former region--it has just been moved down by 2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 9.1.3**: Find the area between \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}-6x+5\\) over the interval \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\); the curves are shown in figure 9.1.4. Generally we should interpret\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nLet's see how we can use this.\n6.2 Approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The second derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((4x^{2}-2)e^{-x^{2}}\\), and it is not hard to see that on \\([0,1]\\), \\(|(4x^{2}-2)e^{-x^{2}}|\\leq 2\\). We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\) or\n\\[\\eqalign{{1\\over 12}(2){1\\over n^{2}}&<0.005\\cr{1\\over 6}(200)&<n^{2}\\cr 5.77 \\approx\\sqrt{100\\over 3}&<n\\cr}\\]\nWith \\(n=6\\), the error estimate is thus \\(1/6^{3}<0.0047\\). We compute the trapezoid approximation for six intervals:\n\\[\\left({f(0)\\over 2}+f(1/6)+f(2/6)+\\cdots+f(5/6)+{f(1)\\over 2}\\right){1\\over 6 }\\approx 0.74512.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.74512-0.0047=0.74042\\) and \\(0.74512+0.0047=0.74982\\). Unfortunately, the first rounds to 0.74 and the second rounds to 0.75, so we can't be sure of the correct value in the second decimal place; we need to pick a larger \\(n\\). As it turns out, we need to go to \\(n=12\\) to get two bounds that both round to the same value, which turns out to be 0.75. For comparison, using 12 rectangles to approximate the area gives 0.7727, which is considerably less accurate than the approximation using six trapezoids.\nIn practice it generally pays to start by requiring better than the maximum possible error; for example, we might have initially required \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\), or\n\n\n",

In some cases we can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\nAgain we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know. So we look at \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\):\n\\[{a_{n+1}\\over a_{n}}={(n+1)!\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}{n^{n}\\over n!}={(n+1)!\\over n!} {n^{n}\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}={n+1\\over n+1}\\left({n\\over n+1}\\right)^{n}=\\left({n \\over n+1}\\right)^{n}<1.\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIn this series the sizes of the terms decrease, that is, \\(|a_{n}|\\) forms a decreasing sequence, but this is not required in an alternating series. As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.\n**THEOREM 11.4.1** Suppose that \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\). Then the alternating series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\) converges.\n_Proof._ The odd numbered partial sums, \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a non-increasing sequence, because \\(s_{2k+3}=s_{2k+1}-a_{2k+2}+a_{2k+3}\\leq s_{2k+1}\\), since \\(a_{2k+2}\\geq a_{2k+3}\\). This\nFigure 11.4.1: The alternating harmonic series.\nsequence is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so it must converge, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=L\\). Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form a non-decreasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k}=M\\). Since \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\) and \\(s_{2k+1}=s_{2k}+a_{2k+1}\\),\n\\[L=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(s_{2k}+a_{2k+1})=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty }s_{2k}+\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}a_{2k+1}=M+0=M,\\]\nso \\(L=M\\), the two sequences of partial sums converge to the same limit, and this means the entire sequence of partial sums also converges to \\(L\\).\nAnother useful fact is implicit in this discussion. Suppose that\n\\[L=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFaced with a sequence we are interested in the limit\n\\[\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}a_{i}.\\]\nWe already understand\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\]\nwhen \\(x\\) is a real valued variable; now we simply want to restrict the \"input\" values to be integers. No real difference is required in the definition of limit, except that we specify, perhaps implicitly, that the variable is an integer. Compare this definition to definition 4.10.4.\n**DEFINITION 11.1.1** Suppose that \\({\\{a_{n}\\}}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a sequence. We say that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(n>N\\), \\(|a_{n}-L|<\\epsilon\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=L\\) we say that the sequence **converges**, otherwise it **diverges**. \\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0.

But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n**Example 11.1.13** All of the terms \\((2^{i}-1)/2^{i}\\) are less than 2, and the sequence is increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n\n\n",

For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0.

In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence.

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSince \\(f_{x}=e^{z}\\), \\(f=xe^{z}+g(y,z)\\). Since \\(f_{y}=1\\), it must be that \\(g_{y}=1\\), so \\(g(y,z)=y+h(z)\\). Thus \\(f=xe^{z}+y+h(z)\\) and\n\\[xe^{z}=f_{z}=xe^{z}+0+h^{\\prime}(z),\\]\nso \\(h^{\\prime}(z)=0\\), i.e., \\(h(z)=C\\), and \\(f=xe^{z}+y+C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe can rewrite Green's Theorem using these new ideas; these rewritten versions in turn are closer to some later theorems we will see.\nSuppose we write a two dimensional vector field in the form \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,0\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Then\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\bf i}&{\\bf j}&{\\bf k}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial z}\\\\ P&Q&0\\end{array}\\right|=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle,\\]\nand so \\((\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf k}=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot\\langle 0,0,1 \\rangle=Q_{x}-P_{y}\\). So Green's Theorem says\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint_{D} Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA=\\iint_{D}(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf k}\\,dA.\\] (16.5.1)\nRoughly speaking, the right-most integral adds up the curl (tendency to swirl) at each point in the region; the left-most integral adds up the tangential components of the vector field around the entire boundary. Green's Theorem says these are equal, or roughly, that the sum of the \"microscopic\" swirls over the region is the same as the \"macroscopic\" swirl around the boundary.\nNext, suppose that the boundary \\(\\partial D\\) has a vector form \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)\\) is tangent to the boundary, and \\({\\bf T}={\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)/|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\) is the usual unit tangent vector. Writing \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) we get\n\\[{\\bf T}={\\langle x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}\\rangle\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}\\]\nand then\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{\\partial D}\\!\\!x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0} ^{0}0\\,dy+\\int_{1}^{0}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)y\\,dy+\\int_{0}^{0}0\\,dx+\\int_ {1}^{0}0\\,dy\\cr&={1\\over 5}+0-{1\\over 5}+{1\\over 6}+0+0={1\\over 6}.\\cr}\\]\nAlternately, we could describe the three sides in vector form as \\(\\langle t,0\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1-t,t\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle 0,1-t\\rangle\\). Note that in each case, as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), we follow the corresponding side\nin the correct direction. Now\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}+t\\cdot 0\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt+ \\int_{0}^{1}0+0\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt=\\frac{1}{ 6}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\).

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{p}}\\,dx=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{x^{1-p}\\over 1-p}\\bigg{|} _{1}^{D}=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{D^{1-p}\\over 1-p}-{1\\over 1-p}.\\]\nIf \\(p>1\\) then \\(1-p<0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=0\\), so the integral converges. If \\(0<p<1\\) then \\(1-p>0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=\\infty\\), so the integral diverges.\n**Example 11.3.5** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{3}}\\) converges.\nWe could of course use the integral test, but now that we have the theorem we may simply note that this is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>1\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.6** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{n^{4}}\\) converges.\nWe know that if \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) converges then \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) also converges, by theorem 11.2.2. Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) is a convergent \\(p\\)-series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) converges also. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.7** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) diverges.\nThis also follows from theorem 11.2.2: Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p=1/2<1\\), it diverges, and so does \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSince it is typically difficult to compute the value of a series exactly, a good approximation is frequently required. In a real sense, a good approximation is only as good as we know it is, that is, while an approximation may in fact be good, it is only valuable in practice if we can guarantee its accuracy to some degree. This guarantee is usually easy to come by for series with decreasing positive terms.\n**Example 11.3.8** Approximate \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) to two decimal places.\nReferring to figure 11.3.1, if we approximate the sum by \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}1/n^{2}\\), the error we make is the total area of the remaining rectangles, all of which lie under the curve \\(1/x^{2}\\) from \\(x=N\\) out to infinity. So we know the true value of the series is larger than the approximation, and no bigger than the approximation plus the area under the curve from \\(N\\) to infinity. Roughly, then, we need to find \\(N\\) so that\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThis presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also need to approximate \\(e^{2}\\), and any approximation we use will increase the error, but we will not pursue this complication. \\(\\sqcap\\)\nNote well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on a small interval, even though the series for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\) converge for all \\(x\\); this is typical. To get the same accuracy on a larger interval would require more terms.\nExercises 11.11.\n1.

This is linear, but not homogeneous. The equation \\(\\dot{y}=ky\\), or \\(\\dot{y}-ky=0\\) is linear and homogeneous, with a particularly simple \\(p(t)=-k\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nBecause first order homogeneous linear equations are separable, we can solve them in the usual way:\n\\[\\dot{y}=-p(t)y\\]\n\\[\\int{1\\over y}\\,dy=\\int-p(t)\\,dt\\]\n\\[\\ln|y|=P(t)+C\\]\n\\[y=\\pm\\,e^{P(t)+C}\\]\n\\[y=Ae^{P(t)},\\]\nwhere \\(P(t)\\) is an anti-derivative of \\(-p(t)\\). As in previous examples, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the constant solution \\(y=0\\).\n**Example 17.2.3**.: Solve the initial value problems \\(\\dot{y}+y\\cos t=0\\), \\(y(0)=1/2\\) and \\(y(2)=1/2\\). We start with\n\\[P(t)=\\int-\\cos t\\,dt=-\\sin t,\\]\nso the general solution to the differential equation is\n\\[y=Ae^{-\\sin t}.\\]\nTo compute \\(A\\) we substitute:\n\\[{1\\over 2}=Ae^{-\\sin 0}=A,\\]\nso the solutions is\n\\[y={1\\over 2}e^{-\\sin t}.\\]\nFor the second problem,\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAs you might guess, a first order linear differential equation has the form \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Not only is this closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Let \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nbecomes more and more like the simple oscillation \\((1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\)--notice that the initial conditions don't matter to this long term behavior. The damped portion is called the **transient** part of the solution, and the simple oscillation is called the **steady state** part of the solution. A physical example is a mass-spring system. If the only force on the mass is due to the spring, then the behavior of the system is a damped oscillation. If in addition an external force is applied to the mass, and if the force varies according to a function of the form \\(a\\cos(\\omega t)+b\\sin(\\omega t)\\), then the long term behavior will be a simple oscillation determined by the steady state part of the general solution; the initial position of the mass will not matter. \\(\\Box\\)\nAs with the exponential form, such a simple guess may not work.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.7**: Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+16y=-\\sin(4t)\\). The roots of the characteristic equation are \\(\\pm 4i\\), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t)\\). Since both \\(\\cos(4t)\\) and \\(\\sin(4t)\\) are solutions to the homogeneous equation, \\(C\\cos(4t)+D\\sin(4t)\\) is also, so it cannot be a solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Instead, we guess \\(Ct\\cos(4t)+Dt\\sin(4t)\\).

Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\\[\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=2a-(2at+b)-6(at^{2}+bt+c)=-6at^{2}+(-2a-6b)t+(2a-b-6c).\\]\nWe want this to equal \\(18t^{2}+5\\), so we need\n\n\n",

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n**THEOREM 14.2.6** Polynomials are continuous everywhere.

Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{2^{x} }=0,\\]\nso by theorem 11.1.4 the sequence converges to \\(0\\).\n**Example 11.1.9**  Determine whether \\(\\{(\\sin n)/\\sqrt{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. Since \\(|\\sin n|\\leq 1\\), \\(0\\leq|\\sin n/\\sqrt{n}|\\leq 1/\\sqrt{n}\\) and we can use theorem 11.1.3 with \\(a_{n}=0\\) and \\(c_{n}=1/\\sqrt{n}\\). Since \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=0\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sin n/\\sqrt{n}=0\\) and the sequence converges to \\(0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nSuppose we want the derivative of \\(f(g(x))\\). Again, let's set up the derivative and play some algebraic tricks:\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}f(g(x))&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x+\\Delta x))-f(g(x)) \\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x+\\Delta x))-f(g(x))\\over g(x+\\Delta x )-g(x)}{g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\over\\Delta x}}\\]\nNow we see immediately that the second fraction turns into \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) when we take the limit. The first fraction is more complicated, but it too looks something like a derivative. The denominator, \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\), is a change in the value of \\(g\\), so let's abbreviate it as \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\), which also means \\(g(x+\\Delta x)=g(x)+\\Delta g\\). This gives us\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x)+\\Delta g)-f(g(x))\\over\\Delta g}.\\]\nAs \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to 0, it is also true that \\(\\Delta g\\) goes to 0, because \\(g(x+\\Delta x)\\) goes to \\(g(x)\\). So we can rewrite this limit as\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta g\\to 0}{f(g(x)+\\Delta g)-f(g(x))\\over\\Delta g}.\\]\nNow this looks exactly like a derivative, namely \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\), that is, the function \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g(x)\\). If this all withstands scrutiny, we then get\n\\[{d\\over dx}f(g(x))=f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x).\\]\nUnfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what we mean by \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\) involves what happens when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 _but not equal to 0_. The qualification is very important, since we must be able to divide by \\(\\Delta x\\). But when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 but not equal to 0, \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x))-g(x)\\) is close to 0 _and possibly equal to 0_. This means it doesn't really make sense to divide by \\(\\Delta g\\). Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to avoid this difficulty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details, which can be found in many calculus books. Note that many functions \\(g\\) do have the property that \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\neq 0\\) when \\(\\Delta x\\) is small, and for these functions the argument above is fine.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 4.10.8**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}\\).\nBoth the numerator and denominator approach zero, so applying L'Hopital's Rule:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}=\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x\\tan x}{\\cos x}= \\frac{1\\cdot 0}{1}=0.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 4.10.9**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}x\\ln x\\).\nThis doesn't appear to be suitable for L'Hopital's Rule, but it also is not \"obvious\".

Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nUnfortunately, this gives a function for which we can't find a simple anti-derivative. To complete the problem we could use Sage or similar software to approximate the integral.\n### 15 Volume and Average Height\nDoing this gives a volume of approximately 8.84, so the average height is approximately \\(8.84/6\\approx 1.47\\).\nBecause addition and multiplication are commutative and associative, we can rewrite the original double sum:\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x\\Delta y=\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1 }\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta y\\Delta x.\\]\nNow if we repeat the development above, the inner sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta y=\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y) \\,dy,\\]\nand then the outer sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\left(\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y)\\,dy\\right)\\Delta x =\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\nIn other words, we can compute the integrals in either order, first with respect to \\(x\\) then \\(y\\), or vice versa. Thinking of the loaf of bread, this corresponds to slicing the loaf in a direction perpendicular to the first.\nWe haven't really proved that the value of a double integral is equal to the value of the corresponding two single integrals in either order of integration, but provided the function is reasonably nice, this is true; the result is called **Fubini's Theorem**.\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface with slices.

As we have seen, sometimes changing from rectangular coordinates to another coordinate system is helpful, and this too changes the variables. This is certainly a more complicated change, since instead of changing one variable for another we change an entire suite of variables, but as it turns out it is really very similar to the kinds of change of variables we already know as substitution.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* Evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{x}\\int_{0}^{\\ln y}e^{x+y+z}\\,dz\\,dy\\,dx\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\sin\\theta}\\int_{0}^{r\\cos\\theta}r^{2}\\,dz\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\sin\\theta}\\int_{0}^{r\\sin\\theta}r\\cos^{2}\\theta\\,dz\\, dr\\,d\\theta\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Evaluate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{y^{2}}\\int_{0}^{x+y}x\\,dz\\,dx\\,dy\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Evaluate \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\int_{y}^{y^{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\ln(y+z)}e^{x}\\,dx\\,dz\\,dy\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Compute \\(\\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}z\\sin x+z\\cos y\\,dz\\,dy\\,dx\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* For each of the integrals in the previous exercises, give a description of the volume (both algebraic and geometric) that is the domain of integration.\n* Compute \\(\\int\\int\\int x+y+z\\,dV\\) over the region \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\\leq 1\\) in the first octant. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the mass of a cube with edge length 2 and density equal to the square of the distance from one corner. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the mass of a cube with edge length 2 and density equal to the square of the distance from one edge. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* An object occupies the volume of the upper hemisphere of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) and has density \\(z\\) at \\((x,y,z)\\).

For \\(z=\\sqrt{3}-i=\\sqrt{3}+(-1)i\\), we have \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)=\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)=-1\\). To find \\(|z|\\), \\(\\operatorname{arg}(z)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)\\), we need to find a polar representation \\((r,\\theta)\\) with \\(r\\geq 0\\) for the point \\(P(\\sqrt{3},-1)\\) associated with \\(z\\). We know \\(r^{2}=(\\sqrt{3})^{2}+(-1)^{2}=4\\), so \\(r=\\pm 2\\). Since we require \\(r\\geq 0\\), we choose \\(r=2\\), so \\(|z|=2\\). Next, we find a corresponding angle \\(\\theta\\). Since \\(r>0\\) and \\(P\\) lies in Quadrant IV, \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant IV angle. We know \\(\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), so \\(\\theta=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{arg}(z)=\\big{\\{}-\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\,|\\,k\\text{ is an integer}\\big{\\}}\\). Of these values, only \\(\\theta=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) satisfies the requirement that \\(-\\pi<\\theta\\leq\\pi\\), hence \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n2. The complex number \\(z=-2+4i\\) has \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)=-2\\), \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)=4\\), and is associated with the point \\(P(-2,4)\\). Our next task is to find a polar representation \\((r,\\theta)\\) for \\(P\\) where \\(r\\geq 0\\). Running through the usual calculations gives \\(r=2\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(|z|=2\\sqrt{5}\\). To find \\(\\theta\\), we get \\(\\tan(\\theta)=-2\\), and since \\(r>0\\) and \\(P\\) lies in Quadrant II, we know \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. We find \\(\\theta=\\pi+\\arctan(-2)+2\\pi k\\), or, more succinctly \\(\\theta=\\pi-\\arctan(2)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Hence \\(\\operatorname{arg}(z)=\\{\\pi-\\arctan(2)+2\\pi k\\,|\\,k\\text{ is an integer}\\}\\). Only \\(\\theta=\\pi-\\arctan(2)\\) satisfies the requirement \\(-\\pi<\\theta\\leq\\pi\\), so \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)=\\pi-\\arctan(2)\\).\n3. We rewrite \\(z=3i\\) as \\(z=0+3i\\) to find \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)=0\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)=3\\). The point in the plane which corresponds to \\(z\\) is \\((0,3)\\) and while we could go through the usual calculations to find the required polar form of this point, we can almost 'see' the answer. The point \\((0,3)\\) lies \\(3\\) units away from the origin on the positive \\(y\\)-axis. Hence, \\(r=|z|=3\\) and \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We get \\(\\arg(z)=\\left\\{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi k\\,|\\,k\\text{ is an integer}\\right\\}\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n* The plane that passes through the point \\((1,2,-3)\\) and is parallel to the vectors \\(\\langle 1,1,-1\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle 1,-1,1\\rangle\\).\n* The lower half of the ellipsoid \\(2x^{2}+4y^{2}+z^{2}=1\\).\n* The part of the sphere of radius 4 centered at the origin that lies between the planes \\(z=-2\\) and \\(z=2\\).\n* Find the area of the portion of \\(x+2y+4z=10\\) in the first octant. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the portion of \\(2x+4y+z=0\\) inside \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) that lies below \\(z=1\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) that lies below \\(z=2\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the portion of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies in the first octant. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the portion of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies above \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq b^{2}\\), \\(b\\leq a\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=x^{2}-y^{2}\\) that lies inside \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=xy\\) that lies inside \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies above the interior of the circle given in polar coordinates by \\(r=a\\cos\\theta\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the cone \\(z=k\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) that lies above the interior of the circle given in polar coordinates by \\(r=a\\cos\\theta\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the plane \\(z=ax+by+c\\) that lies over a region \\(D\\) with area \\(A\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\n\n",

Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\).

The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals.

Since \\(u=x^{2}\\), when \\(x=2\\), \\(u=4\\), and when \\(x=4\\), \\(u=16\\).

Derive a formula for \\(\\tan(\\alpha+\\beta)\\) in terms of \\(\\tan(\\alpha)\\) and \\(\\tan(\\beta)\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. As in Example 10.4.1, we need to write the angle \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\) as a sum or difference of common angles. The denominator of 12 suggests a combination of angles with denominators 3 and 4. One such combination is \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Applying Theorem 10.15, we get \\[\\sin\\left(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)+ \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) +\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\] \\[= \\frac{-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\]\n2. In order to find \\(\\sin(\\alpha-\\beta)\\) using Theorem 10.15, we need to find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\) and both \\(\\cos(\\beta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\beta)\\). To find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\), we use the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(\\alpha)+\\sin^{2}(\\alpha)=1\\). Since \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{5}{13}\\), we have \\(\\cos^{2}(\\alpha)+\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)^{2}=1\\), or \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\pm\\frac{12}{13}\\). Since \\(\\alpha\\) is a Quadrant II angle, \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=-\\frac{12}{13}\\). We now set about finding \\(\\cos(\\beta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\beta)\\). We have several ways to proceed, but the Pythagorean Identity \\(1+\\tan^{2}(\\beta)=\\sec^{2}(\\beta)\\) is a quick way to get \\(\\sec(\\beta)\\), and hence, \\(\\cos(\\beta)\\). With \\(\\tan(\\beta)=2\\), we get \\(1+2^{2}=\\sec^{2}(\\beta)\\) so that \\(\\sec(\\beta)=\\pm\\sqrt{5}\\). Since \\(\\beta\\) is a Quadrant III angle, we choose \\(\\sec(\\beta)=-\\sqrt{5}\\) so \\(\\cos(\\beta)=\\frac{1}{\\sec(\\beta)}=\\frac{1}{-\\sqrt{5}}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\). We now need to determine \\(\\sin(\\beta)\\). We could use The Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(\\beta)+\\sin^{2}(\\beta)=1\\), but we opt instead to use a quotient identity. From \\(\\tan(\\beta)=\\frac{\\sin(\\beta)}{\\cos(\\beta)}\\), we have \\(\\sin(\\beta)=\\tan(\\beta)\\cos(\\beta)\\) so we get \\(\\sin(\\beta)=(2)\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)=-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\).

More generally, we'd like to have a formula to compute the derivative of** \\(f(x)/g(x)\\) **if we already know** \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) **and** \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\)**. Instead of attacking this problem head-on, let's notice that we've already done part of the problem:** \\(f(x)/g(x)=f(x)\\cdot(1/g(x))\\)**, that is, this is \"really\" a product, and we can compute the derivative if we know** \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) **and** \\((1/g(x))^{\\prime}\\)**. So really the only new bit of information we need is** \\((1/g(x))^{\\prime}\\) **in terms of** \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\)**. As with the product rule, let's set this up and see how\nfar we can get:\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}{1\\over g(x)}&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{1\\over g(x+\\Delta x)}-{1\\over g(x)} \\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{g(x)-g(x+\\Delta x)\\over g(x+\\Delta x)g(x)}\\cr&= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{g(x)-g(x+\\Delta x)\\over g(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\Delta x}\\cr&= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}-{g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\over\\Delta x}{1\\over g(x+\\Delta x)g(x)}\\cr&=-{ g^{\\prime}(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}}\\]\nNow we can put this together with the product rule:\n\\[{d\\over dx}{f(x)\\over g(x)}=f(x){-g^{\\prime}(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}+f^{\\prime}(x){ 1\\over g(x)}={-f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}={f^{\\prime} (x)g(x)-f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}.\\]\n**EXAMPLE 3.4.1** Compute the derivative of \\((x^{2}+1)/(x^{3}-3x)\\).\n\\[{d\\over dx}{x^{2}+1\\over x^{3}-3x}={2x(x^{3}-3x)-(x^{2}+1)(3x^{2}-3)\\over(x^{ 3}-3x)^{2}}={-x^{4}-6x^{2}+3\\over(x^{3}-3x)^{2}}.\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nIt is often possible to calculate derivatives in more than one way, as we have already seen. Since every quotient can be written as a product, it is always possible to use the product rule to compute the derivative, though it is not always simpler.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nHere are two simple but useful facts about divergence and curl.\n**Theorem 16.5.1**: \\(\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})=0\\)_._\nIn words, this says that the divergence of the curl is zero.\n**Theorem 16.5.2**: \\(\\nabla\\times(\\nabla f)={\\bf 0}\\)_._\nThat is, the curl of a gradient is the zero vector. Recalling that gradients are conservative vector fields, this says that the curl of a conservative vector field is the zero vector. Under suitable conditions, it is also true that if the curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\({\\bf 0}\\) then \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative. (Note that this is exactly the same test that we discussed on page 427.)\n**Example 16.5.3**: Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle e^{z},1,xe^{z}\\rangle\\). Then \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\langle 0,e^{z}-e^{z},0\\rangle={\\bf 0}\\). Thus, \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, and we can exhibit this directly by finding the corresponding \\(f\\).\nSince \\(f_{x}=e^{z}\\), \\(f=xe^{z}+g(y,z)\\). Since \\(f_{y}=1\\), it must be that \\(g_{y}=1\\), so \\(g(y,z)=y+h(z)\\). Thus \\(f=xe^{z}+y+h(z)\\) and\n\\[xe^{z}=f_{z}=xe^{z}+0+h^{\\prime}(z),\\]\nso \\(h^{\\prime}(z)=0\\), i.e., \\(h(z)=C\\), and \\(f=xe^{z}+y+C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe can rewrite Green's Theorem using these new ideas; these rewritten versions in turn are closer to some later theorems we will see.\nSuppose we write a two dimensional vector field in the form \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,0\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Then\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\bf i}&{\\bf j}&{\\bf k}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial z}\\\\ P&Q&0\\end{array}\\right|=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle,\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 4.8.1** Find the slope of the circle \\(4=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) at the point \\((1,-\\sqrt{3})\\). Since we know both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of the point of interest, we do not need to explicitly recognize that this point is on \\(L(x)\\), and we do not need to use \\(L(x)\\) to compute \\(y\\)--but we could. Using the calculation of \\(y^{\\prime}\\) from above,\n\\[y^{\\prime}=-{x\\over y}=-{1\\over-\\sqrt{3}}={1\\over\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nIt is instructive to compare this approach to others.\nWe might have recognized at the start that \\((1,-\\sqrt{3})\\) is on the function \\(y=L(x)=-\\sqrt{4-x^{2}}\\). We could then take the derivative of \\(L(x)\\), using the power rule and the chain rule, to get\n\\[L^{\\prime}(x)=-{1\\over 2}(4-x^{2})^{-1/2}(-2x)={x\\over\\sqrt{4-x^{2}}}.\\]\nThen we could compute \\(L^{\\prime}(1)=1/\\sqrt{3}\\) by substituting \\(x=1\\).\nAlternately, we could realize that the point is on \\(L(x)\\), but use the fact that \\(y^{\\prime}=-x/y\\). Since the point is on \\(L(x)\\) we can replace \\(y\\) by \\(L(x)\\) to get\n\\[y^{\\prime}=-{x\\over L(x)}={x\\over\\sqrt{4-x^{2}}},\\]\nwithout computing the derivative of \\(L(x)\\) explicitly. Then we substitute \\(x=1\\) and get the same answer as before. \\(\\sqcap\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nIn the case of the circle it is possible to find the functions \\(U(x)\\) and \\(L(x)\\) explicitly, but there are potential advantages to using implicit differentiation anyway. In some cases it is more difficult or impossible to find an explicit formula for \\(y\\) and implicit differentiation is the only way to find the derivative.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. Reflection across the \\(x\\)-axis\n3. Horizontal shift right 1 unit\n4. Horizontal stretching by a factor of 2\n**Solution.** We build up to a formula for \\(g(x)\\) using intermediate functions as we've seen in previous examples. We let \\(g_{1}\\) take care of our first step. Theorem 1.2 tells us \\(g_{1}(x)=f(x)+2=x^{2}+2\\). Next, we reflect the graph of \\(g_{1}\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis using Theorem 1.4: \\(g_{2}(x)=-g_{1}(x)=-\\left(x^{2}+2\\right)=-x^{2}-2\\). We shift the graph to the right 1 unit, according to Theorem 1.3, by setting \\(g_{3}(x)=g_{2}(x-1)=-(x-1)^{2}-2=-x^{2}+2x-3\\). Finally, we induce a horizontal stretch by a factor of 2 using Theorem 1.6 to get \\(g(x)=g_{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)=-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)^{2}+2\\left( \\frac{1}{2}x\\right)-3\\) which yields \\(g(x)=-\\frac{1}{4}x^{2}+x-3\\). We use the calculator to graph the stages below to confirm our result.\n\\(y=f(x)=x^{2}\\)\\(y=g_{1}(x)=f(x)+2=x^{2}+2\\)\\(y=g_{1}(x)=x^{2}+2\\)\\(y=g_{1}(x)=x^{2}+2\\)\\(y=g_{1}(x)=x^{2}+2\\)\nWe have kept the viewing window the same in all of the graphs above. This had the undesirable consequence of making the last graph look 'incomplete' in that we cannot see the original shape of \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). Altering the viewing window results in a more complete graph of the transformed function as seen below.\nThis example brings our first chapter to a close. In the chapters which lie ahead, be on the lookout for the concepts developed here to resurface as we study different families of functions.\n\n\n",

As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.\n**THEOREM 11.4.1** Suppose that \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\).

If \\(r=-1\\) this is the sequence of example 11.1.7 and diverges. If \\(r>1\\) or \\(r<-1\\) the terms \\(r^{n}\\) get large without limit, so the sequence diverges.

In some cases we can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n**Example 11.1.13** All of the terms \\((2^{i}-1)/2^{i}\\) are less than 2, and the sequence is increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing.

Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges.

We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nUse the linear approximation to estimate (3.99)^3 (1.01)^4 (1.98)^{-1}.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe can compute the integral:\n\\[\\int_{N}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\,dx=\\frac{1}{N},\\]\nso \\(N=100\\) is a good starting point. Adding up the first 100 terms gives approximately \\(1.634983900\\), and that plus \\(1/100\\) is \\(1.644983900\\), so approximating the series by the value halfway between these will be at most \\(1/200=0.005\\) in error. The midpoint is \\(1.639983900\\), but while this is correct to \\(\\pm 0.005\\), we can't tell if the correct two-decimal approximation is \\(1.63\\) or \\(1.64\\). We need to make \\(N\\) big enough to reduce the guaranteed error, perhaps to around \\(0.004\\) to be safe, so we would need \\(1/N\\approx 0.008\\), or \\(N=125\\). Now the sum of the first 125 terms is approximately \\(1.636965982\\), and that plus \\(0.008\\) is \\(1.644965982\\) and the point halfway between them is \\(1.640965982\\). The true value is then \\(1.640965982\\pm 0.004\\), and all numbers in this range round to \\(1.64\\), so \\(1.64\\) is correct to two decimal places. We have mentioned that the true value of this series can be shown to be \\(\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.644934068\\) which rounds down to \\(1.64\\) (just barely) and is indeed below the upper bound of \\(1.644965982\\), again just barely. Frequently approximations will be even better than the \"guaranteed\" accuracy, but not always, as this example demonstrates. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 11.3\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nas desired.

If we are to attack this data from a scientific perspective, it does seem to make sense that, at least in the early stages of the outbreak, the more people who have the flu, the faster it will spread, which leads us to proposing an uninhibited growth model. If we assume \\(N=Be^{At}\\) then, taking logs as before, we get \\(\\ln(N)=At+\\ln(B)\\). If we set \\(X=t\\) and \\(Y=\\ln(N)\\), then, once again, we get \\(Y=AX+\\ln(B)\\), a line with slope \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\)-intercept \\(\\ln(B)\\). Plotting \\(\\ln(N)\\) versus \\(t\\) gives the following linear regression.\nWe see the slope is \\(a\\approx 0.202\\) and which corresponds to \\(A\\) in our model, and the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(b\\approx 5.596\\) which corresponds to \\(\\ln(B)\\). We get \\(B\\approx 269.414\\), so that our model is \\(N=269.414e^{0.202t}\\). Of course, the calculator has a built-in 'Exponential Regression' feature which produces what appears to be a different model \\(N=269.414(1.22333419)^{t}\\). Using properties of exponents, we write \\(e^{0.202t}=\\left(e^{0.202}\\right)^{t}\\approx(1.223848)^{t}\\), which, had we carried more decimal places, would have matched the base of the calculator model exactly.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[e^{x}=e^{2}+e^{2}(x-2)+{e^{2}\\over 2}(x-2)^{2}+{e^{2}\\over 6}(x-2)^{3}+{e^{2} \\over 24}(x-2)^{4}+{e^{2}\\over 120}(x-2)^{5}\\pm 0.0015.\\]\nThis presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also need to approximate \\(e^{2}\\), and any approximation we use will increase the error, but we will not pursue this complication. \\(\\sqcap\\)\nNote well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on a small interval, even though the series for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\) converge for all \\(x\\); this is typical.

Is there a value $x$ between 10pi and 11pi such that $f'(x) = 0$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. We begin solving \\(2\\sin(x)\\leq 1\\) by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and zero on the other to get \\(2\\sin(x)-1\\leq 0\\). Next, we let \\(f(x)=2\\sin(x)-1\\) and note that our original inequality is equivalent to solving \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\). We now look to see where, if ever, \\(f\\) is undefined and where \\(f(x)=0\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, we can immediately set about finding the zeros of \\(f\\). Solving \\(f(x)=0\\), we have \\(2\\sin(x)-1=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). The solutions here are \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since we are restricting our attention to \\([0,2\\pi)\\), only \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) are of concern to us. Next, we choose test values in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) other than the zeros and determine if \\(f\\) is positive or negative there. For \\(x=0\\) we have \\(f(0)=-1\\), for \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) and for \\(x=\\pi\\) we get \\(f(\\pi)=-1\\). Since our original inequality is equivalent to \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\), we are looking for where the function is negative \\((-)\\) or \\(0\\), and we get the intervals \\(\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right]\\cup\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{6},2\\pi\\right)\\). We can confirm our answer graphically by seeing where the graph of \\(y=2\\sin(x)\\) crosses or is below the graph of \\(y=1\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThis example also points the way to a simple method for approximating roots.\n**Example 2.5.8**: **Approximate the root of the previous example to one decimal place.**\nIf we compute \\(f(0.1)\\), \\(f(0.2)\\), and so on, we find that \\(f(0.6)<0\\) and \\(f(0.7)>0\\), so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, \\(f\\) has a root between \\(0.6\\) and \\(0.7\\).

We could have used other values, say \\(-5/4\\), \\(1/3\\), and \\(3/4\\), but this would have made the calculations considerably more tedious.\n**Example 5.1.3** Find all local maximum and minimum points for \\(f(x)=\\sin x+\\cos x\\). The derivative is \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=\\cos x-\\sin x\\). This is always defined and is zero whenever \\(\\cos x=\\sin x\\). Recalling that the \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(\\sin x\\) are the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of points on a unit circle, we see that \\(\\cos x=\\sin x\\) when \\(x\\) is \\(\\pi/4\\), \\(\\pi/4\\pm\\pi\\), \\(\\pi/4\\pm 2\\pi\\), \\(\\pi/4\\pm 3\\pi\\), etc. Since both sine and cosine have a period of \\(2\\pi\\), we need only determine the status of \\(x=\\pi/4\\) and \\(x=5\\pi/4\\). We can use \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi/2\\) to test the critical value \\(x=\\pi/4\\). We find that \\(f(\\pi/4)=\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(f(0)=1<\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(f(\\pi/2)=1\\), so there is a local maximum when \\(x=\\pi/4\\) and also when \\(x=\\pi/4\\pm 2\\pi\\), \\(\\pi/4\\pm 4\\pi\\), etc. We can summarize this more neatly by saying that there are local maxima at \\(\\pi/4\\pm 2k\\pi\\) for every integer \\(k\\).\nWe use \\(\\pi\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) to test the critical value \\(x=5\\pi/4\\). The relevant values are \\(f(5\\pi/4)=-\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(f(\\pi)=-1>-\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(f(2\\pi)=1>-\\sqrt{2}\\), so there is a local minimum at \\(x=5\\pi/4\\), \\(5\\pi/4\\pm 2\\pi\\), \\(5\\pi/4\\pm 4\\pi\\), etc. More succinctly, there are local minima at \\(5\\pi/4\\pm 2k\\pi\\) for every integer \\(k\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\nFigure 6.4.1: The linear approximation to \\(y=x^{2}\\).\nfunctions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.\n##### Example 6.4.2\nConsider the trigonometric function \\(\\sin x\\). Its linear approximation at \\(x=0\\) is simply \\(L(x)=x\\). When \\(x\\) is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.\n##### Definition 6.4.3\nLet \\(y=f(x)\\) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable \\(dx\\), and a new dependent variable \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\). Notice that \\(dy\\) is a function both of \\(x\\) (since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is a function of \\(x\\)) and of \\(dx\\). We say that \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are **differentials**.\n_Remark._ Up until now, \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) made sense only together, as \\(dy/dx\\), another way to write \\(f^{\\prime}\\). Now we have given them have individual meanings, but notice that since \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\), \\(dy/dx=f^{\\prime}(x)\\), so the new meanings are consistent with the former usage.\n\n\n",

Suppose we wish to find the zeros of \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x+5\\). To solve the equation \\(x^{2}-2x+5=0\\), we note that the quadratic doesn't factor nicely, so we resort to the Quadratic Formula, Equation 2.5 and obtain\n\\[x=\\frac{-(-2)\\pm\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{-16}}{2}=\\frac {2\\pm 4i}{2}=1\\pm 2i.\\]\nTwo things are important to note. First, the zeros \\(1+2i\\) and \\(1-2i\\) are complex conjugates. If ever we obtain non-real zeros to a quadratic function with real coefficients, the zeros will be a complex conjugate pair. (Do you see why?) Next, we note that in Example 3.4.1, part 6, we found \\((x-[1+2i])(x-[1-2i])=x^{2}-2x+5\\). This demonstrates that the factor theorem holds even for non-real zeros, i.e, \\(x=1+2i\\) is a zero of \\(f\\), and, sure enough, \\((x-[1+2i])\\) is a factor of \\(f(x)\\). It turns out that polynomial division works the same way for all complex numbers, real and non-real alike, so the Factor and Remainder Theorems hold as well. But how do we know if a\ngeneral polynomial has any complex zeros at all? We have many examples of polynomials with no real zeros. Can there be polynomials with no zeros whatsoever? The answer to that last question is \"No.\" and the theorem which provides that answer is The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFrom the graph in figure 6.3.2 we guess \\(x_{0}=1\\) as a starting point, then using the formula we compute \\(x_{1}=1.310478030\\), \\(x_{2}=1.223929096\\), \\(x_{3}=1.176050900\\), \\(x_{4}=1.165926508\\), \\(x_{5}=1.165561636\\). So we guess that the first three places are correct, but that is not the same as saying 1.165 is correct to three decimal places--1.166 might be the correct, rounded approximation. How can we tell? We can substitute 1.165, 1.1655 and 1.166 into \\(\\tan x-2x\\); this gives \\(-0.002483652\\), \\(-0.000271247\\), \\(0.001948654\\). Since the first two are negative and the third is positive, \\(\\tan x-2x\\) crosses the \\(x\\) axis between 1.1655 and 1.166, so the correct value to three places is 1.166. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 6.3\nYou may want to use this Sage worksheet.\n1.

Use Newton's Method to approximate the cube root of 10 to two decimal places. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n3.

A rectangular piece of cardboard of dimensions \\(8\\times 17\\) is used to make an open-top box by cutting out a small square of side \\(x\\) from each corner and bending up the sides. (See exercise 20 in 6.1.) If \\(x=2\\), then the volume of the box is \\(2\\cdot 4\\cdot 13=104\\). Use Newton's method to find a value of \\(x\\) for which the box has volume 100, accurate to 3 significant figures. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n4. From the graph, we know \\(f\\) has two real zeros, one positive, and one negative. Our only hope at this point is to try and find the zeros of \\(f\\) by setting \\(f(x)=x^{4}+x^{2}-12=0\\) and solving. If we stare at this equation long enough, we may recognize it as a 'quadratic in disguise' or 'quadratic in form'. In other words, we have three terms: \\(x^{4}\\), \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(12\\), and the exponent on the first term, \\(x^{4}\\), is exactly twice that of the second term, \\(x^{2}\\). We may rewrite this as \\(\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(x^{2}\\right)-12=0\\). To better see the forest for the trees, we momentarily replace \\(x^{2}\\) with the variable \\(u\\). In terms of \\(u\\), our equation becomes \\(u^{2}+u-12=0\\), which we can readily factor as \\(\\left(u+4\\right)\\left(u-3\\right)=0\\). In terms of \\(x\\), this means \\(x^{4}+x^{2}-12=\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\left(x^{2}+4\\right)=0\\). We get \\(x^{2}=3\\), which gives us \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\), or \\(x^{2}=-4\\), which admits no real solutions. Since \\(\\sqrt{3}\\approx 1.73\\), the two zeros match what we expected from the graph. In terms of multiplicity, the Factor Theorem guarantees \\(\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x+\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) are factors of \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(f(x)\\) can be factored as \\(f(x)=\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\left(x^{2}+4\\right)\\), and \\(x^{2}+4\\) has no real zeros, the quantities \\(\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x+\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) must both be factors of \\(x^{2}-3\\). According to Theorem 3.7, \\(x^{2}-3\\) can have at most \\(2\\) zeros, counting multiplicity, hence each of \\(\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\) is a zero of \\(f\\) of multiplicity \\(1\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThis is most frequently used when \\(d=0\\).\n**Example 2.5.7**: **Explain why the function \\(f=x^{3}+3x^{2}+x-2\\) has a root between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\nBy theorem 2.3.6, \\(f\\) is continuous.

Repeating the process\nwith \\(f(0.61)\\), \\(f(0.62)\\), and so on, we find that \\(f(0.61)<0\\) and \\(f(0.62)>0\\), so \\(f\\) has a root between \\(0.61\\) and \\(0.62\\), and the root is \\(0.6\\) rounded to one decimal place. \\(\\Box\\)\nExercises 2.5.\n1.

With that being said, most students see the result as common sense since it says, geometrically, that the graph of a polynomial function cannot be above the \\(x\\)-axis at one point and below the \\(x\\)-axis at another point without crossing the \\(x\\)-axis somewhere in between. The following example uses the Intermediate Value Theorem to establish a fact that that most students take for granted. Many students, and sadly some instructors, will find it silly.\n**Example 3.1.4**.: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to establish that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is a real number.\n**Solution.** Consider the polynomial function \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2\\). Then \\(f(1)=-1\\) and \\(f(3)=7\\). Since \\(f(1)\\) and \\(f(3)\\) have different signs, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees us a real number \\(c\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(3\\) with \\(f(c)=0\\). If \\(c^{2}-2=0\\) then \\(c=\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\). Since \\(c\\) is between \\(1\\) and \\(3\\), \\(c\\) is positive, so \\(c=\\sqrt{2}\\).\nOur primary use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in the construction of sign diagrams, as in Section 2.4, since it guarantees us that polynomial functions are always positive (\\(+\\)) or always negative (\\(-\\)) on intervals which do not contain any of its zeros. The general algorithm for polynomials is given below.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nFind the solutions y of the differential equation y'=(t^2+3y^2)/2ty with y(1) = 1. What is y(2)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[y={1\\over 2}e^{\\sin 2}e^{-\\sin t}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\n#### Example 17.2.4\nSolve the initial value problem \\(t\\dot{y}+3y=0\\), \\(y(1)=2\\), assuming \\(t>0\\).

This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\\[\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=2a-(2at+b)-6(at^{2}+bt+c)=-6at^{2}+(-2a-6b)t+(2a-b-6c).\\]\nWe want this to equal \\(18t^{2}+5\\), so we need\n\n\n",

Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\nThis has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:\nProof that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Given any \\(\\epsilon\\), pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Then when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), \\(|x+2|<5\\) and \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\nTo compute the desired limit it is sufficient to compute the limits of the two final fractions, as \\(x\\) goes to 0. The first of these is the hard limit we've just done, namely 1. The second turns out to be simple, because the denominator presents no problem:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\sin 0}{\\cos 0+1}=\\frac{0}{2}=0.\\]\nThus,\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=0.\\]\nExercises 4.3. **1.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(5x)}{x}\\Rightarrow\\) **2.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(7x)}{\\sin(2x)}\\Rightarrow\\) **3.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cot(4x)}{\\csc(3x)}\\Rightarrow\\) **4.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\tan x}{x}\\Rightarrow\\) **5.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pi/4}\\frac{\\sin x-\\cos x}{\\cos(2x)}\\Rightarrow\\) **6.** For all \\(x\\geq 0\\), \\(4x-9\\leq f(x)\\leq x^{2}-4x+7\\).

Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n",

To that end, we re-write \\(g(x)=12x+x^{3}=x^{3}+12x\\), and see that the degree of \\(g\\) is 3, the leading term is \\(x^{3}\\), the leading coefficient is 1 and the constant term is 0.\n3. We need to rewrite the formula for \\(h\\) so that it resembles the form given in Definition 3.2: \\(h(x)=\\frac{4-x}{5}=\\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{x}{5}=-\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{4}{5}\\). The degree of \\(h\\) is 1, the leading term is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}x\\), the leading coefficient is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) and the constant term is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n4. It may seem that we have some work ahead of us to get \\(p\\) in the form of Definition 3.2. However, it is possible to glean the information requested about \\(p\\) without multiplying out the entire expression \\((2x-1)^{3}(x-2)(3x+2)\\). The leading term of \\(p\\) will be the term which has the highest power of \\(x\\). The way to get this term is to multiply the terms with the highest power of \\(x\\) from each factor together - in other words, the leading term of \\(p(x)\\) is the product of the leading terms of the factors of \\(p(x)\\). Hence, the leading term of \\(p\\) is \\((2x)^{3}(x)(3x)=24x^{5}\\). This means that the degree of \\(p\\) is 5 and the leading coefficient is 24. As for the constant term, we can perform a similar trick. The constant term is obtained by multiplying the constant terms from each of the factors \\((-1)^{3}(-2)(2)=4\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n2. Proceeding as before, we determine the domain of \\(g\\) by solving \\(x+1=0\\). As before, we find the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,\\infty)\\). To write \\(g(x)\\) in the form requested, we need to get a common denominator \\[g(x) = 2-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\qquad=\\ \\ \\frac{2}{1}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2)(x+1)}{(1)(x+1)}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x+2)-3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\] This formula is now completely simplified.\n3. The denominators in the formula for \\(h(x)\\) are both \\(x^{2}-1\\) whose zeros are \\(x=\\pm 1\\). As a result, the domain of \\(h\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\). We now proceed to simplify \\(h(x)\\). Since we have the same denominator in both terms, we subtract the numerators. We then factor the resulting numerator and denominator, and cancel out the common factor. \\[h(x) = \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}-\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{\\left(2x^{2}-1\\right)-(3x-2)}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-1-3x+2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-3x+1}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\ \\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\]\n4. To find the domain of \\(r\\), it may help to temporarily rewrite \\(r(x)\\) as \\[r(x)=\\frac{\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}}{\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}}\\] We need to set all of the denominators equal to zero which means we need to solve not only \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), but also \\(\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}=0\\). We find \\(x=\\pm 1\\) for the former and \\(x=\\frac{2}{3}\\) for the latter. Our domain is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup\\left(-1,\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{2}{3},1\\right)\\cup (1,\\infty)\\). We simplify \\(r(x)\\) by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and then by canceling the common factor\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nthe \\(x\\)-axis at \\((-1,0)\\). It should make you uncomfortable plugging \\(x=-1\\) into the reduced formula for \\(h(x)\\), especially since we've made such a big deal concerning the stipulation about not letting \\(x=-1\\) for that formula. What we are really doing is taking a Calculus short-cut to the more detailed kind of analysis near \\(x=-1\\) which we will show below. Speaking of which, for the discussion that follows, we will use the formula \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}\\), \\(x\\neq-1\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=h(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\). We have \\(h(x)\\approx\\frac{(-3)(-1)}{(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\frac{3}{(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\) very big \\((-)\\) thus as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(h(x)\\to-\\infty\\). On the other side of \\(-2\\), as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we find that \\(h(x)\\approx\\frac{3}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\) very big \\((+)\\), so \\(h(x)\\to\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=h(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-1\\)._ As \\(x\\to-1^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number a bit less than \\(x=-1\\). We have \\(h(x)\\approx\\frac{(-1)(\\text{very small }(-))}{1}=\\) very small \\((+)\\) Hence, as \\(x\\to-1^{-}\\), \\(h(x)\\to 0^{+}\\). This means that as \\(x\\to-1^{-}\\), the graph is a bit above the point \\((-1,0)\\). As \\(x\\to-1^{+}\\), we get \\(h(x)\\approx\\frac{(-1)(\\text{very small }(+))}{1}=\\) very small \\((-)\\). This gives us that as \\(x\\to-1^{+}\\), \\(h(x)\\to 0^{-}\\), so the graph is a little bit lower than \\((-1,0)\\) here.\n\n\n",

In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\iint_{D}(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{ \\bf N}\\,dS,\\]\nif \\(\\partial D\\) is oriented counter-clockwise relative to \\({\\bf N}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nNote how little has changed: \\({\\bf k}\\) becomes \\({\\bf N}\\), a unit normal to the surface (just as \\({\\bf k}\\) is a unit normal to the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\)-plane), and \\(dA\\) becomes \\(dS\\), since this is now a general surface integral. The phrase \"counter-clockwise relative to \\({\\bf N}\\)\" means roughly that if we take the direction of \\({\\bf N}\\) to be \"up\", then we go around the boundary counter-clockwise when viewed from \"above\". In many cases, this description is inadequate. A slightly more complicated but general description is this: imagine standing on the side of the surface considered positive; walk to the boundary and turn left. You are now following the boundary in the correct direction.\n**Example 16.8.2**: Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle e^{xy}\\cos z,x^{2}z,xy\\rangle\\) and the surface \\(D\\) be \\(x=\\sqrt{1-y^{2}-z^{2}}\\), oriented in the positive \\(x\\) direction.

If \\(k\\) is the only root of the characteristic equation, then \\(Cte^{kt}\\) will not work, and we must guess \\(Ct^{2}e^{kt}\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.5** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}-6\\dot{y}+9y=e^{3t}\\). The characteristic equation is \\(r^{2}-6r+9=(r-3)^{2}\\), so the general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Bte^{3t}\\).

The roots of the characteristic equation are \\(-3\\pm 4i\\), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\). For a particular solution, we guess \\(C\\cos(4t)+D\\sin(4t)\\). Substituting as usual:\n\\[\\eqalign{(-16C\\cos(4t)&+-16D\\sin(4t))+6(-4C\\sin(4t)+4D\\cos(4t))+25(C\\cos(4t)+ D\\sin(4t))\\cr&=(24D+9C)\\cos(4t)+(-24C+9D)\\sin(4t).\\cr}\\]\nTo make this equal to \\(\\cos(4t)\\) we need\n\\[\\eqalign{24D+9C&=1\\cr 9D-24C&=0\\cr}\\]\nwhich gives \\(C=1/73\\) and \\(D=8/219\\). The full solution is then \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))+(1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\).\n**476**: **Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nThe function \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\) is a damped oscillation as in example 17.5.3, while \\((1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\) is a simple undamped oscillation. As \\(t\\) increases, the sum \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\) approaches zero, so the solution\n\\[e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))+(1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\nFinally we substitute to find \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}+A(1)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{6}+A\\] \\[A=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThe solution is then\n\\[y=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}t^{-3}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nHere is an alternate method for finding a particular solution to the differential equation, using an **integrating factor**. In the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), we note that if we multiply through by a function \\(I(t)\\) to get \\(I(t)\\dot{y}+I(t)p(t)y=I(t)f(t)\\), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product rule:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(I(t)y)=I(t)\\dot{y}+I^{\\prime}(t)y.\\]\nNow if we could choose \\(I(t)\\) so that \\(I^{\\prime}(t)=I(t)p(t)\\), this would be exactly the left hand side of the differential equation. But this is just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution is \\(I(t)=e^{Q(t)}\\), where \\(Q(t)=\\int p\\,dt\\); note that \\(Q(t)=-P(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) appears in the variation of parameters method and \\(P^{\\prime}(t)=-p\\). Now the modified differential equation is\n\\[e^{-P(t)}\\dot{y}+e^{-P(t)}p(t)y =e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-P(t)}y) =e^{-P(t)}f(t).\\]\nIntegrating both sides gives\n\\[e^{-P(t)}y =\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt\\] \\[y =e^{P(t)}\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nIf you look carefully, you will see that this is exactly the same solution we found by variation of parameters, because \\(e^{-P(t)}f(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\).\nSome people find it easier to remember how to use the integrating factor method than variation of parameters. Since ultimately they require the same calculation, you should use whichever of the two you find easier to recall. Using this method, the solution of the previous example would look just a bit different: Starting with \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), we recall that the integrating factor is \\(e^{\\int 3/t}=e^{3\\ln t}=t^{3}\\). Then we multiply through by the integrating factor and solve:\n\n\n",

Since the first parametrization leaves off at \\(t=1\\), we shift the parameter in the second part so it starts at \\(t=1\\). Our current description of the second part starts at \\(t=0\\), so we introduce a 'time delay' of \\(1\\) unit to the second set of parametric equations. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\((t-1)\\) in the second set of parametric equations gives \\(\\left\\{x=3+2(t-1),\\,y=4-4(t-1)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t-1\\leq 1\\right.\\). Simplifying yields \\(\\left\\{x=1+2t,\\,y=8-4t\\,\\text{ for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\).

These two equations completely specify the curve, though the form \\(r=f(\\theta)\\) is simpler. The expanded form has the virtue that it can easily be generalized to describe a wider range of curves than can be specified in rectangular or polar coordinates.\nSuppose \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are functions. Then the equations \\(x=f(t)\\) and \\(y=g(t)\\) describe a curve in the plane. In the case of the polar coordinates equations, the variable \\(t\\) is replaced by \\(\\theta\\) which has a natural geometric interpretation. But \\(t\\) in general is simply an arbitrary variable, often called in this case a **parameter**, and this method of specifying a curve is known as **parametric equations**. One important interpretation of \\(t\\) is _time_. In this interpretation, the equations \\(x=f(t)\\) and \\(y=g(t)\\) give the position of an object at time \\(t\\).\nFigure 10.3.4: An area bounded by the spiral of Archimedes.\n**Example 10.4.1**: _Describe the path of an object that moves so that its position at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(x=\\cos t\\), \\(y=\\cos^{2}t\\). We see immediately that \\(y=x^{2}\\), so the path lies on this parabola. The path is not the entire parabola, however, since \\(x=\\cos t\\) is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). It is now easy to see that the object oscillates back and forth on the parabola between the endpoints \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-1,1)\\), and is at point \\((1,1)\\) at time \\(t=0\\). \\(\\Box\\)_\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. We can parametrize \\(y=x^{2}\\) from \\(x=-1\\) to \\(x=2\\) using the formula given on Page 1053 as \\(\\left\\{x=t,\\,y=t^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-1\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\) This parametrization, however, starts at \\((-1,1)\\) and ends at \\((2,4)\\). Hence, we need to reverse the orientation. To do so, we replace every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\(-t\\) to get \\(\\left\\{x=-t,\\,y=(-t)^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-1\\leq-t\\leq 2\\right.\\) After simplifying, we get \\(\\left\\{x=-t,\\,y=t^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-2\\leq t\\leq 1\\right.\\) We would like \\(t\\) to begin at \\(t=0\\) instead of \\(t=-2\\). The problem here is that the parametrization we have starts \\(2\\) units 'too soon', so we need to introduce a 'time delay' of \\(2\\). Replacing every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\((t-2)\\) gives \\(\\left\\{x=-(t-2),\\,y=(t-2)^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-2\\leq t-2\\leq 1\\right.\\) Simplifying yields \\(\\left\\{x=2-t,\\,y=t^{2}-4t+4\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,0\\leq t\\leq 3\\right.\\)\n2.

We know that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=\\sin(t)\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{ gives a {\\em counter-clockwise} parametrization of the Unit Circle with }t=0\\text{ corresponding to }(1,0)\\), so the first order of business is to reverse the orientation. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\(-t\\) gives \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(-t),\\,y=\\sin(-t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq-t<2\\pi\\right.\\), which simplifies9 to \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-2\\pi<t\\leq 0\\right.\\). This parametrization gives a clockwise orientation, but \\(t=0\\) still corresponds to the point \\((1,0)\\); the point \\((0,-1)\\) is reached when \\(t=-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Our strategy is to first get the parametrization to 'start' at the point \\((0,-1)\\) and then shift the parameter accordingly so the 'start' coincides with \\(t=0\\). We know that any interval of length \\(2\\pi\\) will parametrize the entire circle, so we keep the equations \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{, but start the parameter }t\\text{ at }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\text{, and find the upper bound by adding }2\\pi\\text{ so }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). The reader can verify that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\text{ traces out the Unit Circle clockwise starting at the point }(0,-1)\\). We now shift the parameter by introducing a 'time delay' of \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) units by replacing every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\(\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We get \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right),\\,y=-\\sin\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\right)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right.\\). This simplifies10 to \\(\\left\\{x=-\\sin(t),\\,y=-\\cos(t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{, as required.}\\right.\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### Chapter 13 Vector Functions\nA vector expression of the form \\(\\langle f(t),g(t),h(t)\\rangle\\) is called a **vector function**; it is a function from the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to the set of all three-dimensional vectors. We can alternately think of it as three separate functions, \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\), and \\(z=h(t)\\), that describe points in space. In this case we usually refer to the set of equations as **parametric equations** for the curve, just as for a line. While the parameter \\(t\\) in a vector function might represent any one of a number of physical quantities, or be simply a \"pure number\", it is often convenient and useful to think of \\(t\\) as representing time. The vector function then tells you where in space a particular object is at any time.\nVector functions can be difficult to understand, that is, difficult to picture. When available, computer software can be very helpful. When working by hand, one useful approach is to consider the \"projections\" of the curve onto the three standard coordinate planes. We have already done this in part: in example 13.1.1 we noted that all three curves project to a circle in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, since \\(\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t\\rangle\\) is a two dimensional vector function for the unit circle.\n\n\n",

Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from exercise 13 in section 17.1, \\(\\dot{y}=ky(M-y)\\): \\(y\\) is a population at time \\(t\\), \\(M\\) is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and \\(k\\) measures the reproduction rate of the population. Figure 17.4.4 shows a slope field for this equation\nthat is quite informative. It is apparent that if the initial population is smaller than \\(M\\) it rises to \\(M\\) over the long term, while if the initial population is greater than \\(M\\) it decreases to \\(M\\). It is quite easy to generate slope fields with Sage; follow the AP link in the figure caption.\n##### Exercises 17.4\nIn problems 1-4, compute the Euler approximations for the initial value problem for \\(0\\leq t\\leq 1\\) and \\(\\Delta t=0.2\\). Using Sage, generate the slope field first and attempt to sketch the solution curve. Then use Sage to compute better approximations with smaller values of \\(\\Delta t\\).\n**1.**\\(\\dot{y}=t/y\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**2.**\\(\\dot{y}=t+y^{3}\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**3.**\\(\\dot{y}=\\cos(t+y)\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**4.**\\(\\dot{y}=t\\ln y\\), \\(y(0)=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\nNot all differential equations that are important in practice can be solved exactly, so techniques have been developed to approximate solutions. We describe one such technique, **Euler's Method**, which is simple though not particularly useful compared to some more sophisticated techniques.\nSuppose we wish to approximate a solution to the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\), \\(y(t_{0})=y_{0}\\), for \\(t\\geq t_{0}\\). Under reasonable conditions on \\(\\phi\\), we know the solution exists, represented by a curve in the \\(t\\)-\\(y\\) plane; call this solution \\(f(t)\\). The point \\((t_{0},y_{0})\\) is of course on this curve. We also know the slope of the curve at this point, namely \\(\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\). If we follow the tangent line for a brief distance, we arrive at a point that should be almost on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), namely \\((t_{0}+\\Delta t,y_{0}+\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\Delta t)\\); call this point \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). Now we pretend, in effect, that this point really is on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), in which case we again know the slope of the curve through \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\), namely \\(\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\). So we can compute a new point, \\((t_{2},y_{2})=(t_{1}+\\Delta t,y_{1}+\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\Delta t)\\) that is a little farther along, still close to the graph of \\(f(t)\\) but probably not quite so close as \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). We can continue in this way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have an approximation \\((t_{n},y_{n})\\) for whatever time \\(t_{n}\\) we need.

It is possible to compute a guaranteed\nupper bound on how far off the approximation might be, that is, how far \\(y_{n}\\) is from \\(f(t_{n})\\). Suffice it to say that the bound is not particularly good and that there are other more complicated approximation techniques that do better.\n**EXAMPLE 17.4.3** Let us compute an approximation to the solution for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), when \\(t=1\\). We will use \\(\\Delta t=0.2\\), which is easy to do even by hand, though we should not expect the resulting approximation to be very good. We get\n\\[\\eqalign{(t_{1},y_{1})&=(0+0.2,0+(0-0^{2})0.2)=(0.2,0)\\cr(t_{2},y_{2})&=(0.2+0. 2,0+(0.2-0^{2})0.2)=(0.4,0.04)\\cr(t_{3},y_{3})&=(0.6,0.04+(0.4-0.04^{2})0.2)=( 0.6,0.11968)\\cr(t_{4},y_{4})&=(0.8,0.11968+(0.6-0.11968^{2})0.2)=(0.8,0.2368153 3952)\\cr(t_{5},y_{5})&=(1.0,0.23681533952+(0.6-0.23681533952^{2})0.2)=(1.0,0.38 5599038513605)\\cr}\\]\nSo \\(y(1)\\approx 0.3856\\).

Using the factored form of \\(g(x)\\) above, we find the zeros to be the solutions of \\((2x-5)(x+1)=0\\). We obtain \\(x=\\frac{5}{2}\\) and \\(x=-1\\). Since both of these numbers are in the domain of \\(g\\), we have two \\(x\\)-intercepts, \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, we set \\(x=0\\) and find \\(y=g(0)=\\frac{5}{6}\\), so our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\).\n4. Since \\(g(x)\\) was given to us in lowest terms, we have, once again by Theorem 4.1 vertical asymptotes \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=3\\). Keeping in mind \\(g(x)=\\frac{(2x-5)(x+1)}{(x-3)(x+2)}\\), we proceed to our analysis near each of these values. * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(-9)(-1)}{(-5)(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\]\nso as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). On the flip side, as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to 3\\):_ As \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number just shy of \\(3\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(1)(4)}{(\\text{ very small }(-))(5)}\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{ very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] Hence, as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, we have (again, without labels on the \\(y\\)-axis) 5. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator of \\(g(x)\\) are the same, we know from Theorem 4.2 that we can find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of \\(g\\) by taking the ratio of the leading terms coefficients, \\(y=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\). However, if we take the time to do a more detailed analysis, we will be able to reveal some 'hidden' behavior which would be lost otherwise.11 As in the discussion following Theorem 4.2, we use the result of the long division \\(\\left(2x^{2}-3x-5\\right)\\div\\left(x^{2}-x-6\\right)\\) to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-3x-5}{x^{2}-x-6}\\) as \\(g(x)=2-\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}.\\) We focus our attention on the term \\(\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}\\). Footnote 11: That is, if you use a calculator to graph. Once again, Calculus is the ultimate graphing power tool.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* _The behavior of \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\to 2\\):_ Consider \\(x\\to 2^{-}\\). We imagine substituting \\(x=1.999999\\). Approximating \\(f(x)\\) as we did above, we get \\[f(x)\\approx\\frac{6}{\\left(\\text{very small }(-)\\right)\\left(4\\right)}=\\frac{3}{2 \\left(\\text{very small }(-)\\right)}\\approx\\frac{3}{\\text{very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] We conclude that as \\(x\\to 2^{-}\\), \\(f(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Similarly, as \\(x\\to 2^{+}\\), we imagine substituting \\(x=2.000001\\) to get \\(f(x)\\approx\\frac{3}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\). So as \\(x\\to 2^{+},f(x)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, we have that near \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=2\\) the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) looks like6 Footnote 6: We have deliberately left off the labels on the \\(y\\)-axis because we know only the behavior near \\(x=\\pm 2\\), not the actual function values.\n5. Next, we determine the end behavior of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). Since the degree of the numerator is \\(1\\), and the degree of the denominator is \\(2\\), Theorem 4.2 tells us that \\(y=0\\) is the horizontal asymptote. As with the vertical asymptotes, we can glean more detailed information using 'number sense'. For the discussion below, we use the formula \\(f(x)=\\frac{3x}{x^{2}-4}\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\):_ If we were to make a table of values to discuss the behavior of \\(f\\) as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), we would substitute very 'large' negative numbers in for \\(x\\), say for example, \\(x=-1\\) billion. The numerator \\(3x\\) would then be \\(-3\\) billion, whereas\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n10 & \\(\\approx 485.48\\) \\\\ \\hline\n100 & \\(\\approx 498.50\\) \\\\ \\hline\n1000 & \\(\\approx 499.85\\) \\\\ \\hline\n10000 & \\(\\approx 499.98\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\nThe table suggests that as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(N(t)\\to 500\\). (More specifically, \\(500^{-}\\).) This means as time goes by, only a total of 500 students will have ever had the flu.\nWe close this section with a discussion of the _third_ (and final!) kind of asymptote which can be associated with the graphs of rational functions. Let us return to the function \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-4}{x+1}\\) in Example 4.1.4. Performing long division,12 we get \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-4}{x+1}=x-1-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\). Since the term \\(\\frac{3}{x+1}\\to 0\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), it stands to reason that as \\(x\\) becomes unbounded, the function values \\(g(x)=x-1-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\approx x-1\\). Geometrically, this means that the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) should resemble the line \\(y=x-1\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). We see this play out both numerically and graphically below.\nFootnote 12: See the remarks following Theorem 4.2.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline x&g(x)&x-1\\\\ \\hline-10&\\approx-10.6667&-11\\\\ \\hline-100&\\approx-100.9697&-101\\\\ \\hline-1000&\\approx-1000.9970&-1001\\\\ \\hline-10000&\\approx-10000.9997&-10001\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline x&g(x)&x-1\\\\ \\hline 10&\\approx 8.7273&9\\\\ \\hline 100&\\approx 98.9703&99\\\\ \\hline 1000&\\approx 998.9970&999\\\\ \\hline 10000&\\approx 9998.9997&9999\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline y=g(x)&\\text{and }y=x-1\\\\ \\text{as }x\\to-\\infty&\\text{as }x\\to\\infty\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nThe way we symbolize the relationship between the end behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) with that of the line \\(y=x-1\\) is to write 'as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), \\(g(x)\\to x-1\\).' In this case, we say the line \\(y=x-1\\) is a **slant asymptote**13 to the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). Informally, the graph of a rational function has a slant asymptote if, as \\(x\\to\\infty\\) or as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph resembles a non-horizontal, or 'slanted' line. Formally, we define a slant asymptote as follows.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\n\n",

Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\).

Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true.

It is difficult, and not particularly useful, to express a complete procedure for determining whether this is the case. Generally, the best approach is to gain enough understanding of the shape of the graph to decide. Fortunately, only a rough idea of the shape is usually needed.\nThere are some particularly nice cases that are easy. A continuous function on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\)_always_ has both a global maximum and a global minimum, so examining the critical values and the endpoints is enough:\n**Theorem 6.1.2**Extreme value theorem**  If \\(f\\) is continuous on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\), then it has both a minimum and a maximum point.

There may also be a global minimum in the first case, or a global maximum in the second case, but that will generally require more effort to determine.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Theorem 6.1.2**Extreme value theorem**  If \\(f\\) is continuous on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\), then it has both a minimum and a maximum point.

The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is never zero, but \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=2\\), so we compute \\(f(2)=7\\). Checking the end points we get \\(f(1)=8\\) and \\(f(4)=9\\).

It is simpler, however, simply to remember that we must always check the endpoints.\nSo the function \\(g\\), that is, \\(f\\) restricted to \\([-2,1]\\), has one critical value and two finite endpoints, any of which might be the global maximum or minimum. We could first determine which of these are local maximum or minimum points (or neither); then the largest local maximum must be the global maximum and the smallest local minimum must be the global minimum. It is usually easier, however, to compute the value of \\(f\\) at every point at which the global maximum or minimum might occur; the largest of these is the global maximum, the smallest is the global minimum.\nSo we compute \\(f(-2)=4\\), \\(f(0)=0\\), \\(f(1)=1\\).

It is at this point that we will need to know whether \\(y\\) is \\(U(x)\\) or \\(L(x)\\). Occasionally it will turn out that we can avoid explicit use of \\(U(x)\\) or \\(L(x)\\) by the nature of the problem.\n**EXAMPLE 4.8.1** Find the slope of the circle \\(4=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) at the point \\((1,-\\sqrt{3})\\). Since we know both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of the point of interest, we do not need to explicitly recognize that this point is on \\(L(x)\\), and we do not need to use \\(L(x)\\) to compute \\(y\\)--but we could.

There are a handful of algebraic tricks that work on many of these limits.\n**Example 2.3.8**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x^{2}+2x-3}{x-1}\\). We can't simply plug in \\(x=1\\) because that makes the denominator zero. However:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x^{2}+2x-3}{x-1}&=\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{(x-1)(x+3)}{x-1} \\cr&=\\lim_{x\\to 1}(x+3)=4\\cr}\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nWhile theorem 2.3.6 is very helpful, we need a bit more to work easily with limits. Since the theorem applies when some limits are already known, we need to know the behavior of some functions that cannot themselves be constructed from the simple arithmetic operations of the theorem, such as \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Also, there is one other extraordinarily useful way to put functions together: composition. If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are functions, we can form two functions by composition: \\(f(g(x))\\) and \\(g(f(x))\\). For example, if \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}+5\\), then \\(f(g(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}+5}\\) and \\(g(f(x))=(\\sqrt{x})^{2}+5=x+5\\). Here is a companion to theorem 2.3.6 for composition:\n**Theorem 2.3.9**: Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=f(L)\\). Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a}f(g(x))=f(L).\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nNote the special form of the condition on \\(f\\): it is not enough to know that \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=M\\), though it is a bit tricky to see why.

This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\n\n",

To minimize propagation of error, however, we could use the Law of Cosines again,4 in this case using \\(\\cos(\\gamma)=\\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab}\\). Plugging in \\(a=7\\), \\(b=\\sqrt{53-28\\cos\\left(50^{\\circ}\\right)}\\) and \\(c=2\\), we get \\(\\gamma=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{7-2\\cos(50^{\\circ})}{\\sqrt{53-28\\cos(50^{\\circ})}}\\right)\\) radians \\(\\approx 15.01^{\\circ}\\). We sketch the triangle below.\nFootnote 4: Your instructor will let you know which procedure to use. It all boils down to how much you trust your calculator.\nAs we mentioned earlier, once we've determined \\(b\\) it is possible to use the Law of Sines to find the remaining angles. Here, however, we must proceed with caution as we are in the ambiguous (ASS) case. It is advisable to first find the _smallest_ of the unknown angles, since we are guaranteed it will be acute.5 In this case, we would find \\(\\gamma\\) since the side opposite \\(\\gamma\\) is smaller than the side opposite the other unknown angle, \\(\\alpha\\). Using the angle-side opposite pair \\((\\beta,b)\\), we get \\(\\frac{\\sin(\\gamma)}{2}=\\frac{\\sin(50^{\\circ})}{\\sqrt{53-28\\cos(50^{\\circ})}}\\). The usual calculations produces \\(\\gamma\\approx 15.01^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\alpha=180^{\\circ}-\\beta-\\gamma\\approx 180^{\\circ}-50^{\\circ}-15.01^{\\circ}=114.99 ^{\\circ}\\).

First, we compute \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=3x^{2}-1\\) and \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=6x\\). Since \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(0)=0\\), there is potentially an inflection point at zero. Since \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)>0\\) when \\(x>0\\) and \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)<0\\) when \\(x<0\\) the concavity does change from down to up at zero, and the curve is concave down for all \\(x<0\\) and concave up for all \\(x>0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nNote that we need to compute and analyze the second derivative to understand concavity, so we may as well try to use the second derivative test for maxima and minima. If for some reason this fails we can then try one of the other tests.\n#### Exercises 5.4.\nDescribe the concavity of the functions in 1-18.\n1. \\(y=x^{2}-x\\Rightarrow\\)\n2. \\(y=x^{3}-9x^{2}+24x\\Rightarrow\\)\n3. \\(y=3x^{4}-4x^{3}\\Rightarrow\\)\n4. \\(y=3x^{2}-(1/x^{2})\\Rightarrow\\)\n5. \\(y=4x+\\sqrt{1-x}\\Rightarrow\\)\n6. \\(y=x^{5}-x\\Rightarrow\\)\n7. \\(y=x+1/x\\Rightarrow\\)\n8. \\(y=x+5^{1/4}\\Rightarrow\\)\n9. \\(y=\\cos^{2}x-\\sin^{2}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n10. \\(y=\\cos^{2}x-\\sin^{2}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. \\(y=\\sin^{3}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n12. \\(y=\\sin^{3}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n13. \\(y=\\sin^{3}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n14. \\(y=x^{2}+1/x\\Rightarrow\\)\n15. \\(y=\\sin^{3}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n16. \\(y=\\sin^{3}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n17. \\(y=\\sin^{3}x\\Rightarrow\\)\n19.

To find how long it takes until 4200 people have heard the rumor, we set \\(N(t)=42\\). Solving \\(\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-t}}=42\\) gives \\(t=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\). It takes around 8 days until 4200 people have heard the rumor.\n4. We graph \\(y=N(x)\\) using the calculator and see that the line \\(y=84\\) is the horizontal asymptote of the graph, confirming our answer to part 2, and the graph intersects the line \\(y=42\\) at \\(x=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\), which confirms our answer to part 3.\nIf we take the time to analyze the graph of \\(y=N(x)\\) above, we can see graphically how logistic growth combines features of uninhibited and limited growth. The curve seems to rise steeply, then at some point, begins to level off. The point at which this happens is called an **inflection point** or is sometimes called the 'point of diminishing returns'. At this point, even though the function is still increasing, the rate at which it does so begins to decline. It turns out the point of diminishing returns always occurs at half the limiting population. (In our case, when \\(y=42\\).) While these concepts are more precisely quantified using Calculus, below are two views of the graph of \\(y=N(x)\\), one on the interval \\([0,8]\\), the other on \\([8,15]\\). The former looks strikingly like uninhibited growth; the latter like limited growth.\n\\(y=f(x)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-x}}\\) for \\(0\\leq x\\leq 8\\)\\(y=f(x)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-x}}\\) for \\(8\\leq x\\leq 16\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nand \\(b\\). We have not previously considered such points because we have not been interested in limiting a function to a small interval. An example should make this clear.\nFind the maximum and minimum values of \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) on the interval \\([-2,1]\\), shown in figure 6.1.1. We compute \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=2x\\), which is zero at \\(x=0\\) and is always defined.\nSince \\(f^{\\prime}(1)=2\\) we would not normally flag \\(x=1\\) as a point of interest, but it is clear from the graph that _when \\(f(x)\\) is restricted to \\([-2,1]\\) there is a local maximum at \\(x=1\\)_. Likewise we would not normally pay attention to \\(x=-2\\), but since we have truncated \\(f\\) at \\(-2\\) we have introduced a new local maximum there as well. In a technical sense nothing new is going on here: When we truncate \\(f\\) we actually create a new function, let's call it \\(g\\), that is defined only on the interval \\([-2,1]\\). If we try to compute the derivative of this new function we actually find that it does not have a derivative at \\(-2\\) or \\(1\\). Why? Because to compute the derivative at \\(1\\) we must compute the limit\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{g(1+\\Delta x)-g(1)\\over\\Delta x}.\\]\nThis limit does not exist because when \\(\\Delta x>0\\), \\(g(1+\\Delta x)\\) is not defined. It is simpler, however, simply to remember that we must always check the endpoints.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nIn Exercises 1 - 15, use the property: \\(b^{a}=c\\) if and only if \\(\\log_{b}(c)=a\\) from Theorem 6.2 to rewrite the given equation in the other form.

The highest curvature occurs where the curve has its highest and lowest points, and indeed in the picture these appear to be the most sharply curved portions of the curve, while the curve is almost a straight line midway between those points. \\(\\Box\\)\nLet's see why this alternate formula is correct. Starting with the definition of \\({\\bf T}\\), \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}\\) so by the product rule \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime\\prime}{\\bf T}+|{\\bf r}^{ \\prime}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}\\). Then by Theorem 12.4.2 the cross product is\n\\[\\eqalign{{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\times{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T }\\times(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime}{\\bf T}+|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}) \\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}\\times|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime\\prime}{\\bf T}+| {\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}\\times|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{ \\prime}||{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime}({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T})+|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{ 2}({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T}^{\\prime})\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{2}({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T }^{\\prime})\\cr}\\]\nbecause \\({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T}={\\bf 0}\\), since \\({\\bf T}\\) is parallel to itself. Then\n\\[\\eqalign{|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\times{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}|&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{ 2}|{\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{2}|{\\bf T}||{\\bf T}^{ \\prime}|\\sin\\theta\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{2}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\cr}\\]\nusing exercise 8 in section 13.2 to see that \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\). Dividing both sides by \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{3}\\) then gives the desired formula.\nWe used the fact here that \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}\\) is perpendicular to \\({\\bf T}\\); the vector \\({\\bf N}={\\bf T}^{\\prime}/|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\) is thus a unit vector perpendicular to \\({\\bf T}\\), called the **unit normal** to the curve. Occasionally of use is the **unit binormal**\\({\\bf B}={\\bf T}\\times{\\bf N}\\), a unit vector perpendicular to both \\({\\bf T}\\) and \\({\\bf N}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this chapter we will discuss the properties of the tangent plane.\nIn this chapter we will discuss the properties of the tangent plane.\nof the \\(z\\) component to the \\(x\\) component is the slope of the tangent line, precisely what we know how to compute. The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\). This point is on the upper hemisphere, so we use \\(f(x,y)=\\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\). Then \\(f_{x}(x,y)=-x(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\) and \\(f_{y}(x,y)=-y(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\), so \\(f_{x}(1,1)=f_{y}(1,1)=-1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and the equation of the plane is\n\\[z=-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(x-1)-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(y-1)+\\sqrt{2}.\\]\nThe hemisphere and this tangent plane are pictured in figure 14.3.3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it appears that to find a tangent plane, we need only find two quite simple ordinary derivatives, namely \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\). This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Example 13.4.2**: Suppose \\({\\bf r}=\\langle t,t^{2},t^{3}\\rangle\\).

Geometrically, this is because there are no jumps in the graphs. That is, if you pick a point on the graph and approach it from the left and right, the values of the function approach the value of the function at that point. For example, we can see that this is not true for function values near \\(x=-1\\) on the graph in (a) which is not continuous at that location.\nFigure 2.5.1: Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c) a bounded, differentiable function, (d) an unbounded, differentiable function\n**Definition 2.5.2**: **Continuous at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.3**: **Continuous** A function \\(f\\) is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. \\(\\Box\\)\nStrangely, we also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Continuity.** The graphs shown in (b) and (c) both represent **continuous** functions.

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\n\n",

As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\).

By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function.

If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFigure 15.1.1: A rectangular subdivision of \\([a,b]\\times[c,d]\\).\nmore \"generic\" than writing \\(dx\\,dy\\). The average height of the surface in this notation is\n\\[\\frac{1}{(b-a)(d-c)}\\iint_{R}f(x,y)\\,dA.\\]\nThe next question, of course, is: How do we compute these double integrals? You might think that we will need some two-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but as it turns out we can get away with just the single variable version, applied twice.\nGoing back to the double sum, we can rewrite it to emphasize a particular order in which we want to add the terms:\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x\\right)\\Delta y.\\]\nIn the sum in parentheses, only the value of \\(x_{j}\\) is changing; \\(y_{i}\\) is temporarily constant. As \\(m\\) goes to infinity, this sum has the right form to turn into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x=\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y_{i}) \\,dx.\\]\nSo after we take the limit as \\(m\\) goes to infinity, the sum is\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y_{i})\\,dx\\right)\\Delta y.\\]\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface.\n### Chapter 15 Multiple Integration\nOf course, for different values of \\(y_{i}\\) this integral has different values; in other words, it is really a function applied to \\(y_{i}\\):\n\\[G(y)=\\int_{a}^{b}f(x,y)\\,dx.\\]\nIf we substitute back into the sum we get\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}G(y_{i})\\Delta y.\\]\nThis sum has a nice interpretation. The value \\(G(y_{i})\\) is the area of a cross section of the region under the surface \\(f(x,y)\\), namely, when \\(y=y_{i}\\). The quantity \\(G(y_{i})\\Delta y\\) can be interpreted as the volume of a solid with face area \\(G(y_{i})\\) and thickness \\(\\Delta y\\). Think of the surface \\(f(x,y)\\) as the top of a loaf of sliced bread. Each slice has a cross-sectional area and a thickness; \\(G(y_{i})\\Delta y\\) corresponds to the volume of a single slice of bread. Adding these up approximates the total volume of the loaf. (This is very similar to the technique we used to compute volumes in section 9.3, except that there we need the cross-sections to be in some way \"the same\".) Figure 15.1.3 shows this \"sliced loaf\" approximation using the same surface as shown in figure 15.1.2. Nicely enough, this sum looks just like the sort of sum that turns into an integral, namely,\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n\n\n",

Like many things in life, there is no short-cut here - there is no complete algorithm for verifying identities. Nevertheless, a summary of some strategies which may be helpful (depending on the situation) is provided below and ample practice is provided for you in the Exercises.\n**Strategies for Verifying Identities**\n* Try working on the more complicated side of the identity.\n* Use the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities in Theorem 10.6 to write functions on one side of the identity in terms of the functions on the other side of the identity. Simplify the resulting complex fractions.\n* Add rational expressions with unlike denominators by obtaining common denominators.\n* Use the Pythagorean Identities in Theorem 10.8 to 'exchange' sines and cosines, secants and tangents, cosecants and cotangents, and simplify sums or differences of squares to one term.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n6. To begin, we rewrite \\(4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)>\\pi\\) as \\(4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi>0\\). We let \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi\\), and note the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). To find the zeros of \\(f\\), we set \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi=0\\) and solve. We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), and since \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arccotangent, we may apply Theorem 10.27 and solve \\[\\operatorname{arccot}(3x) = \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[3x = 1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\operatorname{cot}( \\operatorname{arccot}(u))=u.\\] \\[x = \\tfrac{1}{3}\\] Next, we make a sign diagram for \\(f\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, and there is only one zero of \\(f\\), \\(x=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we have two test intervals, \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\infty\\right)\\). Ideally, we wish to find test values \\(x\\) in these intervals so that \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(4x)\\) corresponds to one of our off-used 'common' angles. After a bit of computation,18 we choose \\(x=0\\) for \\(x<\\frac{1}{3}\\) and for \\(x>\\frac{1}{3}\\), we choose \\(x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). We find \\(f(0)=\\pi>0\\) and \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{3}<0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi>0\\), we get our answer \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\). To check graphically, we use the technique in number 2c of Example 10.6.5 in Section 10.6 to graph \\(y=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)\\) and we see it is above the horizontal line \\(y=\\pi\\) on \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\left(-\\infty,0.\\overline{3}\\right)\\).\nFootnote 18: Set \\(3x\\) equal to the cotangents of the ‘common angles’ and choose accordingly.\n#### Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 18, find all of the exact solutions of the equation and then list those solutions which are in the interval \\(\\left[0,2\\pi\\right)\\).\n1. \\(\\sin\\left(5x\\right)=0\\) \\(2.\\)\\(\\cos\\left(3x\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) \\(3.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(-2x\\right)=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\tan\\left(6x\\right)=1\\) \\(5.\\)\\(\\csc\\left(4x\\right)=-1\\) \\(6.\\)\\(\\sec\\left(3x\\right)=\\sqrt{2}\\)\n3. \\(\\cot\\left(2x\\right)=-\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) \\(8.\\)\\(\\cos\\left(9x\\right)=9\\) \\(9.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{x}{3}\\right)=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n4. \\(\\cos\\left(x+\\dfrac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)=0\\) \\(11.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(2x-\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) \\(12.\\)\\(2\\cos\\left(x+\\dfrac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\sqrt{3}\\)\n5. \\(\\csc(x)=0\\) \\(14.\\)\\(\\tan\\left(2x-\\pi\\right)=1\\) \\(15.\\)\\(\\tan^{2}\\left(x\\right)=3\\)\n6. \\(\\sec^{2}\\left(x\\right)=\\dfrac{4}{3}\\) \\(17.\\)\\(\\cos^{2}\\left(x\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) \\(18.\\)\\(\\sin^{2}\\left(x\\right)=\\dfrac{3}{4}\\)\nIn Exercises 19 - 42, solve the equation, giving the exact solutions which lie in \\(\\left[0,2\\pi\\right)\\)\n19. \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(21.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(2x\\right)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(22.\\)\\(\\cos\\left(2x\\right)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\)\n23. \\(\\cos\\left(2x\\right)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(24.\\)\\(\\cos(2x)=2-5\\cos(x)\\)\n26. \\(\\cos(2x)=5\\sin(x)-2\\)\n28. \\(2\\sec^{2}(x)=3-\\tan(x)\\)\n30. \\(\\cot^{2}(x)=3\\csc(x)-3\\)\n32. \\(\\cos(x)\\csc(x)\\cot(x)=6-\\cot^{2}(x)\\)\n34. \\(\\cot^{4}(x)=4\\csc^{2}(x)-7\\)\n36. \\(\\tan^{3}\\left(x\\right)=3\\tan\\left(x\\right)\\)\n38. \\(\\cos^{3}\\left(x\\right)=-\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\)\n40. \\(\\csc^{3}(x)+\\csc^{2}(x)=4\\csc(x)+4\\)\n42. \\(\\tan\\left(x\\right)=\\sec\\left(x\\right)\\)\nIn Exercises 43 - 58, solve the equation, giving the exact solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\)\n1. \\(\\sin(6x)\\cos(x)=-\\cos(6x)\\sin(x)\\) 1. \\(\\sin(3x)\\cos(x)=\\cos(3x)\\sin(x)\\)\n2. \\(\\cos(2x)\\cos(x)+\\sin(2x)\\sin(x)=1\\) 2. \\(\\sin(x)+\\cos(x)=1\\) 3. \\(\\sqrt{2}\\cos(x)-\\sqrt{2}\\sin(x)=1\\) 4. \\(\\cos(2x)-\\sqrt{3}\\sin(2x)=\\sqrt{2}\\) 4. \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\) 5. \\(\\sin(5x)=\\sin(3x)\\) 5. \\(\\sin(6x)+\\sin(x)=0\\)\nIn Exercises 59 - 68, solve the equation.\n1. \\(\\arccos(2x)=\\pi\\)\n2. \\(4\\arctan(3x-1)-\\pi=0\\)\n3. \\(4\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi\\)\n4. \\(9\\arcsin^{2}(x)-\\pi^{2}=0\\)\n5. \\(8\\arccos^{2}(x)+3\\pi^{2}=10\\pi\\arccos(x)\\)\nIn Exercises 69 - 80, solve the inequality. Express the exact answer in interval notation, restricting your attention to \\(0\\leq x\\leq 2\\pi\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nA few remarks about Example 10.6.1 are in order. Most of the common errors encountered in dealing with the inverse circular functions come from the need to restrict the domains of the original functions so that they are one-to-one. One instance of this phenomenon is the fact that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) as opposed to \\(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\). This is the exact same phenomenon discussed in Section 5.2 when we saw \\(\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}}=2\\) as opposed to \\(-2\\). Additionally, even though the expression we arrived at in part 2b above, namely \\(1-2x^{2}\\), is defined for all real numbers, the equivalence \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=1-2x^{2}\\) is valid for only \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). This is akin to the fact that while the expression \\(x\\) is defined for all real numbers, the equivalence \\(\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^{2}=x\\) is valid only for \\(x\\geq 0\\). For this reason, it pays to be careful when we determine the intervals where such equivalences are valid.\nThe next pair of functions we wish to discuss are the inverses of tangent and cotangent, which are named arctangent and arccotangent, respectively. First, we restrict \\(f(x)=\\tan(x)\\) to its fundamental cycle on \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) to obtain \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\arctan(x)\\). Among other things, note that the _vertical_ asymptotes \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) of the graph of \\(f(x)=\\tan(x)\\) become the _horizontal_ asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) of the graph of \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\arctan(x)\\).\nNext, we restrict \\(g(x)=\\cot(x)\\) to its fundamental cycle on \\((0,\\pi)\\) to obtain \\(g^{-1}(x)=\\arccot(x)\\). Once again, the vertical asymptotes \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) of the graph of \\(g(x)=\\cot(x)\\) become the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\) of the graph of \\(g^{-1}(x)=\\arccot(x)\\). We show these graphs on the next page and list some of the basic properties of the arctangent and arccotangent functions.\n**Theorem 10.27**.: **Properties of the Arctangent and Arccotangent Functions**\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIn Example 10.3.3 number 6 above, we see that multiplying \\(1-\\cos(\\theta)\\) by \\(1+\\cos(\\theta)\\) produces a difference of squares that can be simplified to one term using Theorem 10.8. This is exactly the same kind of phenomenon that occurs when we multiply expressions such as \\(1-\\sqrt{2}\\) by \\(1+\\sqrt{2}\\) or \\(3-4i\\) by \\(3+4i\\). (Can you recall instances from Algebra where we did such things?) For this reason, the quantities \\((1-\\cos(\\theta))\\) and \\((1+\\cos(\\theta))\\) are called 'Pythagorean Conjugates.'

As with rectangular coordinates, we can adapt the method to deal with more complicated regions.\n**Example 15.2.2** Find the volume under \\(z=\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\) above the region enclosed by the curve \\(r=2\\cos\\theta\\), \\(-\\pi/2\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi/2\\); see figure 15.2.2. The region is described in polar coordinates by the inequalities \\(-\\pi/2\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi/2\\) and \\(0\\leq r\\leq 2\\cos\\theta\\), so the double integral is\n\\[\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{2\\cos\\theta}\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\ r\\,dr\\,d\\theta=2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{2\\cos\\theta}\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\ r\\,dr\\,d\\theta.\\]\nWe can rewrite the integral as shown because of the symmetry of the volume; this avoids a complication during the evaluation. Proceeding:\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the interior of the unit circle. This is still not an easy integral, but it is easily transformed to polar coordinates, and then easily integrated. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 15.7.5**\\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\)\nThere is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals, though it is a bit more difficult to derive. Suppose we use three substitution functions, \\(x=f(u,v,w)\\), \\(y=g(u,v,w)\\), and \\(z=h(u,v,w)\\). The Jacobian determinant is now\n\\[\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u,v,w)}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}f_{u}&g_{u}&h _{u}\\\\ f_{v}&g_{v}&h_{v}\\\\ f_{w}&g_{w}&h_{w}\\end{array}\\right|.\\]\nThen the integral is transformed in a similar fashion:\n\\[\\int\\!\\int\\!\\int_{R}F(x,y,z)\\,dV=\\int\\!\\int\\!\\int_{S}F(f(u,v,w),g(u,v,w),h(u,v,w ))\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u,v,w)}\\right|\\,du\\,dv\\,dw,\\]\nwhere of course the region \\(S\\) in \\(uvw\\) space corresponds to the region \\(R\\) in \\(xyz\\) space.\nExercises 15.7.:\n1. Complete example 15.7.1 by converting to polar coordinates and evaluating the integral. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n2. When parameterizing line segments, we think: 'starting point \\(+\\) (displacement)\\(t\\)'. For the first part of the path, we get \\(\\left\\{x=3t,\\,y=4t\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\right.\\), and for the second part we get \\(\\left\\{x=3+2t,\\,y=4-4t\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\right.\\). Since the first parametrization leaves off at \\(t=1\\), we shift the parameter in the second part so it starts at \\(t=1\\). Our current description of the second part starts at \\(t=0\\), so we introduce a 'time delay' of \\(1\\) unit to the second set of parametric equations. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\((t-1)\\) in the second set of parametric equations gives \\(\\left\\{x=3+2(t-1),\\,y=4-4(t-1)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t-1\\leq 1\\right.\\). Simplifying yields \\(\\left\\{x=1+2t,\\,y=8-4t\\,\\text{ for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\). Hence, we may parametrize the path as \\(\\left\\{x=f(t),\\,y=g(t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\) where \\[f(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}3t,&\\text{for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\\\ 1+2t,&\\text{for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\end{array}\\right.\\text{ and }\\;g(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}4t,&\\text{for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\\\ 8-4t,&\\text{for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n3. We know that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=\\sin(t)\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{ gives a {\\em counter-clockwise} parametrization of the Unit Circle with }t=0\\text{ corresponding to }(1,0)\\), so the first order of business is to reverse the orientation. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\(-t\\) gives \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(-t),\\,y=\\sin(-t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq-t<2\\pi\\right.\\), which simplifies9 to \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-2\\pi<t\\leq 0\\right.\\). This parametrization gives a clockwise orientation, but \\(t=0\\) still corresponds to the point \\((1,0)\\); the point \\((0,-1)\\) is reached when \\(t=-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Our strategy is to first get the parametrization to 'start' at the point \\((0,-1)\\) and then shift the parameter accordingly so the 'start' coincides with \\(t=0\\). We know that any interval of length \\(2\\pi\\) will parametrize the entire circle, so we keep the equations \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{, but start the parameter }t\\text{ at }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\text{, and find the upper bound by adding }2\\pi\\text{ so }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). The reader can verify that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\text{ traces out the Unit Circle clockwise starting at the point }(0,-1)\\). We now shift the parameter by introducing a 'time delay' of \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) units by replacing every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\(\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We get \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right),\\,y=-\\sin\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\right)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right.\\). This simplifies10 to \\(\\left\\{x=-\\sin(t),\\,y=-\\cos(t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{, as required.}\\right.\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 15.2 Double Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates\n**33.**: What are the parallels between Fubini's Theorem and Clairaut's Theorem (14.6.2)?\n### 15.2 Double Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates\nSuppose we have a surface given in cylindrical coordinates as \\(z=f(r,\\theta)\\) and we wish to find the integral over some region. We could attempt to translate into rectangular coordinates and do the integration there, but it is often easier to stay in cylindrical coordinates.\nHow might we approximate the volume under such a surface in a way that uses cylindrical coordinates directly? The basic idea is the same as before: we divide the region into many small regions, multiply the area of each small region by the height of the surface somewhere in that little region, and add them up. What changes is the shape of the small regions; in order to have a nice representation in terms of \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), we use small pieces of ring-shaped areas, as shown in figure 15.2.1. Each small region is roughly rectangular, except that two sides are segments of a circle and the other two sides are not quite parallel. Near a point \\((r,\\theta)\\), the length of either circular arc is about \\(r\\Delta\\theta\\) and the length of each straight side is simply \\(\\Delta r\\). When \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are very small, the region is nearly a rectangle with area \\(r\\Delta r\\Delta\\theta\\), and the volume under the surface is approximately\n\n\n",

This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\).

To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\).

In the case of functions of two variables, things are a bit harder to understand. If we think of a function of two variables in terms of its graph, a surface, there is a more-or-less obvious derivative-like question we might ask, namely, how \"steep\" is the surface. But it's not clear that this has a simple answer, nor how we might proceed. We will start with what seem to be very small steps toward the goal; surprisingly, it turns out that these simple ideas hold the keys to a more general understanding.\nImagine a particular point on a surface; what might we be able to say about how steep it is? We can limit the question to make it more familiar: how steep is the surface in a particular direction? What does this even mean? Here's one way to think of it: Suppose we're interested in the point \\((a,b,c)\\). Pick a straight line in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane through the point \\((a,b,0)\\), then extend the line vertically into a plane. Look at the intersection of the\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nthe integrand \\(|{\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\) is the area of a tiny parallelogram, that is, a very small surface area, so it is reasonable to abbreviate it \\(dS\\); then a shortened version of the integral is\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\cdot dS.\\]\nWe have already seen that if \\(D\\) is a region in the plane, the area of \\(D\\) may be computed with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\cdot dA,\\]\nso this is really quite familiar, but the \\(dS\\) hides a little more detail than does \\(dA\\).\nJust as we can integrate functions \\(f(x,y)\\) over regions in the plane, using\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}f(x,y)\\,dA,\\]\nso we can compute integrals over surfaces in space, using\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}f(x,y,z)\\,dS.\\]\nIn practice this means that we have a vector function \\({\\bf r}(u,v)=\\langle x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)\\rangle\\) for the surface, and the integral we compute is\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))|{\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}| \\,du\\,dv.\\]\nThat is, we express everything in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), and then we can do an ordinary double integral.\n##### Example 16.7.1\nSuppose a thin object occupies the upper hemisphere of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1\\) and has density \\(\\sigma(x,y,z)=z\\). Find the mass and center of mass of the object. (Note that the object is just a thin shell; it does not occupy the interior of the hemisphere.)\nWe write the hemisphere as \\({\\bf r}(\\phi,\\theta)=\\langle\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\phi\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq\\phi\\leq\\pi/2\\) and \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi\\).

(AP)\nFigure 16.6.2: Tracing a surface. (AP)\nWe have previously examined surfaces given in the form \\(f(x,y)\\). It is sometimes useful to represent such surfaces in the more general vector form, which is quite easy: \\({\\bf r}(u,v)=\\langle u,v,f(u,v)\\rangle\\). The names of the variables are not important of course; instead of disguising \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we could simply write \\({\\bf r}(x,y)=\\langle x,y,f(x,y)\\rangle\\).\nWe have also previously dealt with surfaces that are not functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\); many of these are easy to represent in vector form. One common type of surface that cannot be represented as \\(z=f(x,y)\\) is a surface given by an equation involving only \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For example, \\(x+y=1\\) and \\(y=x^{2}\\) are \"vertical\" surfaces. For every point \\((x,y)\\) in the plane that satisfies the equation, the point \\((x,y,z)\\) is on the surface, for every value of \\(z\\). Thus, a corresponding vector form for the surface is something like \\(\\langle f(u),g(u),v\\rangle\\); for example, \\(x+y=1\\) becomes \\(\\langle u,1-u,v\\rangle\\) and \\(y=x^{2}\\) becomes \\(\\langle u,u^{2},v\\rangle\\).\nYet another sort of example is the sphere, say \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1\\). This cannot be written in the form \\(z=f(x,y)\\), but it is easy to write in vector form; indeed this particular surface is much like the cone, since it has circular cross-sections, or we can think of it as a tube around a portion of the \\(z\\)-axis, with a radius that varies depending on where along the axis we are. One vector expression for the sphere is \\(\\langle\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}\\cos u,\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}\\sin u,v\\rangle\\)--this emphasizes the tube structure, as it is naturally viewed as drawing a circle of radius \\(\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}\\) around the \\(z\\)-axis at height \\(v\\). We could also take a cue from spherical coordinates, and write \\(\\langle\\sin u\\cos v,\\sin u\\sin v,\\cos u\\rangle\\), where in effect \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\theta\\) in disguise.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### Vector Functions for Surfaces\nWe have dealt extensively with vector equations for curves, \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\\rangle\\). A similar technique can be used to represent surfaces in a way that is more general than the equations for surfaces we have used so far. Recall that when we use \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\) to represent a curve, we imagine the vector \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\) with its tail at the origin, and then we follow the head of the arrow as \\(t\\) changes. The vector \"draws\" the curve through space as \\(t\\) varies.\nSuppose we instead have a vector function of two variables,\n\\[\\mathbf{r}(u,v)=\\langle x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)\\rangle.\\]\nAs both \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) vary, we again imagine the vector \\(\\mathbf{r}(u,v)\\) with its tail at the origin, and its head sweeps out a surface in space. A useful analogy is the technology of CRT video screens, in which an electron gun fires electrons in the direction of the screen. The gun's direction sweeps horizontally and vertically to \"paint\" the screen with the desired image. In practice, the gun moves horizontally through an entire line, then moves vertically to the next line and repeats the operation. In the same way, it can be useful to imagine fixing a\nvalue of \\(v\\) and letting \\({\\bf r}(u,v)\\) sweep out a curve as \\(u\\) changes. Then \\(v\\) can change a bit, and \\({\\bf r}(u,v)\\) sweeps out a new curve very close to the first. Put enough of these curves together and they form a surface.\n\n\n",

The reason for this lies in the second to last step when we simplified the formula for \\(h(x)\\) in Example 4.1.1, where we had \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\). The reason \\(x=-1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) is because the factor \\((x+1)\\) appears in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\); similarly, \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) because of the factor \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\). The major difference between these two factors is that \\((x-1)\\) cancels with a factor in the numerator whereas \\((x+1)\\) does not. Loosely speaking, the trouble caused by \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator is canceled away while the factor \\((x+1)\\) remains to cause mischief. This is why the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) but only a hole at \\(x=1\\). These observations are generalized and summarized in the theorem below, whose proof is found in Calculus.\n**Theorem 4.1**.: **Location of Vertical Asymptotes and Holes:**_a_ Suppose \\(r\\) is a rational function which can be written as \\(r(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have no common zeros.b Let \\(c\\) be a real number which is not in the domain of \\(r\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nthe \\(x\\)-axis at \\((-1,0)\\). It should make you uncomfortable plugging \\(x=-1\\) into the reduced formula for \\(h(x)\\), especially since we've made such a big deal concerning the stipulation about not letting \\(x=-1\\) for that formula. What we are really doing is taking a Calculus short-cut to the more detailed kind of analysis near \\(x=-1\\) which we will show below. Speaking of which, for the discussion that follows, we will use the formula \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}\\), \\(x\\neq-1\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=h(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\).

For now, we want to move on to some classic applications of function arithmetic from Economics and for that, we need to think like an entrepreneur.3\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. Our goal is to express the function \\(F\\) as \\(F=g\\circ f\\) for functions \\(g\\) and \\(f\\). From Definition 5.1, we know \\(F(x)=g(f(x))\\), and we can think of \\(f(x)\\) as being the 'inside' function and \\(g\\) as being the 'outside' function. Looking at \\(F(x)=|3x-1|\\) from an 'inside versus outside' perspective, we can think of \\(3x-1\\) being inside the absolute value symbols. Taking this cue, we define \\(f(x)=3x-1\\). At this point, we have \\(F(x)=|f(x)|\\). What is the outside function? The function which takes the absolute value of its input, \\(g(x)=|x|\\). Sure enough, \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=|f(x)|=|3x-1|=F(x)\\), so we are done.\n2. We attack deconstructing \\(G\\) from an operational approach. Given an input \\(x\\), the first step is to square \\(x\\), then add \\(1\\), then divide the result into \\(2\\). We will assign each of these steps a function so as to write \\(G\\) as a composite of three functions: \\(f\\), \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). Our first function, \\(f\\), is the function that squares its input, \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). The next function is the function that adds \\(1\\) to its input, \\(g(x)=x+1\\). Our last function takes its input and divides it into \\(2\\), \\(h(x)=\\frac{2}{x}\\). The claim is that \\(G=h\\circ g\\circ f\\). We find \\[(h\\circ g\\circ f)(x)=h(g(f(x)))=h(g\\left(x^{2}\\right))=h\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) =\\frac{2}{x^{2}+1}=G(x),\\] so we are done.\n3. If we look \\(H(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}\\) with an eye towards building a complicated function from simpler functions, we see the expression \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is a simple piece of the larger function. If we define \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we have \\(H(x)=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}\\). If we want to decompose \\(H=g\\circ f\\), then we can glean the formula for \\(g(x)\\) by looking at what is being done to \\(f(x)\\). We take \\(g(x)=\\frac{x+1}{x-1}\\), so \\[(g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}=H(x),\\] as required.\n### 5.1 Function Composition\n\n\n",

We would certainly prefer to have \\(y^{\\prime}\\) written in terms of \\(x\\), and as in the case of \\(\\ln x\\) we can actually do that here. Since \\(\\sin^{2}y+\\cos^{2}y=1\\), \\(\\cos^{2}y=1-\\sin^{2}y=1-x^{2}\\). So \\(\\cos y=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) , but which is it--plus or minus? It could in general be either, but this isn't \"in general\": since \\(y=\\arcsin(x)\\) we know that \\(-\\pi/2\\leq y\\leq\\pi/2\\), and the cosine of an angle in this interval is always positive. Thus \\(\\cos y=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) and\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\arcsin(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}.\\]\nNote that this agrees with figure 4.9.1: the graph of the arcsine has positive slope everywhere.\nWe can do something similar for the cosine. As with the sine, we must first truncate the cosine so that it can be inverted, as shown in figure 4.9.2. Then we use implicit\n### Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions\ndifferentiation to find that\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\arccos(x)=\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}.\\]\nNote that the truncated cosine uses a different interval than the truncated sine, so that if \\(y=\\arccos(x)\\) we know that \\(0\\leq y\\leq\\pi\\). The computation of the derivative of the arccosine is left as an exercise.\nFinally we look at the tangent; the other trigonometric functions also have \"partial inverses\" but the sine, cosine and tangent are enough for most purposes. The tangent, truncated tangent and inverse tangent are shown in figure 4.9.3; the derivative of the arctangent is left as an exercise.\nExercises 4.9.\n1.

Of course, this integral is also the result of an approximation, in which we add up volumes of boxes that are \\(\\Delta r\\times\\Delta\\theta\\times\\hbox{height}\\); the problem is that the height that will give us the correct answer is not simply \\(r\\). Or put another way, we can think of the correct height as \\(r\\), but the area of the base \\(\\Delta r\\Delta\\theta\\) as being wrong. The height \\(r\\) comes from equation 15.7.1, which is to say, it is precisely the same as the corresponding height in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) version of the integral. The problem is that the area of the base \\(\\Delta x\\times\\Delta y\\) is not the same as the area of the base \\(\\Delta r\\times\\Delta\\theta\\).

The reasoning is this: we know that problem one can be solved easily by finding a function whose derivative is \\(3t\\). We also know that mathematically the two problems are the same, because both can be solved by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore, we don't really need to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer by computing a function with the derivative \\(3t\\) or, which is the same thing, \\(3x\\).\nIt's true that the first problem had the added complication of the \"10\", and we certainly need to be able to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple. The lesson then is this: whenever we can solve a problem by taking the limit of a sum of a certain form, we can instead of computing the (often nasty) limit find a new function with a certain derivative.\n#### Exercises 7.1\n1.

Given knowledge about an object's position, for example, we want to know the object's speed. Given information about the height of a curve we want to know its slope. We now consider problems that are, whether obviously or not, the reverse of such problems.\n##### Example 7.1.1\nAn object moves in a straight line so that its speed at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(v(t)=3t\\) in, say, cm/sec. If the object is at position 10 on the straight line when \\(t=0\\), where is the object at any time \\(t\\)?\nThere are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem.

If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult but also more general.\nWe start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at \\(t=0\\) the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, \\(t=1\\)? We know that the speed of the object at time \\(t=0\\) is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when \\(t=1\\). In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at \\(t=1\\), but certainly we can do better. Let's look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object\nat each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from \\(t=0.1\\) to \\(t=0.2\\), we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at \\(t=0.1\\). In this case the object would travel \\((0.3)(0.1)=0.03\\) centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between \\(t=0.2\\) and \\(t=0.3\\) the object would travel \\((0.6)(0.1)=0.06\\) centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object travels\n\n\n",

From \\(3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi=2\\pi\\), we get \\(\\arccos(2x-1)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). As we saw in Section 10.6, there are two possible ranges for the arcsecant function. Fortunately, both ranges contain \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). Applying Theorem 10.28 / 10.29, we get \\[\\arccos(2x-1) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] \\[\\sec(\\arccos(2x-1)) = \\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\] \\[2x-1 = 2\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Since }\\sec(\\arccos(u))=u\\] \\[x = \\frac{3}{2}\\] To check using our calculator, we need to graph \\(y=3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi\\). To do so, we make use of the identity \\(\\arccos(u)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{u}\\right)\\) from Theorems 10.28 and 10.29.16 We see the graph of \\(y=3\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2x-1}\\right)+\\pi\\) and the horizontal line \\(y=2\\pi\\) intersect at \\(\\frac{3}{2}=1.5\\).\n4. With the presence of both \\(\\arctan^{2}(x)\\) ( \\(=(\\arctan(x))^{2}\\)) and \\(\\arctan(x)\\), we substitute \\(u=\\arctan(x)\\). The equation \\(4\\arctan^{2}(x)-3\\pi\\arctan(x)-\\pi^{2}=0\\) becomes \\(4u^{2}-3\\pi u-\\pi^{2}=0\\). Factoring,17 we get \\((4u+\\pi)(u-\\pi)=0\\), so \\(u=\\arctan(x)=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) or \\(u=\\arctan(x)=\\pi\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arctangent, but \\(\\pi\\) is not, we only get solutions from the first equation. Using Theorem 10.27, we get Footnote 17: It’s not as bad as it looks... don’t let the \\(\\pi\\) throw you! \\[\\arctan(x) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = \\tan\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[x = -1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\tan(\\arctan(u))=u.\\] The calculator verifies our result.\n5. Since the inverse trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, we can solve inequalities featuring these functions using sign diagrams. Since all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\) are on one side of the inequality, we let \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) and note the domain of \\(f\\) is limited by the \\(\\arccos(x)\\) to \\([-1,1]\\). Next, we find the zeros of \\(f\\) by setting \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)=0\\). We get \\(\\arccos(x)=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), and since the range of arccosine is \\([0,\\pi]\\), we focus our attention on \\(\\arccos(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using Theorem 10.26, we get \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\) as our only zero. Hence, we have two test intervals, \\([-1,0)\\) and \\((0,1]\\). Choosing test values \\(x=\\pm 1\\), we get \\(f(-1)=-3\\pi^{2}<0\\) and \\(f(1)=\\pi^{2}>0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\), our answer is \\([-1,0)\\). The calculator confirms that for these values of \\(x\\), the graph of \\(y=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) is below \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis.)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n5. The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check, we note \\[\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of tangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= -3\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2})}\\] To determine which of our answers lie in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we first need to get an idea of the value of \\(2\\arctan(-3)\\). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\). Since this is outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we discard \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\) and all solutions of the form \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for \\(k>2\\). Graphically, we see \\(y=\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\) and \\(y=-3\\) intersect only once on \\([0,2\\pi)\\) at \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\approx 3.7851\\). Footnote 5: Your instructor will let you know if you should abandon the analytic route at this point and use your calculator. But seriously, what fun would that be?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. To find the domain and range of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\), we note that since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x\\) is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers. To determine the range of \\(f\\), we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7. Choosing our 'key' point to be \\((0,0)\\) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we find that the graph of \\(y=f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) differs from the graph of \\(y=F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) by a horizontal compression by a factor of \\(4\\) and a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\). It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of \\(\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We confirm our findings on the calculator below. 3. To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\n\n\n",

Clearly the point \\((-2,4.5)\\) does not have the largest \\(y\\) value of all of the points on the graph of \\(f\\,-\\) indeed that honor goes to \\((6,5.5)\\,-\\) but \\((-2,4.5)\\) should get some sort of consolation prize for being 'the top of the hill' between \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=3\\). We say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local maximum8** at the point \\((-2,4.5)\\), because the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(4.5\\) is the largest \\(y\\)-value (hence, function value) on the curve 'near'9\\(x=-2\\). Similarly, we say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local minimum**10 at the point \\((3,-8)\\), since the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(-8\\) is the smallest function value near \\(x=3\\). Although it is tempting to say that local extrema11 occur when the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it is not a precise enough way to define the concepts for the needs of Calculus. At the risk of being pedantic, we will present the traditional definitions and thoroughly vet the pathologies they induce in the Exercises. We have one last observation to make before we proceed to the algebraic definitions and look at a fairly tame, yet helpful, example.\nFootnote 10: Also called a ‘relative minimum’.\nIf we look at the entire graph, we see that the largest \\(y\\) value (the largest function value) is \\(5.5\\) at \\(x=6\\). In this case, we say the **maximum12** of \\(f\\) is \\(5.5\\); similarly, the **minimum13** of \\(f\\) is \\(-8\\).\nFootnote 12: ‘Maxima’ is the plural of ‘maximum’ and ‘mimima’ is the plural of ‘minimum’. ‘Extrema’ is the plural of ‘extremum’ which combines maximum and minimum.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nAnother easy case: If a function is continuous and has a single critical value, then if there is a local maximum at the critical value it is a global maximum, and if it is a local minimum it is a global minimum. There may also be a global minimum in the first case, or a global maximum in the second case, but that will generally require more effort to determine.\n**Example 6.1.3**  Let \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x-3\\). Find the maximum value of \\(f(x)\\) on the interval \\([0,4]\\). First note that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=-2x+4=0\\) when \\(x=2\\), and \\(f(2)=1\\). Next observe that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), so there are no other critical values. Finally, \\(f(0)=-3\\) and \\(f(4)=-3\\). The largest value of \\(f(x)\\) on the interval \\([0,4]\\) is \\(f(2)=1\\).\n**Example 6.1.4**  Let \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x-3\\). Find the maximum value of \\(f(x)\\) on the interval \\([-1,1]\\).\nFirst note that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=-2x+4=0\\) when \\(x=2\\). But \\(x=2\\) is not in the interval, so we don't use it. Thus the only two points to be checked are the endpoints; \\(f(-1)=-8\\) and \\(f(1)=0\\). So the largest value of \\(f(x)\\) on \\([-1,1]\\) is \\(f(1)=0\\).\n**Example 6.1.5**  Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\(f(x)=7+|x-2|\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(4\\) inclusive. The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is never zero, but \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=2\\), so we compute \\(f(2)=7\\). Checking the end points we get \\(f(1)=8\\) and \\(f(4)=9\\). The smallest of these numbers is \\(f(2)=7\\), which is, therefore, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) on the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 4\\), and the maximum is \\(f(4)=9\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcll}\\left(j\\circ j^{-1}\\right)(x)&=&j\\left(j^{-1}(x)\\right) \\\\ &=&j\\left(1-\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)\\\\ &=&\\left(1-\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)^{2}-2\\left(1-\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)+4\\\\ &=&1-2\\sqrt{x-3}+\\left(\\sqrt{x-3}\\right)^{2}-2+2\\sqrt{x-3}+4\\\\ &=&3+x-3\\\\ &=&x\\;\\diagup\\end{array}\\]\nUsing what we know from Section 1.7, we graph \\(y=j^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(y=j(x)\\) below.\n2. We graph \\(y=k(x)=\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\) using what we learned in Section 1.7 and see \\(k\\) is one-to-one.\nWe now try to find \\(k^{-1}\\).\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}y&=&k(x)\\\\ y&=&\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\\\ x&=&\\sqrt{y+2}-1\\\\ x+1&=&\\sqrt{y+2}\\\\ (x+1)^{2}&=&\\left(\\sqrt{y+2}\\right)^{2}\\\\ x^{2}+2x+1&=&y+2\\\\ y&=&x^{2}+2x-1\\end{array}\\]\nWe have \\(k^{-1}(x)=x^{2}+2x-1\\). Based on our experience, we know something isn't quite right. We determined \\(k^{-1}\\) is a quadratic function, and we have seen several times in this section that these are not one-to-one unless their domains are suitably restricted. Theorem 5.2 tells us that the domain of \\(k^{-1}\\) is the range of \\(k\\). From the graph of \\(k\\), we see that the range is \\([-1,\\infty)\\), which means we restrict the domain of \\(k^{-1}\\) to \\(x\\geq-1\\). We now check that this works in our compositions.\n\\[\\left(k^{-1}\\circ k\\right)\\left(x\\right) = k^{-1}(k(x))\\] \\[= k^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\right),\\ \\ x\\geq-2\\] \\[= \\left(\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\right)^{2}+2\\left(\\sqrt{x+2}-1\\right)-1\\] \\[= \\left(\\sqrt{x+2}\\right)^{2}-2\\sqrt{x+2}+1+2\\sqrt{x+2}-2-1\\] \\[= x+2-2\\] \\[= x\\ \\checkmark\\]\nand\n\\[\\left(k\\circ k^{-1}\\right)\\left(x\\right) = k\\left(x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\ \\ x\\geq-1\\] \\[= \\sqrt{(x^{2}+2x-1)+2}-1\\] \\[= \\sqrt{x^{2}+2x+1}-1\\] \\[= \\sqrt{(x+1)^{2}}-1\\] \\[= |x+1|-1\\] \\[= x+1-1\\] since\nGraphically, everything checks out as well, provided that we remember the domain restriction on \\(k^{-1}\\) means we take the right half of the parabola.\nOur last example of the section gives an application of inverse functions.\n\n\n",

As we see, we get entirely different results. Along these lines, note that \\(f(x+2)\\), \\(f(x)+2\\) and \\(f(x)+f(2)\\) are three _different_ expressions as well. Even though function notation uses parentheses, as does multiplication, there is _no_ general 'distributive property' of function notation. Finally, note the practice of using parentheses when substituting one algebraic expression into another; we highly recommend this practice as it will reduce careless errors.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### Exponential Equations and Inequalities\nIn this section we will develop techniques for solving equations involving exponential functions. Suppose, for instance, we wanted to solve the equation \\(2^{x}=128\\). After a moment's calculation, we find \\(128=2^{7}\\), so we have \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\). The one-to-one property of exponential functions, detailed in Theorem 6.4, tells us that \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\) if and only if \\(x=7\\). This means that not only is \\(x=7\\) a solution to \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\), it is the _only_ solution. Now suppose we change the problem ever so slightly to \\(2^{x}=129\\). We could use one of the inverse properties of exponentials and logarithms listed in Theorem 6.3 to write \\(129=2^{\\log_{2}(129)}\\). We'd then have \\(2^{x}=2^{\\log_{2}(129)}\\), which means our solution is \\(x=\\log_{2}(129)\\). This makes sense because, after all, the definition of \\(\\log_{2}(129)\\) is 'the exponent we put on \\(2\\) to get \\(129\\).' Indeed we could have obtained this solution directly by rewriting the equation \\(2^{x}=129\\) in its logarithmic form \\(\\log_{2}(129)=x\\). Either way, in order to get a reasonable decimal approximation to this number, we'd use the change of base formula, Theorem 6.7, to give us something more calculator friendly,1 say \\(\\log_{2}(129)=\\frac{\\ln(129)}{\\ln(2)}\\). Another way to arrive at this answer is as follows\nFootnote 1: You can use natural logs or common logs. We choose natural logs. (In Calculus, you’ll learn these are the most ‘mathy’ of the logarithms.)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nFootnote 2: Note the use of the indefinite article ‘a’. Whatever beast is chosen to be \\(i\\), \\(-i\\) is the other square root of \\(-1\\).\n\\[2=\\sqrt{4}=\\sqrt{-(-4)}=i\\sqrt{-4}=i(2i)=2i^{2}=2(-1)=-2,\\]\nwhich is unacceptable.3 We are now in the position to define the **complex numbers**.\nFootnote 3: We want to enlarge the number system so we can solve things like \\(x^{2}=-1\\), but not at the cost of the established rules already set in place. For that reason, the general properties of radicals simply do not apply for even roots of negative quantities.\n**Definition 3.5**.: A **complex number** is a number of the form \\(a+bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers and \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit.\nComplex numbers include things you'd normally expect, like \\(3+2i\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{5}-i\\sqrt{3}\\). However, don't forget that \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) could be zero, which means numbers like \\(3i\\) and \\(6\\) are also complex numbers. In other words, don't forget that the complex numbers _include_ the real numbers, so \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi-\\sqrt{21}\\) are both considered complex numbers.4 The arithmetic of complex numbers is as you would expect. The only things you need to remember are the two properties in Definition 3.4. The next example should help recall how these animals behave.\nFootnote 4: See the remarks in Section 1.1.1.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n29. \\((f\\circ h\\circ g)(x)=-2|\\sqrt{x}|=-2\\sqrt{x}\\), domain: \\([0,\\infty)\\)\n30. \\((f\\circ g\\circ h)(x)=-2\\sqrt{|x|}\\), , domain: \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\)\n31.

The hourly revenue at noon is $232 per hour.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\n\n",

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAt the very last step we have used theorems 2.3.9 and 2.3.10. \\(\\Box\\)\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\).

The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=L\\), then \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_{n}=L\\).\nAnd a final useful fact:\n\n\n",

Secondly, the function is broken up into two rules: one formula for values of \\(t\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\) inclusive, and another for values of \\(t\\) greater than \\(20\\). Since \\(t=10\\) satisfies the inequality \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), we use the first formula listed, \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), to find \\(h(10)\\). We get \\(h(10)=-5(10)^{2}+100(10)=500\\). Since \\(t\\) represents the number of seconds since lift-off and \\(h(t)\\) is the height above the ground in feet, the equation \\(h(10)=500\\) means that \\(10\\) seconds after lift-off, the model rocket is \\(500\\) feet above the ground. To find \\(h(60)\\), we note that \\(t=60\\) satisfies \\(t>20\\), so we use the rule \\(h(t)=0\\). This function returns a value of \\(0\\) regardless of what value is substituted in for \\(t\\), so \\(h(60)=0\\). This means that \\(60\\) seconds after lift-off, the rocket is \\(0\\) feet above the ground; in other words, a minute after lift-off, the rocket has already returned to Earth.\n2. Since the function \\(h\\) is defined in pieces, we need to solve \\(h(t)=375\\) in pieces. For \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), so for these values of \\(t\\), we solve \\(-5t^{2}+100t=375\\). Rearranging terms, we get \\(5t^{2}-100t+375=0\\), and factoring gives \\(5(t-5)(t-15)=0\\). Our answers are \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\), and since both of these values of \\(t\\) lie between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\), we keep both solutions. For \\(t>20\\), \\(h(t)=0\\), and in this case, there are no solutions to \\(0=375\\). In terms of the model rocket, solving \\(h(t)=375\\) corresponds to finding when, if ever, the rocket reaches \\(375\\) feet above the ground. Our two answers, \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\) correspond to the rocket reaching this altitude _twice_ - once \\(5\\) seconds after launch, and again \\(15\\) seconds after launch.12\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n1.

If in addition an external force is applied to the mass, and if the force varies according to a function of the form \\(a\\cos(\\omega t)+b\\sin(\\omega t)\\), then the long term behavior will be a simple oscillation determined by the steady state part of the general solution; the initial position of the mass will not matter. \\(\\Box\\)\nAs with the exponential form, such a simple guess may not work.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.7**: Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+16y=-\\sin(4t)\\).

Solving \\(\\overline{C}(x)<100\\) means we solve \\(\\frac{80x+150}{x}<100\\). We proceed as in the previous example. \\[\\frac{80x+150}{x} < 100\\] \\[\\frac{80x+150}{x}-100 < 0\\] \\[\\frac{80x+150-100x}{x} < 0\\qquad\\text{common denominator}\\] \\[\\frac{150-20x}{x} < 0\\] If we take the left hand side to be a rational function \\(r(x)\\), we need to keep in mind that the applied domain of the problem is \\(x>0\\). This means we consider only the positive half of the number line for our sign diagram. On \\((0,\\infty)\\), \\(r\\) is defined everywhere so we need only look for zeros of \\(r\\). Setting \\(r(x)=0\\) gives \\(150-20x=0\\), so that \\(x=\\frac{15}{2}=7.5\\). The test intervals on our domain are \\((0,7.5)\\) and \\((7.5,\\infty)\\). We find \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\((7.5,\\infty)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\text{\\textdagger}&(+)&0&(-)\\\\ \\hline\\\\ 0&7.5\\end{array}\\] In the context of the problem, \\(x\\) represents the number of PortaBoy games systems produced and \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\) is the average cost to produce each system. Solving \\(\\overline{C}(x)<100\\) means we are trying to find how many systems we need to produce so that the average cost is less than $100 per system. Our solution, \\((7.5,\\infty)\\) tells us that we need to produce more than 7.5 systems to achieve this. Since it doesn't make sense to produce half a system, our final answer is \\([8,\\infty)\\).\n3. When we apply Theorem 4.2 to \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\) we find that \\(y=80\\) is a horizontal asymptote to the graph of \\(y=\\overline{C}(x)\\). To more precisely determine the behavior of \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\) as \\(x\\to\\infty\\), we first use long division7 and rewrite \\(\\overline{C}(x)=80+\\frac{150}{x}\\). As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), \\(\\frac{150}{x}\\to 0^{+}\\), which means \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\approx 80+\\text{very small}\\)\\((+)\\). Thus the average cost per system is getting closer to $80 per system. If we set \\(\\overline{C}(x)=80\\), we get \\(\\frac{150}{x}=0\\), which is impossible, so we conclude that \\(\\overline{C}(x)>80\\) for all \\(x>0\\). This means that the average cost per system is always greater than $80 per system, but the average cost is approaching this amount as more and more systems are produced. Looking back at Example 2.1.5, we realize $80 is the variable cost per system\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n**1.**: Decide what the two variables are.\n**2.**: Find an equation relating them.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. For the system \\(\\left\\{x=\\sin(t),\\,y=\\csc(t)\\,\\right.\\) for \\(0<t<\\pi\\), we start by graphing \\(x=\\sin(t)\\) and \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) over the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\). We find that the range of \\(x\\) is \\((0,1]\\) while the range of \\(y\\) is \\([1,\\infty)\\). Plotting a few friendly points, we see that \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) gives the point \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\), \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) gives \\((1,1)\\) and \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) returns us to \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\). Since \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=\\pi\\) aren't included in the domain for \\(t\\), (because \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) is undefined at these \\(t\\)-values), we analyze the behavior of the system as \\(t\\) approaches \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\). We find that as \\(t\\to 0^{+}\\) as well as when \\(t\\to\\pi^{-}\\), we get \\(x=\\sin(t)\\to 0^{+}\\) and \\(y=\\csc(t)\\to\\infty\\). Piecing all of this information together, we get that for \\(t\\) near \\(0\\), we have points with very small positive \\(x\\)-values, but very large positive \\(y\\)-values. As \\(t\\) ranges through the interval \\(\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\), \\(x=\\sin(t)\\) is increasing and \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) is decreasing. This means that we are moving to the right and downwards, through \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) to \\((1,1)\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Once \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), the orientation reverses, and we start to head to the left, since \\(x=\\sin(t)\\) is now decreasing, and up, since \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) is now increasing. We pass back through \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\) when \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) back to the points with small positive \\(x\\)-coordinates and large\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nAs a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric equations. Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), and develops the formula for length:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx.\\]\nUsing some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use parametric equations \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx&=\\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;\\frac{dt}{dx}\\;dx\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2}}\\;dt\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v} \\sqrt{(f^{\\prime}(t))^{2}+(g^{\\prime}(t))^{2}}\\;dt.}\\]\nHere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the \\(t\\) limits corresponding to the \\(x\\) limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n**EXAMPLE 10.5.3** Find the length of one arch of the cycloid.

The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value.

Just as before:\n\\[\\int-\\frac{1}{2}(1-u)\\sqrt{u}\\,du=\\left(\\frac{1}{5}u-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)u^{3/2} +C.\\]\nThen since \\(u=1-x^{2}\\):\n\\[\\int x^{3}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\left(\\frac{1}{5}(1-x^{2})-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(1- x^{2})^{3/2}+C.\\]\nTo summarize: if we suspect that a given function is the derivative of another via the chain rule, we let \\(u\\) denote a likely candidate for the inner function, then translate the given function so that it is written entirely in terms of \\(u\\), with no \\(x\\) remaining in the expression. If we can integrate this new function of \\(u\\), then the antiderivative of the original function is obtained by replacing \\(u\\) by the equivalent expression in \\(x\\).\nEven in simple cases you may prefer to use this mechanical procedure, since it often helps to avoid silly mistakes. For example, consider again this simple problem:\n\\[\\int 2x\\cos(x^{2})\\,dx.\\]\nLet \\(u=x^{2}\\), then \\(du/dx=2x\\) or \\(du=2x\\,dx\\). Since we have exactly \\(2x\\,dx\\) in the original integral, we can replace it by \\(du\\):\n\\[\\int 2x\\cos(x^{2})\\,dx=\\int\\cos u\\,du=\\sin u+C=\\sin(x^{2})+C.\\]\nThis is not the only way to do the algebra, and typically there are many paths to the correct answer. Another possibility, for example, is: Since \\(du/dx=2x\\), \\(dx=du/2x\\), and\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\(\\bullet\\)\\(\\\nFrom this sketch, we know that the major axis is horizontal, meaning \\(a>b\\). With the vertices located at \\((\\pm 5,0)\\), we get \\(a=5\\) so \\(a^{2}=25\\). We also know that the center is \\((0,0)\\) because the center is the midpoint of the vertices. All that remains is to find \\(b^{2}\\). To that end, we use the fact that the eccentricity \\(e=\\frac{1}{4}\\) which means\n\\[e=\\frac{\\text{distance from the center to a focus}}{\\text{distance from the center to a vertex}}=\\frac{c}{a}=\\frac{c}{5}=\\frac{1}{4}\\]\nfrom which we get \\(c=\\frac{5}{4}\\). To get \\(b^{2}\\), we use the fact that \\(c=\\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\\), so \\(\\frac{5}{4}=\\sqrt{25-b^{2}}\\) from which we get \\(b^{2}=\\frac{375}{16}\\). Substituting all of our findings into the equation \\(\\frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\\), yields our final answer \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{25}+\\frac{16y^{2}}{375}=1\\).\nAs with parabolas, ellipses have a reflective property. If we imagine the dashed lines below representing sound waves, then the waves emanating from one focus reflect off the top of the ellipse and head towards the other focus.\nSuch geometry is exploited in the construction of so-called 'Whispering Galleries'. If a person whispers at one focus, a person standing at the other focus will hear the first person as if they were standing right next to them. We explore the Whispering Galleries in our last example.\n**Example 7.4.5**.: Jamie and Jason want to exchange secrets (terrible secrets) from across a crowded whispering gallery. Recall that a whispering gallery is a room which, in cross section, is half of an ellipse. If the room is 40 feet high at the center and 100 feet wide at the floor, how far from the outer wall should each of them stand so that they will be positioned at the foci of the ellipse?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 15.1.3**: Find the volume under the surface \\(z=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) and above the triangle formed by \\(y=x\\), \\(x=1\\), and the \\(x\\)-axis.\nLet's consider the two possible ways to set this up:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{x}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dy\\,dx\\qquad\\mbox{or}\\qquad\\int_{0}^{1 }\\int_{y}^{1}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx\\,dy.\\]\nWhich appears easier?

When the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) does not exist, it may be useful to note in what way it does not exist. We have already talked about one such case: one-sided limits. Another case is when \"\\(f\\) goes to infinity\". We also will occasionally want to know what happens to \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) \"goes to infinity\".\n**Example 4.10.1**: What happens to \\(1/x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(0\\)? From the right, \\(1/x\\) gets bigger and bigger, or goes to infinity. From the left it goes to negative infinity. \\(\\sqcap\\)__\n**Example 4.10.2**: What happens to the function \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity?

Roughly, we want \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) to mean that we can make \\(f(x)\\) arbitrarily large by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) should mean we can make \\(f(x)\\) as close as we want to \\(L\\) by making \\(x\\) large enough.

Let's pick \\(a=0\\) and \\(|x|\\leq\\pi/2\\); if we can compute \\(\\sin x\\) for \\(x\\in[-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]\\), we can of course compute \\(\\sin x\\) for all \\(x\\).\nWe need to pick \\(N\\) so that\n\\[\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|<0.005.\\]\nSince we have limited \\(x\\) to \\([-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]\\),\n\\[\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|<\\frac{2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}.\\]\nThe quantity on the right decreases with increasing \\(N\\), so all we need to do is find an \\(N\\) so that\n\\[\\frac{2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}<0.005.\\]\nA little trial and error shows that \\(N=8\\) works, and in fact \\(2^{9}/9!<0.0015\\), so\n\\[\\sin x =\\sum_{n=0}^{8}\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\,x^{n}\\pm 0.0015\\] \\[=x-\\frac{x^{3}}{6}+\\frac{x^{5}}{120}-\\frac{x^{7}}{5040}\\pm 0.0015.\\]\nFigure 11.11.1 shows the graphs of \\(\\sin x\\) and and the approximation on \\([0,3\\pi/2]\\).

As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\nWe can in fact turn this into a L'Hopital's Rule problem:\n\\[x\\ln x=\\frac{\\ln x}{1/x}=\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important). Using L'Hopital's Rule:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1/x}{-x^{-2}}= \\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1}{x}(-x^{2})=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}-x=0.\\]\nOne way to interpret this is that since \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}x\\ln x=0\\), the \\(x\\) approaches zero much faster than the \\(\\ln x\\) approaches \\(-\\infty\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe first two terms in parentheses are zero because \\(y_{1}\\) and \\(y_{2}\\) are solutions to the associated homogeneous equation. Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\nIf we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get\n\\[\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t\\] \\[\\dot{v} =e^{-3t}\\sin t\\] \\[v =-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-3t},\\]\n\n\n",

Recalling that \\(\\langle u,v,w\\rangle a=\\langle ua,va,wa\\rangle\\), we can then think of the gradient as\n\\[\\nabla f=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle f=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial f}{ \\partial x},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle,\\]\nthat is, we simply multiply the \\(f\\) into the vector.\nThe divergence and curl can now be defined in terms of this same odd vector \\(\\nabla\\) by using the cross product and dot product. The divergence of a vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle f,g,h\\rangle\\) is\n\\[\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial y},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\langle f,g,h\\rangle= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial h}{ \\partial z}.\\]\nThe curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\bf i}&{\\bf j}&{\\bf k}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial z}\\\\ f&g&h\\end{array}\\right|=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}-\\frac{ \\partial g}{\\partial z},\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}-\\frac{\\partial h}{ \\partial x},\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right\\rangle.\\]\nHere are two simple but useful facts about divergence and curl.\n**Theorem 16.5.1**: \\(\\nabla\\cdot(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})=0\\)_._\nIn words, this says that the divergence of the curl is zero.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nRoughly speaking, the first integral adds up the flow across the boundary of the region, from inside to out, and the second sums the divergence (tendency to spread) at each point in the interior. The theorem roughly says that the sum of the \"microscopic\" spreads is the same as the total spread across the boundary and out of the region.\n#### Exercises 16.5\n1.

When we approximate the integral in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, we are computing the volumes of tall thin\nFigure 15.7.2: Double change of variable.\nboxes, in this case boxes that are \\(\\Delta x\\times\\Delta y\\times\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\).

Of course, this integral is also the result of an approximation, in which we add up volumes of boxes that are \\(\\Delta r\\times\\Delta\\theta\\times\\hbox{height}\\); the problem is that the height that will give us the correct answer is not simply \\(r\\). Or put another way, we can think of the correct height as \\(r\\), but the area of the base \\(\\Delta r\\Delta\\theta\\) as being wrong. The height \\(r\\) comes from equation 15.7.1, which is to say, it is precisely the same as the corresponding height in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) version of the integral. The problem is that the area of the base \\(\\Delta x\\times\\Delta y\\) is not the same as the area of the base \\(\\Delta r\\times\\Delta\\theta\\). We can think of the \"?\" in the integral as a correction factor that is needed so that \\(?\\,dr\\,d\\theta=dx\\,dy\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\({\\bf r}_{y}\\times{\\bf r}_{z}=\\langle 1,-g_{2y},-g_{2z}\\rangle\\); the dot product of this with \\({\\bf i}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle\\) is 1.
