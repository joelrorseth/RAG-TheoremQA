For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\n\n",

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\n\n\n",

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\n\n\n",

The graph contains seven vertices -- three vertices for the three pizza parlors, and four vertices for the four student houses. If a house ordered pizza from a particular parlor in the last month, then this support is modeled by an edge in the graph. (Later, we might also choose to weight the edge by the number of pizzas ordered from that parlor over the last month.)\nThis graph has a particular structure: there are no edges between two pizza parlors, since a pizza parlor never orders pizza from another parlor; similarly, there are no edges between two houses, since no house ever orders pizza from another house!\nMany problems in graph theory involve matching two different types of objects, like students with jobs, or pets with owners.\n\n\n",

In how many ways can he\nmake such a distribution? At first, this looks a lot like the problem of enumerating integers solutions of equations, except here the lottery tickets are not identical! A ticket bearing the numbers 1, 3, 10, 23, 47, and 50 will almost surely not pay out the same amount as one with the numbers 2, 7, 10, 30, 31, and 48, so who gets which ticket really makes a difference. Hopefully, you have already recognized that the fact that we're dealing with lottery tickets and grandchildren isn't so important here. Rather, the important fact is that we want to distribute distinguishable objects to distinct entities, which calls for counting functions from one set (lottery tickets) to another (grandchildren). In our example, we don't simply want the total number of functions, but instead we want the number of surjections, so that we can ensure that every grandchild gets a ticket.\nFor positive integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), let \\(S(n,m)\\) denote the number of surjections from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Note that \\(S(n,m)=0\\) when \\(n<m\\). In this section, we apply the Inclusion-Exclusion formula to determine a formula for \\(S(n,m)\\). We start by setting \\(X\\) to be the set of all functions from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Then for each \\(f\\in X\\) and each \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,m\\), we say that \\(f\\) satisfies property \\(P_{i}\\) if \\(i\\) is not in the range of \\(f\\).\n\n\n",

Here we repeat the proof from Method 1, using the vocabulary of sets. By Theorem 3.3.9, the number of _ordered_ subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). However, that counts each unordered subset \\(k!\\) times, since \\(k!\\) is the number of permutations of \\(k\\) objects (Theorem 3.3.4).

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nA group of 7 people is to be divided into 3 committees. Within each committee, people are ranked in a certain order. In how many ways can this be done?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n\n\n",

Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\).

We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n\n\n",

In how many ways can we choose 4 balls, if at least 2 are red?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 2.7 Multinomial Coefficients\nLet \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n\n\n",
