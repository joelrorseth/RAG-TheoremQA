By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n2. This is a set partition since the blocks of students are not assigned to different days of the week. There are \\(4!\\) ways to order the \\(4\\) blocks. So we divide the answer to part (1) by \\(4!\\).\nAs a final application, we see what happens if we take a power of a sum of more than two variables. The answer to this question is why the expression \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{n}}\\) is often called a _multinomial coefficient_.\n\n\n",

And we learned how to solve this kind of question in Chapter 2. The answer of course is \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\).\nThe strategy for Assigner is so simple and natural, it might be the case that a more complex strategy would yield a more efficient partitioning.

You have 9 dollars to spend. Each day at lunch you buy exactly one item: either an apple for $1, or a yogurt for $2, or a sandwich for $4. You continue buying one item each day until you have exactly $0. This could take anywhere from 9 days, if you buy 9 apples in a row, to 3 days, if you buy 2 sandwiches in a row then an apple. Buying two sandwiches then an apple is different from buying an apple then two sandwiches. In how many different ways can you spend your money?\n\n\n",

There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n\n\n",

Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones.

More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick).

The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n\n\n",

Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color.
