When the system of linear equations is over-determined, there are more equations than variables or unknowns. When the system of linear equations is under-determined, there are more unknowns than equations. When the system of linear equations is square, the numbers of unknowns and equations is the same. A set of equations with zero right-hand side, \\(Ax=0\\), is called a _homogeneous_ set of equations. Any homogeneous set of equations has \\(x=0\\) as a solution.\nIn chapter 11 we will address the question of how to determine if a system of linear equations has a solution, and how to find one when it does. For now, we give a few interesting examples.\n#### Examples\nCoefficients of linear combinations.Let \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) denote the columns of \\(A\\). The system of linear equations \\(Ax=b\\) can be expressed as\n\\[x_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+x_{n}a_{n}=b,\\]\n_i.e._, \\(b\\) is a linear combination of \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) with coefficients \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\). So solving \\(Ax=b\\) is the same as finding coefficients that express \\(b\\) as a linear combination of the vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\).\nPolynomial interpolation.We seek a polynomial \\(p\\) of degree at most \\(n-1\\) that interpolates a set of \\(m\\) given points \\((t_{i},y_{i})\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,m\\). (This means that \\(p(t_{i})=y_{i}\\).) We can express this as a set of \\(m\\) linear equations in the \\(n\\) unknowns \\(c\\), where \\(c\\) is the \\(n\\)-vector of coefficients: \\(Ac=y\\). Here the matrix \\(A\\) is the Vandermonde matrix (6.7), and the vector \\(c\\) is the vector of polynomial coefficients, as described in the example on page 120.\n\n\n",

This gives a nice interpretation of linear independence: A list of vectors is linearly independent if and only if for any linear combination of them, we can infer or deduce the associated coefficients. (We will see later how to do this.)\nSupersets and subsets.If a collection of vectors is linearly dependent, then any superset of it is linearly dependent. In other words: If we add vectors to a linearly dependent collection of vectors, the new collection is also linearly dependent. Any nonempty subset of a linearly independent collection of vectors is linearly independent. In other words: Removing vectors from a collection of vectors preserves linear independence.\n\n\n",

This means that for each atom appearing in any of the reactants or products, the total amount on the left-hand side must equal the total amount on the right-hand side. (If any of the reactants or products is charged, _i.e._, an ion, then the total charge must also balance.) In the simple water electrolysis reaction above, for example, we have 4 hydrogen atoms on the left (2 water molecules, each with 2 hydrogen atoms), and 4 on the right (2 hydrogen molecules, each with 2 hydrogen atoms). The oxygen atoms also balance, so this reaction is balanced.\nBalancing a chemical reaction with specified reactants and products, _i.e._, finding the numbers \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{p}\\) and \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{q}\\), can be expressed as a system of linear equations. We can express the requirement that the reaction balances as a set of\n\\(m\\) equations, where \\(m\\) is the number of different atoms appearing in the chemical reaction. We define the \\(m\\times p\\) matrix \\(R\\) by\n\\[R_{ij}=\\mbox{number of atoms of type $i$ in $R_{j}$},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,m,\\quad j=1, \\ldots,p.\\]\n(The entries of \\(R\\) are nonnegative integers.) The matrix \\(R\\) is interesting; for example, its \\(j\\)th column gives the chemical formula for reactant \\(R_{j}\\). We let \\(a\\) denote the \\(p\\)-vector with entries \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{p}\\). Then, the \\(m\\)-vector \\(Ra\\) gives the total number of atoms of each type appearing in the reactants. We define an \\(m\\times q\\) matrix \\(P\\) in a similar way, so the \\(m\\)-vector \\(Pb\\) gives the total number of atoms of each type that appears in the products.\nWe write the balance condition using vectors and matrices as \\(Ra=Pb\\).

(Here we use the property that the square of the matrix norm is the sum of the squared norms of the columns of the matrix.) So the objective is a sum of \\(k\\) terms, with each term depending on only one column of \\(X\\). It follows that we can choose the columns \\(x_{j}\\) independently, each one by minimizing its associated term \\(\\|Ax_{j}-b_{j}\\|^{2}\\). Assuming that \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns, the solution is \\(\\hat{x}_{j}=A^{\\dagger}b_{j}\\). The solution of the matrix least squares problem is therefore\n\\[\\hat{X} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\hat{x}_{1}&\\cdots&\\hat{x}_{k}\\end{array}\\right]\\] (12.12) \\[= \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}A^{\\dagger}b_{1}&\\cdots&A^{\\dagger}b_{ k}\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[= A^{\\dagger}\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}b_{1}&\\cdots&b_{k}\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[= A^{\\dagger}B.\\]\nThe very simple solution \\(\\hat{X}=A^{\\dagger}B\\) of the matrix least squares problem agrees with the solution of the ordinary least squares problem when \\(k=1\\) (as it must). Many software packages for linear algebra use the backslash operator \\(A\\backslash B\\) to denote \\(A^{\\dagger}B\\), but this is not standard mathematical notation.\nThe matrix least squares problem can be solved efficiently by exploiting the fact that algorithm 12.1 is another example of a factor-solve algorithm. To compute \\(\\hat{X}=A^{\\dagger}B\\) we carry out the QR factorization of \\(A\\) once; we carry out steps 2 and 3 of algorithm 12.1 for each of the \\(k\\) columns of \\(B\\). The total cost is \\(2mn^{2}+k(2mn+n^{2})\\) flops. When \\(k\\) is small compared to \\(n\\) this is roughly \\(2mn^{2}\\) flops, the same cost as solving a single least squares problem (_i.e._, one with a vector right-hand side).\n\n\n",

A matrix of size \\(m\\times n\\) is called an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix.\nThe _elements_ (or _entries_ or _coefficients_) of a matrix are the values in the array. The \\(i,j\\) element is the value in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column, denoted by double subscripts: the \\(i,j\\) element of a matrix \\(A\\) is denoted \\(A_{ij}\\) (or \\(A_{i,j}\\), when \\(i\\) or \\(j\\) is more than one digit or character). The positive integers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are called the (row and column) _indices_.

The second step requires the solution of a square system of \\(n+p\\) equations, which costs \\(2(n+p)^{3}\\) flops, so the total is\n\\[mn^{2}+2(n+p)^{3}\\]\nflops.

The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients. The coefficients of \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are \\(a*b\\) and the coefficients of \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are \\(b*a\\). These must be the same.\n\n\n",

These properties follow from the polynomial coefficient property above, and can also be directly shown. As an example, let us show that \\(a*b=b*a\\). Suppose \\(p\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(a\\), and \\(q\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(b\\). The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients. The coefficients of \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are \\(a*b\\) and the coefficients of \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are \\(b*a\\). These must be the same.\nA basic property is that for fixed \\(a\\), the convolution \\(a*b\\) is a linear function of \\(b\\); and for fixed \\(b\\), it is a linear function of \\(a\\). This means we can express \\(a*b\\) as a matrix-vector product:\n\n\n",

Any \\(n\\)-vector \\(b\\) can be written as the linear combination \\[b=b_{1}e_{1}+\\cdots+b_{n}e_{n}.\\] (This was already observed on page 17.) This expansion is unique, which means that there is no other linear combination of \\(e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}\\) that equals \\(b\\).\n* The vectors \\[a_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.2\\\\ -2.6\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-0.3\\\\ -3.7\\end{array}\\right]\\] are a basis. The vector \\(b=(1,1)\\) can be expressed in only one way as a linear combination of them: \\[b=0.6513\\,a_{1}-0.7280\\,a_{2}.\\] (The coefficients are given here to 4 significant digits. We will see later how these coefficients can be computed.)\n**Cash flows and single period loans.** As a practical example, we consider cash flows over \\(n\\) periods, with positive entries meaning income or cash in and negative entries meaning payments or cash out. We define the single-period loan cash flow vectors as\n\\[l_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0_{i-1}\\\\ 1\\\\ -(1+r)\\\\ 0_{n-i-1}\\end{array}\\right],\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n-1,\\]\nwhere \\(r\\geq 0\\) is the per-period interest rate. The cash flow \\(l_{i}\\) represents a loan of $1 in period \\(i\\), which is paid back in period \\(i+1\\) with interest \\(r\\). (The subscripts on the zero vectors above give their dimensions.) Scaling \\(l_{i}\\) changes the loan amount; scaling \\(l_{i}\\) by a negative coefficient converts it into a loan _to_ another entity (which is paid back in period \\(i+1\\) with interest).\n\n\n",

Then \\(C=AB\\) can be expressed as the \\(m\\times n\\) block matrix with entries \\(C_{ij}\\), given by the formula (10.1). For example, we have\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}A&B\\\\ C&D\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}E&F\\\\ G&H\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}AE+BG&AF+BH\\\\ CE+DG&CF+DH\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nfor any matrices \\(A,B,\\ldots,H\\) for which the matrix products above make sense. This formula is the same as the formula for multiplying two \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices (_i.e._, with scalar entries); but when the entries of the matrix are themselves matrices (as in the block matrix above), we must be careful to preserve the multiplication order.\nColumn interpretation of matrix-matrix product.We can derive some additional insight into matrix multiplication by interpreting the operation in terms of the columns of the second matrix. Consider the matrix product of an \\(m\\times p\\) matrix \\(A\\) and a \\(p\\times n\\) matrix \\(B\\), and denote the columns of \\(B\\) by \\(b_{k}\\). Using block-matrix notation, we can write the product \\(AB\\) as\n\\[AB=A\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}b_{1}&b_{2}&\\cdots&b_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\,= \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}Ab_{1}&Ab_{2}&\\cdots&Ab_{n}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThus, the columns of \\(AB\\) are the matrix-vector products of \\(A\\) and the columns of \\(B\\). The product \\(AB\\) can be interpreted as the matrix obtained by 'applying' \\(A\\) to each of the columns of \\(B\\).\nMultiple sets of linear equations.We can use the column interpretation of matrix multiplication to express a set of \\(k\\) linear equations with the same \\(m\\times n\\) coefficient matrix \\(A\\),\n\\[Ax_{i}=b_{i},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,k,\\]\nin the compact form\n\\[AX=B,\\]\n\n\n",
