Question: How many triangles are there whose sides are all integers and whose maximum side length equals 11?\nConsider the reasoning steps: \n 2. Another possible next step is to use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. By applying this theorem to all possible combinations of integer side lengths up to 11, we can quickly eliminate any combinations that do not form valid triangles.\n3. One possible next step is to list out all the possible combinations of integer side lengths up to 11 and then check each combination to see if it forms a valid triangle according to the triangle inequality theorem.\n\nWrite the continuation steps line by line.
