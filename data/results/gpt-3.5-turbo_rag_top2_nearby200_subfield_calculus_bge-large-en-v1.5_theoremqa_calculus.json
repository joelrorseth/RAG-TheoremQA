It's about time for an example.\n**Example 10.6.1**.:\n1. Find the exact values of the following. 1. \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) 2. \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) 3. \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) 4. \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) 5. \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\\) 6. \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\\) 7. \\(\\cos\\left(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)\\) 8. \\(\\sin\\left(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)\\)\n2. Rewrite the following as algebraic expressions of \\(x\\) and state the domain on which the equivalence is valid. 1. \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\) 2. \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. 1. To find \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), we need to find the real number \\(t\\) (or, equivalently, an angle measuring \\(t\\) radians) which lies between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). We know \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) meets these criteria, so \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The value of \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) is a real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). The number we seek is \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Hence, \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). 3. The number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) lies in the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Our answer is \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\). 4. To find \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), we seek the number \\(t\\) in the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). The answer is \\(t=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) so that \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). 5. Since \\(0\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\leq\\pi\\), we could simply invoke Theorem 10.26 to get \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). However, in order to make sure we understand _why_ this is the case, we choose to work the example through using the definition of arccosine. Working from the inside out, \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3 }}{2}\\right)\\). Now, \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\) is the real number \\(t\\) with \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), so that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n27. Analytically show that the function \\(f(x)=x^{3}+3x+1\\) is one-to-one. Since finding a formula for its inverse is beyond the scope of this textbook, use Theorem 5.2 to help you compute \\(f^{-1}(1),\\ f^{-1}(5),\\ \\text{and}\\ f^{-1}(-3)\\).\n28. Let \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^{2}-1}\\). Using the techniques in Section 4.2, graph \\(y=f(x)\\). Verify that \\(f\\) is one-to-one on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Use the procedure outlined on Page 384 and your graphing calculator to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\). Note that since \\(f(0)=0\\), it should be the case that \\(f^{-1}(0)=0\\). What goes wrong when you attempt to substitute \\(x=0\\) into \\(f^{-1}(x)\\)? Discuss with your classmates how this problem arose and possible remedies.\n29. With the help of your classmates, explain why a function which is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on its entire domain would have to be one-to-one, hence invertible.\n30.

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\n\n",

It requires more computation and more theorems than the alternative.4 In general, no matter how many theorems you throw at a polynomial, it may well be impossible5 to find their zeros exactly. The polynomial \\(f(x)=x^{5}-x-1\\) is one such beast.6 According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, \\(f\\) has exactly one positive real zero, and it could have two negative real zeros, or none at all. The Rational Zeros\nTest gives us \\(\\pm 1\\) as rational zeros to try but neither of these work since \\(f(1)=f(-1)=-1\\). If we try the substitution technique we used in Example 3.3.4, we find \\(f(x)\\) has three terms, but the exponent on the \\(x^{5}\\) isn't exactly twice the exponent on \\(x\\). How could we go about approximating the positive zero without resorting to the 'Zero' command of a graphing calculator? We use the **Bisection Method**. The first step in the Bisection Method is to find an interval on which \\(f\\) changes sign. We know \\(f(1)=-1\\) and we find \\(f(2)=29\\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, we know that the zero of \\(f\\) lies in the interval \\([1,2]\\). Next, we 'bisect' this interval and find the midpoint is \\(1.5\\). We have that \\(f(1.5)\\approx 5.09\\). This means that our zero is between \\(1\\) and \\(1.5\\), since \\(f\\) changes sign on this interval. Now, we 'bisect' the interval \\([1,1.5]\\) and find \\(f(1.25)\\approx 0.80\\), so now we have the zero between \\(1\\) and \\(1.25\\). Bisecting \\([1,1.25]\\), we find \\(f(1.125)\\approx-0.32\\), which means the zero of \\(f\\) is between \\(1.125\\) and \\(1.25\\). We continue in this fashion until we have 'sandwiched' the zero between two numbers which differ by no more than a desired accuracy. You can think of the Bisection Method as reversing the sign diagram process: instead of finding the zeros and checking the sign of \\(f\\) using test values, we are using test values to determine where the signs switch to find the zeros. It is a slow and tedious, yet fool-proof, method for approximating a real zero.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 3.4 Complex Zeros and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nIn Section 3.3, we were focused on finding the real zeros of a polynomial function. In this section, we expand our horizons and look for the non-real zeros as well. Consider the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^{2}+1\\). The zeros of \\(p\\) are the solutions to \\(x^{2}+1=0\\), or \\(x^{2}=-1\\). This equation has no real solutions, but you may recall from Intermediate Algebra that we can formally extract the square roots of both sides to get \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{-1}\\). The quantity \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is usually re-labeled \\(i\\), the so-called **imaginary unit**.1 The number \\(i\\), while not a real number, plays along well with real numbers, and acts very much like any other radical expression. For instance, \\(3(2i)=6i\\), \\(7i-3i=4i\\), \\((2-7i)+(3+4i)=5-3i\\), and so forth. The key properties which distinguish \\(i\\) from the real numbers are listed below.\nFootnote 1: Some Technical Mathematics textbooks label it ‘\\(j\\)’.\n**Definition 3.4**.: The imaginary unit \\(i\\) satisfies the two following properties\n1. \\(i^{2}=-1\\)\n2. If \\(c\\) is a real number with \\(c\\geq 0\\) then \\(\\sqrt{-c}=i\\sqrt{c}\\)\nProperty 1 in Definition 3.4 establishes that \\(i\\) does act as a square root2 of \\(-1\\), and property 2 establishes what we mean by the 'principal square root' of a negative real number. In property 2, it is important to remember the restriction on \\(c\\). For example, it is perfectly acceptable to say \\(\\sqrt{-4}=i\\sqrt{4}=i(2)=2i\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{-(-4)}\\neq i\\sqrt{-4}\\), otherwise, we'd get\n\n\n",

The last equation we are asked to solve, \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), poses two immediate problems. First, we are not told whether or not \\(x\\) represents an angle or a real number. We assume the latter, but note that we will use angles and the Unit Circle to solve the equation regardless. Second, as we have mentioned, there is no universally accepted range of the arcsecant function. For that reason, we adopt the advice given in Section 10.3 and convert this to the cosine problem \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Adopting an angle approach, we consider the equation \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and note that our solutions lie in Quadrants II and III. Since \\(-\\frac{3}{5}\\) isn't the cosine of any of the 'common angles', we'll need to express our solutions in terms of the arccosine function. The real number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) is defined so that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). If we let \\(\\beta=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) radians, we see that \\(\\beta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. To obtain a Quadrant III angle solution, we may simply use \\(-\\beta=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\). Since all angle solutions are coterminal with \\(\\beta\\) or \\(-\\beta\\), we get our solutions to \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) to be \\(\\theta=\\beta+2\\pi k=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=-\\beta+2\\pi k=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Switching back to the variable \\(x\\), we record our final answer to \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\) as \\(x=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=4\\) \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) \\(\\cot\\left(3x\\right)=0.87\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. The solutions to \\(\\cos(u)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) are \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\n\n",

It is possible to simplify this. Using the identity \\(\\sin 2x=2\\sin x\\cos x\\), we can write \\(\\sin 2u=2\\sin u\\cos u=2\\sin(\\arcsin x)\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}u}=2x\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2} (\\arcsin x)}=2x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}.\\) Then the full antiderivative is\n\\[\\frac{\\arcsin x}{2}+\\frac{2x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{4}=\\frac{\\arcsin x}{2}+\\frac{x \\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{2}+C.\\]\nThis type of substitution is usually indicated when the function you wish to integrate contains a polynomial expression that might allow you to use the fundamental identity \\(\\sin^{2}x+\\cos^{2}x=1\\) in one of three forms:\n\\[\\cos^{2}x=1-\\sin^{2}x\\qquad\\sec^{2}x=1+\\tan^{2}x\\qquad\\tan^{2}x=\\sec^{2}x-1.\\]\nIf your function contains \\(1-x^{2}\\), as in the example above, try \\(x=\\sin u\\); if it contains \\(1+x^{2}\\) try \\(x=\\tan u\\); and if it contains \\(x^{2}-1\\), try \\(x=\\sec u\\). Sometimes you will need to try something a bit different to handle constants other than one.\n**Example 8.3.2** Evaluate \\(\\int\\sqrt{4-9x^{2}}\\,dx\\). We start by rewriting this so that it looks more like the previous example:\n\\[\\int\\sqrt{4-9x^{2}}\\,dx=\\int\\sqrt{4(1-(3x/2)^{2})}\\,dx=\\int 2\\sqrt{1-(3x/2)^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nNow let \\(3x/2=\\sin u\\) so \\((3/2)\\,dx=\\cos u\\,du\\) or \\(dx=(2/3)\\cos u\\,du\\).

Then\n\nDocument 2:\n----\ngives \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\). Since natural \\(\\log\\) is \\(\\log\\) base \\(e\\), \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=-2t\\). We can also use the Power Rule to write \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=-\\ln(9)\\). Putting these two steps together, we simplify \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\) to \\(-2t=-\\ln(9)\\). We arrive at our solution, \\(t=\\frac{\\ln(9)}{2}\\) which simplifies to \\(t=\\ln(3)\\). (Can you explain why?) The calculator confirms the graphs of \\(f(x)=75\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2x}}\\) intersect at \\(x=\\ln(3)\\approx 1.099\\). 5. We start solving \\(25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\) by rewriting \\(25=5^{2}\\) so that we have \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{x}=5^{x}+6\\), or \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\). Even though we have a common base, having two terms on the right hand side of the equation foils our plan of equating exponents or taking logs. If we stare at this long enough, we notice that we have three terms with the exponent on one term exactly twice that of another. To our surprise and delight, we have a 'quadratic in disguise'. Letting \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(u^{2}=\\left(5^{x}\\right)^{2}=5^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\) becomes \\(u^{2}=u+6\\). Solving this as \\(u^{2}-u-6=0\\) gives \\(u=-2\\) or \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(5^{x}=-2\\) or \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since \\(5^{x}=-2\\) has no real solution, (Why not?) we focus on \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since it isn't convenient to express \\(3\\) as a power of \\(5\\), we take natural logs and get \\(\\ln\\left(5^{x}\\right)=\\ln(3)\\) so that \\(x\\ln(5)=\\ln(3)\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\). On the calculator, we see the graphs of \\(f(x)=25^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=5^{x}+6\\) intersect at \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\approx 0.6826\\). 6. At first, it's unclear how to proceed with \\(\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\), besides clearing the denominator to obtain \\(e^{x}-e^{-x}=10\\). Of course, if we rewrite \\(e^{-x}=\\frac{1}{e^{x}}\\), we see we have another denominator lurking in the problem: \\(e^{x}-\\frac{1}{e^{x}}=10\\). Clearing this denominator gives us \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\), and once again, we have an equation with three terms where the exponent on one term is exactly twice that of another - a 'quadratic in disguise.' If we let \\(u=e^{x}\\), then \\(u^{2}=e^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\) can be viewed as \\(u^{2}-1=10u\\). Solving \\(u^{2}-10u-1=0\\), we obtain by the quadratic formula \\(u=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). From this, we have \\(e^{x}=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). Since \\(5-\\sqrt{26}<0\\), we get no real solution to \\(e^{x}=5-\\sqrt{26}\\), but for \\(e^{x}=5+\\sqrt{26}\\), we take natural logs to obtain \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\). If we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}\\) and \\(g(x)=5\\), we see that the graphs intersect at \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\approx 2.312\\)\n\n\n",

The Horizontal Line Test:** A function \\(f\\) is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects the graph of \\(f\\) more than once.\nWe say that the graph of a function **passes** the Horizontal Line Test if no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once; otherwise, we say the graph of the function **fails** the Horizontal Line Test. We have argued that if \\(f\\) is invertible, then \\(f\\) must be one-to-one, otherwise the graph given by reflecting the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) about the line \\(y=x\\) will fail the Vertical Line Test. It turns out that being one-to-one is also enough to guarantee invertibility. To see this, we think of \\(f\\) as the set of ordered pairs which constitute its graph. If switching the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points results in a function, then \\(f\\) is invertible and we have found \\(f^{-1}\\). This is precisely what the Horizontal Line Test does for us: it checks to see whether or not a set of points describes \\(x\\) as a function of \\(y\\). We summarize these results below.\n**Theorem 5.5**.: **Equivalent Conditions for Invertibility:** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function. The following statements are equivalent.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\((x,f(x))\\) & \\(f(x)\\) & \\(g(x)=f(x)+2\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(0\\) & \\((0,1)\\) & \\(1\\) & \\(3\\) & \\((0,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(2\\) & \\((2,3)\\) & \\(3\\) & \\(5\\) & \\((2,5)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(4\\) & \\((4,3)\\) & \\(3\\) & \\(5\\) & \\((4,5)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(5\\) & \\((5,5)\\) & \\(5\\) & \\(7\\) & \\((5,7)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} In general, if \\((a,b)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\), then \\(f(a)=b\\), so \\(g(a)=f(a)+2=b+2\\). Hence, \\((a,b+2)\\) is on the graph of \\(g\\). In other words, to obtain the graph of \\(g\\), we add \\(2\\) to the \\(y\\)-coordinate of each point on the graph of \\(f\\). Geometrically, adding \\(2\\) to the \\(y\\)-coordinate of a point moves the point \\(2\\) units above its previous location. Adding \\(2\\) to every \\(y\\)-coordinate on a graph _en masse_ is usually described as 'shifting the graph up \\(2\\) units'. Notice that the graph retains the same basic shape as before, it is just \\(2\\) units above its original location. In other words, we connect the four points we moved in the same manner in which they were connected before. We have the results side-by-side at the top of the next page.\nYou'll note that the domain of \\(f\\) and the domain of \\(g\\) are the same, namely \\([0,5]\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\([1,5]\\) while the range of \\(g\\) is \\([3,7]\\). In general, shifting a function vertically like this will leave the domain unchanged, but could very well affect the range. You can easily imagine what would happen if we wanted to graph the function \\(j(x)=f(x)-2\\). Instead of adding \\(2\\) to each of the \\(y\\)-coordinates on the graph of \\(f\\), we'd be subtracting \\(2\\). Geometrically, we would be moving the graph down \\(2\\) units. We leave it to the reader to verify that the domain of \\(j\\) is the same as \\(f\\), but the range of \\(j\\) is \\([-1,3]\\).

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nJulian is jogging around a circular track of radius 50 m. In a coordinate system with its origin at the center of the track, Julian's x-coordinate is changing at a rate of -1.25 m/s when his coordinates are (40, 30). Find dy/dt at this moment.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf \\(y\\) is written in terms of \\(x\\), i.e., \\(y=f(x)\\), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOur goal is to find parametric equations for the coordinates of the point \\(P(x,y)\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\). From our work in Example 11.10.4 number 3, we know that clockwise motion along the Unit Circle starting at the point \\((0,-1)\\) can be modeled by the equations \\(\\{x=-\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-\\cos(\\theta)\\) for \\(0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi\\). (We have renamed the parameter '\\(\\theta\\)' to match the context of this problem.) To model this motion on a circle of radius \\(r\\), all we need to do11 is multiply both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by the factor \\(r\\) which yields \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\). We now need to adjust for the fact that the circle isn't stationary with center \\((0,0)\\), but rather, is rolling along the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Since the velocity \\(v\\) is constant, we know that at time \\(t\\), the center of the circle has traveled a distance \\(vt\\) down the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Furthermore, since the radius of the circle is \\(r\\) and the circle isn't moving vertically, we know that the center of the circle is always \\(r\\) units above the \\(x\\)-axis. Putting these two facts together, we have that at time \\(t\\), the center of the circle is at the point \\((vt,r)\\). From Section 10.1.1, we know \\(v=\\frac{r\\theta}{t}\\), or \\(vt=r\\theta\\). Hence, the center of the circle, in terms of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), is \\((r\\theta,r)\\). As a result, we need to modify the equations \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\) by shifting the \\(x\\)-coordinate to the right \\(r\\theta\\) units (by adding \\(r\\theta\\) to the expression for \\(x\\)) and the \\(y\\)-coordinate up \\(r\\) units12 (by adding \\(r\\) to the expression for \\(y\\)). We get \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta)+r\\theta,\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)+r\\,,\\) which can be written as \\(\\{x=r(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta)),\\,y=r(1-\\cos(\\theta))\\,\\). Since the motion starts at \\(\\theta=0\\) and proceeds indefinitely, we set \\(\\theta\\geq 0\\).\n\n\n",

First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense.

We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense).

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\n\n",

If we want to say that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\), we need to capture the idea that as \\((x,y)\\) gets close to \\((a,b)\\) then \\(f(x,y)\\) gets close to \\(L\\). For functions of one variable, \\(f(x)\\), there are only two ways that \\(x\\) can approach \\(a\\): from the left or right. But there are an infinite number of ways to approach \\((a,b)\\): along any one of an infinite number of lines, or an infinite number of parabolas, or an infinite number of sine curves, and so on. We might hope that it's really not so bad--suppose, for example, that along every possible line through \\((a,b)\\) the value of \\(f(x,y)\\) gets close to \\(L\\); surely this means that \"\\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(L\\) as \\((x,y)\\) approaches \\((a,b)\\)\". Sadly, no.\n**EXAMPLE 14.2.1** Consider \\(f(x,y)=xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\). When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well.

Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\).

When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\n\n",

It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\). On the calculator, we graph \\(f(x)=2000\\) and \\(g(x)=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1x}\\) and find that they intersect at \\(x=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\approx-6.3093\\).\n3. We first note that we can rewrite the equation \\(9\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) as \\(3^{2}\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) to obtain \\(3^{x+2}=7^{2x}\\). Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other. We then divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which we obtain by factoring. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ x\\ln(3)+2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)-x\\ln(3)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&x(2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3))\\quad\\mbox{Factor}.\\\\ x&=&\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\end{array}\\] Graphing \\(f(x)=9\\cdot 3^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=7^{2x}\\) on the calculator, we see that these two graphs intersect at \\(x=\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\approx 0.7866\\).\n\n\n",

To graph \\(y=T(t)\\) using transformations, we start with the basic function, \\(f(t)=e^{t}\\). As we have already remarked, \\(e\\approx 2.718>1\\) so the graph of \\(f\\) is an increasing exponential with \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,1)\\) and horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\). The points \\(\\left(-1,e^{-1}\\right)\\approx(-1,0.37)\\) and \\((1,e)\\approx(1,2.72)\\) are also on the graph. Since the formula \\(T(t)\\) looks rather complicated, we rewrite \\(T(t)\\) in the form presented in Theorem 1.7 and use that result to track the changes to our three points and the horizontal asymptote. We have \\[T(t)=70+90e^{-0.1t}=90e^{-0.1t}+70=90f(-0.1t)+70\\] Multiplication of the input to \\(f\\), \\(t\\), by \\(-0.1\\) results in a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(10\\) as well as a reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. We divide each of the \\(x\\) values of our points by \\(-0.1\\) (which amounts to multiplying them by \\(-10\\)) to obtain \\(\\left(10,e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((-10,e)\\). Since none of these changes affected the \\(y\\) values, the horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we see that the output from \\(f\\) is being multiplied by \\(90\\). This results in a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(90\\). We multiply the \\(y\\)-coordinates by \\(90\\) to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,90)\\), and \\((-10,90e)\\). We also multiply the \\(y\\) value of the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) by \\(90\\), and it remains \\(y=0\\). Finally, we add \\(70\\) to all of the \\(y\\)-coordinates, which shifts the graph upwards to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}+70\\right)\\approx(10,103.11)\\), \\((0,160)\\), and \\((-10,90e+70)\\approx(-10,314.64)\\). Adding \\(70\\) to the horizontal asymptote shifts it upwards as well to \\(y=70\\). We connect these three points using the same shape in the same direction as in the graph of \\(f\\) and, last but not least, we restrict the domain to match the applied domain \\([0,\\infty)\\). The result is below.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe can write the chain rule in way that is somewhat closer to the single variable chain rule:\n\\[{df\\over dt}=\\langle f_{x},f_{y}\\rangle\\cdot\\langle x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}\\rangle,\\]\nor (roughly) the derivatives of the outside function \"times\" the derivatives of the inside functions.

Suppose that \\(f(x,y)\\) is a function and \\(x=g(s,t)\\) and \\(y=h(s,t)\\) are functions of two variables \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Then \\(f\\) is \"really\" a function of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) as well, and\n\\[{\\partial f\\over\\partial s}=f_{x}g_{s}+f_{y}h_{s}\\qquad{\\partial f\\over \\partial t}=f_{x}g_{t}+f_{y}h_{t}.\\]\nThe natural extension of this to \\(f(x,y,z)\\) works as well.\nRecall that we used the ordinary chain rule to do implicit differentiation. We can do the same with the new chain rule.\n**EXAMPLE 14.4.2**\\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) defines a sphere, which is not a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), though it can be thought of as two functions, the top and bottom hemispheres.

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSince \\(f_{x}=e^{z}\\), \\(f=xe^{z}+g(y,z)\\). Since \\(f_{y}=1\\), it must be that \\(g_{y}=1\\), so \\(g(y,z)=y+h(z)\\). Thus \\(f=xe^{z}+y+h(z)\\) and\n\\[xe^{z}=f_{z}=xe^{z}+0+h^{\\prime}(z),\\]\nso \\(h^{\\prime}(z)=0\\), i.e., \\(h(z)=C\\), and \\(f=xe^{z}+y+C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe can rewrite Green's Theorem using these new ideas; these rewritten versions in turn are closer to some later theorems we will see.\nSuppose we write a two dimensional vector field in the form \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,0\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Then\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\bf i}&{\\bf j}&{\\bf k}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial z}\\\\ P&Q&0\\end{array}\\right|=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle,\\]\nand so \\((\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf k}=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot\\langle 0,0,1 \\rangle=Q_{x}-P_{y}\\). So Green's Theorem says\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint_{D} Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA=\\iint_{D}(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf k}\\,dA.\\] (16.5.1)\nRoughly speaking, the right-most integral adds up the curl (tendency to swirl) at each point in the region; the left-most integral adds up the tangential components of the vector field around the entire boundary. Green's Theorem says these are equal, or roughly, that the sum of the \"microscopic\" swirls over the region is the same as the \"macroscopic\" swirl around the boundary.\nNext, suppose that the boundary \\(\\partial D\\) has a vector form \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)\\) is tangent to the boundary, and \\({\\bf T}={\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)/|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\) is the usual unit tangent vector. Writing \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) we get\n\\[{\\bf T}={\\langle x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}\\rangle\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}\\]\nand then\n\n\n",

To actually prove this analytically, we assume \\((x,y)\\) is a generic point on the graph of the equation. That is, we assume \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\) is true. As we learned in Section 1.1, the point symmetric to \\((x,y)\\) about the \\(y\\)-axis is \\((-x,y)\\). To show that the graph is\nsymmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis, we need to show that \\((-x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\), too. Substituting \\((-x,y)\\) into the equation gives\n\\[(-x)^{2}+(y)^{3} \\stackrel{{?}}{{=}} 1\\] \\[x^{2}+y^{3} \\stackrel{{\\vee}}{{=}} 1\\]\nSince we are assuming the original equation \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\) is true, we have shown that \\((-x,y)\\) satisfies the equation (since it leads to a true result) and hence is on the graph. In this way, we can check whether the graph of a given equation possesses any of the symmetries discussed in Section 1.1. We summarize the procedure in the following result.\n**Testing the Graph of an Equation for Symmetry**\nTo test the graph of an equation for symmetry\n* about the \\(y\\)-axis \\(\\,-\\,\\) substitute \\((-x,y)\\) into the equation and simplify. If the result is equivalent to the original equation, the graph is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nA second order differential equation is one containing the second derivative.

We make an inspired guess: might there be a solution of the form \\(e^{rt}\\)? This seems at least plausible, since in this case \\(\\ddot{y}\\), \\(\\dot{y}\\), and \\(y\\) all involve \\(e^{rt}\\).\n**470 Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nIf such a function is a solution then\n\\[\\eqalign{r^{2}e^{rt}-re^{rt}-2e^{rt}&=0\\cr e^{rt}(r^{2}-r-2)&=0\\cr(r^{2}-r-2)&=0 \\cr(r-2)(r+1)&=0,\\cr}\\]\nso \\(r\\) is \\(2\\) or \\(-1\\). Not only are \\(f=e^{2t}\\) and \\(g=e^{-t}\\) solutions, but notice that \\(y=Af+Bg\\) is also, for any constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{(Af+Bg)^{\\prime\\prime}-(Af+Bg)^{\\prime}-2(Af+Bg)&=Af^{\\prime\\prime}+ Bg^{\\prime\\prime}-Af^{\\prime}-Bg^{\\prime}-2Af-2Bg\\cr&=A(f^{\\prime\\prime}-f^{\\prime}-2f)+ B(g^{\\prime\\prime}-g^{\\prime}-2g)\\cr&=A(0)+B(0)=0.\\cr}\\]\nCan we find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that this is a solution to the initial value problem? Let's substitute:\n\\[5=y(0)=Af(0)+Bg(0)=Ae^{0}+Be^{0}=A+B\\]\nand\n\\[0=\\dot{y}(0)=Af^{\\prime}(0)+Bg^{\\prime}(0)=A2e^{0}+B(-1)e^{0}=2A-B.\\]\nSo we need to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that make both \\(5=A+B\\) and \\(0=2A-B\\) true. This is a simple set of simultaneous equations: solve \\(B=2A\\), substitute to get \\(5=A+2A=3A\\). Then \\(A=5/3\\) and \\(B=10/3\\), and the desired solution is \\((5/3)e^{2t}+(10/3)e^{-t}\\).

Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nHere we have replaced \\(a\\) by \\(t\\) in the first \\(N+1\\) terms of the Taylor series, and added a carefully chosen term on the end, with \\(B\\) to be determined. Note that we are temporarily keeping \\(x\\) fixed, so the only variable in this equation is \\(t\\), and we will be interested only in \\(t\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). Now substitute \\(t=a\\):\n\\[F(a)=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\,(x-a)^{n}+B(x-a)^{N+1}.\\]\nSet this equal to \\(f(x)\\):\n\\[f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\,(x-a)^{n}+B(x-a)^{N+1}.\\]\nSince \\(x\\neq a\\), we can solve this for \\(B\\), which is a \"constant\"--it depends on \\(x\\) and \\(a\\) but those are temporarily fixed. Now we have defined a function \\(F(t)\\) with the property that \\(F(a)=f(x)\\). Consider also \\(F(x)\\): all terms with a positive power of \\((x-t)\\) become zero when we substitute \\(x\\) for \\(t\\), so we are left with \\(F(x)=f^{(0)}(x)/0!=f(x)\\). So \\(F(t)\\) is a function with the same value on the endpoints of the interval \\([a,x]\\). By Rolle's theorem (6.5.1), we know that there is a value \\(z\\in(a,x)\\) such that \\(F^{\\prime}(z)=0\\). Let's look at \\(F^{\\prime}(t)\\). Each term in \\(F(t)\\), except the first term and the extra term involving \\(B\\), is a product, so to take the derivative we use the product rule on each of these terms. It will help to write out the first few terms of the definition:\n\\[F(t)=f(t) +\\frac{f^{(1)}(t)}{1!}(x-t)^{1}+\\frac{f^{(2)}(t)}{2!}(x-t)^{2}+ \\frac{f^{(3)}(t)}{3!}(x-t)^{3}+\\cdots\\] \\[+\\frac{f^{(N)}(t)}{N!}(x-t)^{N}+B(x-t)^{N+1}.\\]\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nNow take the derivative:\n\n\n",

Suppose two regions have the same areas. What is the value $c$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nA computer program that plots such surfaces can be very useful, as it is often difficult to get a good idea of what they look like. Still, it is valuable to be able to visualize relatively simple surfaces without such aids. As in the previous example, it is often a good idea to examine the function on restricted subsets of the plane, especially lines. It can also be useful to identify those points \\((x,y)\\) that share a common \\(z\\)-value.\n**EXAMPLE 14.1.4** Consider \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\). When \\(x=0\\) this becomes \\(f=y^{2}\\), a parabola in the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane; when \\(y=0\\) we get the \"same\" parabola \\(f=x^{2}\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) plane. Now consider the line \\(y=kx\\). If we simply replace \\(y\\) by \\(kx\\) we get \\(f(x,y)=(1+k^{2})x^{2}\\) which is a parabola, but it does not really \"represent\" the cross-section along \\(y=kx\\), because the cross-section has the line \\(y=kx\\) where the horizontal axis should be. In\norder to pretend that this line is the horizontal axis, we need to write the function in terms of the distance from the origin, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\\sqrt{x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}}\\). Now \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}=(\\sqrt{x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}})^{2}\\). So the cross-section is the \"same\" parabola as in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) and \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) planes, namely, the height is always the distance from the origin squared. This means that \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) can be formed by starting with \\(z=x^{2}\\) and rotating this curve around the \\(z\\) axis.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOf course, this is the integral we actually computed above, but we have now arrived at it directly rather than as a modification of the difference between two other integrals. In that example it really doesn't matter which approach we take, but in some cases this second approach is better.\n### Area between curves\n**Example 9.1.2**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+1\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\); these are the same curves as before but lowered by 2. In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips below the \\(x\\)-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area by rectangles. The height of a typical rectangle will still be \\(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i})\\), even if \\(g(x_{i})\\) is negative. Thus the area is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+1-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x -2\\,dx.\\]\nThis is of course the same integral as before, because the region between the curves is identical to the former region--it has just been moved down by 2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 9.1.3**: Find the area between \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}-6x+5\\) over the interval \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\); the curves are shown in figure 9.1.4.

However, we have proven that is not the case.\n6. Testing the graph of \\(y=p(x)\\) for symmetry is complicated by the fact \\(p(x)\\) is a piecewise-defined function. As always, we handle this by checking the condition for symmetry by checking it on each piece of the domain. We first consider the case when \\(x<0\\) and set about finding the correct expression for \\(p(-x)\\). Even though \\(p(x)=x+3\\) for \\(x<0\\), \\(p(-x)\\neq-x+3\\) here. The reason for this is that since \\(x<0\\), \\(-x>0\\) which means to find \\(p(-x)\\), we need to use the _other_ formula for \\(p(x)\\), namely \\(p(x)=-x+3\\). Hence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(p(-x)=-(-x)+3=x+3=p(x)\\). For \\(x\\geq 0\\), \\(p(x)=-x+3\\) and we have two cases. If \\(x>0\\), then \\(-x<0\\) so \\(p(-x)=(-x)+3=-x+3=p(x)\\). If \\(x=0\\), then \\(p(0)=3=p(-0)\\). Hence, in all cases, \\(p(-x)=p(x)\\), so \\(p\\) is even. Since \\(p(0)=3\\) but \\(p(-0)=p(0)=3\\neq-3\\), we also have \\(p\\) is not odd. While graphing \\(y=p(x)\\) is not onerous to do by hand, it is instructive to see how to enter this into our calculator. By using some of the logical commands,5 we have: Footnote 5: Consult your owner’s manual, instructor, or favorite video site!\nThe calculator bears shows that the graph appears to be symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n5 & \\((5,5)\\) & 5 & \\(f(5+2)=f(7)=?\\) & \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} When we substitute \\(x=4\\) into the formula \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\), we are asked to find \\(f(4+2)=f(6)\\) which doesn't exist because the domain of \\(f\\) is only \\([0,5]\\). The same thing happens when we attempt to find \\(g(5)\\). What we need here is a new strategy. We know, for instance, \\(f(0)=1\\). To determine the corresponding point on the graph of \\(g\\), we need to figure out what value of \\(x\\) we must substitute into \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\) so that the quantity \\(x+2\\), works out to be 0. Solving \\(x+2=0\\) gives \\(x=-2\\), and \\(g(-2)=f((-2)+2)=f(0)=1\\) so \\((-2,1)\\) is on the graph of \\(g\\). To use the fact \\(f(2)=3\\), we set \\(x+2=2\\) to get \\(x=0\\). Substituting gives \\(g(0)=f(0+2)=f(2)=3\\). Continuing in this fashion, we get\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\(x+2\\) & \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-2\\) & 0 & \\(g(-2)=f(0)=1\\) & \\((-2,1)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 2 & \\(g(0)=f(2)=3\\) & \\((0,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 4 & \\(g(2)=f(4)=3\\) & \\((2,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n3 & 5 & \\(g(3)=f(5)=5\\) & \\((3,5)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} In summary, the points \\((0,1)\\), \\((2,3)\\), \\((4,3)\\) and \\((5,5)\\) on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) give rise to the points \\((-2,1)\\), \\((0,3)\\), \\((2,3)\\) and \\((3,5)\\) on the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\), respectively.

The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nthe integrand \\(|{\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\) is the area of a tiny parallelogram, that is, a very small surface area, so it is reasonable to abbreviate it \\(dS\\); then a shortened version of the integral is\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\cdot dS.\\]\nWe have already seen that if \\(D\\) is a region in the plane, the area of \\(D\\) may be computed with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\cdot dA,\\]\nso this is really quite familiar, but the \\(dS\\) hides a little more detail than does \\(dA\\).\nJust as we can integrate functions \\(f(x,y)\\) over regions in the plane, using\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}f(x,y)\\,dA,\\]\nso we can compute integrals over surfaces in space, using\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}f(x,y,z)\\,dS.\\]\nIn practice this means that we have a vector function \\({\\bf r}(u,v)=\\langle x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)\\rangle\\) for the surface, and the integral we compute is\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))|{\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}| \\,du\\,dv.\\]\nThat is, we express everything in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), and then we can do an ordinary double integral.\n##### Example 16.7.1\nSuppose a thin object occupies the upper hemisphere of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1\\) and has density \\(\\sigma(x,y,z)=z\\). Find the mass and center of mass of the object. (Note that the object is just a thin shell; it does not occupy the interior of the hemisphere.)\nWe write the hemisphere as \\({\\bf r}(\\phi,\\theta)=\\langle\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\phi\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq\\phi\\leq\\pi/2\\) and \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi\\). So \\({\\bf r}_{\\theta}=\\langle-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf r}_{\\phi}=\\langle\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi,\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi,-\\sin\\phi\\rangle\\). Then\n\\[{\\bf r}_{\\theta}\\times{\\bf r}_{\\phi}=\\langle-\\cos\\theta\\sin^{2}\\phi,-\\sin \\theta\\sin^{2}\\phi,-\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi\\rangle\\]\nand\n\\[|{\\bf r}_{\\theta}\\times{\\bf r}_{\\phi}|=|\\sin\\phi|=\\sin\\phi,\\]\n\n\n",

Substituting \\(t=0\\) gives \\(P(0)=\\frac{100}{(5-0)^{2}}=4\\), which means 4000 bacteria are initially introduced into the environment.\n2. To find when the population reaches 100,000, we first need to remember that \\(P(t)\\) is measured in _thousands_. In other words, 100,000 bacteria corresponds to \\(P(t)=100\\). Substituting for \\(P(t)\\) gives the equation \\(\\frac{100}{(5-t)^{2}}=100\\). Clearing denominators and dividing by 100 gives \\((5-t)^{2}=1\\), which, after extracting square roots, produces \\(t=4\\) or \\(t=6\\). Of these two solutions, only \\(t=4\\) in our domain, so this is the solution we keep. Hence, it takes 4 days for the population of bacteria to reach 100,000.\n3. To determine the behavior of \\(P\\) as \\(t\\to 5^{-}\\), we can make a table\nIn other words, as \\(t\\to 5^{-}\\), \\(P(t)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, the line \\(t=5\\) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of \\(y=P(t)\\).

(AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\n\n",

To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\), we get \\(\\log_{2}(x)=-1\\), which gives us \\(x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\log_{2}(x)=3\\), which yields \\(x=2^{3}=8\\).

What is \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like \"the limit of \\((-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2})/\\Delta x\\) as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to zero is \\(-19.6\\),\" and abbreviate this mouthful\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nUsually \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the left\" and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the right\".\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.13**  Discuss \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\).\nThe function \\(f(x)=x/|x|\\) is undefined at 0; when \\(x>0\\), \\(|x|=x\\) and so \\(f(x)=1\\); when \\(x<0\\), \\(|x|=-x\\) and \\(f(x)=-1\\). Thus \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}-1=-1\\) while\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}1=1\\). The limit of \\(f(x)\\) must be equal to both the left and right limits; since they are different, the limit \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\) does not exist. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 2.3.\nCompute the limits.

(AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\n\n",

Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**8.** Find the derivative of \\(y=f(x)=2/\\sqrt{2x+1}\\Rightarrow\\)\n**9.** Find the derivative of \\(y=g(t)=(2t-1)/(t+2)\\Rightarrow\\)\n**10.** Find an equation for the tangent line to the graph of \\(f(x)=5-x-3x^{2}\\) at the point \\(x=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**11.** Find a value for \\(a\\) so that the graph of \\(f(x)=x^{2}+ax-3\\) has a horizontal tangent line at \\(x=4\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n### 2.5 Properties of Functions\nAs we have defined it in Section 1.3, a function is a very general object. At this point, it is useful to introduce a collection of properties of functions; knowing that a function has one of these properties can be very useful. Consider the graphs of the functions in Figure 2.5.1. It would clearly be useful to have words to help us describe the distinct features of each of them. We will point out and define a few properties (there are many more) of the functions pictured here. For the sake of the discussion, we will assume that the graphs do not exhibit any unusual behavior off-stage (i.e., outside the view of the graphs).\n**Functions.** Each graph in Figure 2.5.1 certainly represents a function--since each passes the _vertical line test_. In other words, as you sweep a vertical line across the graph of each function, the line never intersects the graph more than once. If it did, then the graph would not represent a function.\n\n\n",

Not surprisingly, non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more general equations.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) is a function of two variables. A more general class of first order differential equations has the form \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\). This is not necessarily a linear first order equation, since \\(\\phi\\) may depend on \\(y\\) in some complicated way; note however that \\(\\dot{y}\\) appears in a very simple form. Under suitable conditions on the function \\(\\phi\\), it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable property.\n##### Example 17.4.1\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\) is a first order non-linear equation, because \\(y\\) appears to the second power. We will not be able to solve this equation. \\(\\Box\\)\n##### Example 17.4.2\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\). Show that the steady state part of the solution has amplitude \\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(k-m\\omega^{2})^{2}+\\omega^{2}b^{2}}}.\\] Show that this amplitude is largest when \\(\\omega=\\frac{\\sqrt{4mk-2b^{2}}}{2m}\\). This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\n\n\n",

If it converges, compute the limit. Since \\(|\\sin n|\\leq 1\\), \\(0\\leq|\\sin n/\\sqrt{n}|\\leq 1/\\sqrt{n}\\) and we can use theorem 11.1.3 with \\(a_{n}=0\\) and \\(c_{n}=1/\\sqrt{n}\\).

In some cases we can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\nAgain we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know. So we look at \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\):\n\\[{a_{n+1}\\over a_{n}}={(n+1)!\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}{n^{n}\\over n!}={(n+1)!\\over n!} {n^{n}\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}={n+1\\over n+1}\\left({n\\over n+1}\\right)^{n}=\\left({n \\over n+1}\\right)^{n}<1.\\]\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSince \\(f_{x}=e^{z}\\), \\(f=xe^{z}+g(y,z)\\). Since \\(f_{y}=1\\), it must be that \\(g_{y}=1\\), so \\(g(y,z)=y+h(z)\\). Thus \\(f=xe^{z}+y+h(z)\\) and\n\\[xe^{z}=f_{z}=xe^{z}+0+h^{\\prime}(z),\\]\nso \\(h^{\\prime}(z)=0\\), i.e., \\(h(z)=C\\), and \\(f=xe^{z}+y+C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe can rewrite Green's Theorem using these new ideas; these rewritten versions in turn are closer to some later theorems we will see.\nSuppose we write a two dimensional vector field in the form \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,0\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Then\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\bf i}&{\\bf j}&{\\bf k}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}&\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}&\\frac{\\partial}{ \\partial z}\\\\ P&Q&0\\end{array}\\right|=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle,\\]\nand so \\((\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf k}=\\langle 0,0,Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot\\langle 0,0,1 \\rangle=Q_{x}-P_{y}\\). So Green's Theorem says\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint_{D} Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA=\\iint_{D}(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf k}\\,dA.\\] (16.5.1)\nRoughly speaking, the right-most integral adds up the curl (tendency to swirl) at each point in the region; the left-most integral adds up the tangential components of the vector field around the entire boundary. Green's Theorem says these are equal, or roughly, that the sum of the \"microscopic\" swirls over the region is the same as the \"macroscopic\" swirl around the boundary.\nNext, suppose that the boundary \\(\\partial D\\) has a vector form \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)\\) is tangent to the boundary, and \\({\\bf T}={\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)/|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\) is the usual unit tangent vector. Writing \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) we get\n\\[{\\bf T}={\\langle x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}\\rangle\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}\\]\nand then\n\n\n",

We start with\n\\[P(t)=\\int-\\cos t\\,dt=-\\sin t,\\]\nso the general solution to the differential equation is\n\\[y=Ae^{-\\sin t}.\\]\nTo compute \\(A\\) we substitute:\n\\[{1\\over 2}=Ae^{-\\sin 0}=A,\\]\nso the solutions is\n\\[y={1\\over 2}e^{-\\sin t}.\\]\nFor the second problem,\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAs you might guess, a first order linear differential equation has the form \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Not only is this closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Let \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\n\n\n",

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n**THEOREM 14.2.6** Polynomials are continuous everywhere.

As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\nWe can in fact turn this into a L'Hopital's Rule problem:\n\\[x\\ln x=\\frac{\\ln x}{1/x}=\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need.

Since \\(u=x^{2}\\), when \\(x=2\\), \\(u=4\\), and when \\(x=4\\), \\(u=16\\). So we can do this:\n\\[\\int_{2}^{4}x\\sin(x^{2})\\,dx=\\int_{4}^{16}\\frac{1}{2}\\sin u\\,du=\\left.-\\frac{1 }{2}(\\cos u)\\right|_{4}^{16}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(16)+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(4).\\]\nAn incorrect, and dangerous, alternative is something like this:\n\\[\\int_{2}^{4}x\\sin(x^{2})\\,dx=\\int_{2}^{4}\\frac{1}{2}\\sin u\\,du=\\left.-\\frac{1 }{2}\\cos(u)\\right|_{2}^{4}=\\left.-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(x^{2})\\right|_{2}^{4}=- \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(16)+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(4).\\]\nThis is incorrect because \\(\\int_{2}^{4}\\frac{1}{2}\\sin u\\,du\\) means that \\(u\\) takes on values between \\(2\\) and \\(4\\), which is wrong. It is dangerous, because it is very easy to get to the point \\(\\left.-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(u)\\right|_{2}^{4}\\) and forget\nto substitute \\(x^{2}\\) back in for \\(u\\), thus getting the incorrect answer \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(4)+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2)\\).

More generally, we'd like to have a formula to compute the derivative of** \\(f(x)/g(x)\\) **if we already know** \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) **and** \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\)**. Instead of attacking this problem head-on, let's notice that we've already done part of the problem:** \\(f(x)/g(x)=f(x)\\cdot(1/g(x))\\)**, that is, this is \"really\" a product, and we can compute the derivative if we know** \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) **and** \\((1/g(x))^{\\prime}\\)**. So really the only new bit of information we need is** \\((1/g(x))^{\\prime}\\) **in terms of** \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\)**. As with the product rule, let's set this up and see how\nfar we can get:\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}{1\\over g(x)}&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{1\\over g(x+\\Delta x)}-{1\\over g(x)} \\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{g(x)-g(x+\\Delta x)\\over g(x+\\Delta x)g(x)}\\cr&= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{g(x)-g(x+\\Delta x)\\over g(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\Delta x}\\cr&= \\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}-{g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\over\\Delta x}{1\\over g(x+\\Delta x)g(x)}\\cr&=-{ g^{\\prime}(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}}\\]\nNow we can put this together with the product rule:\n\\[{d\\over dx}{f(x)\\over g(x)}=f(x){-g^{\\prime}(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}+f^{\\prime}(x){ 1\\over g(x)}={-f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}={f^{\\prime} (x)g(x)-f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\over g(x)^{2}}.\\]\n**EXAMPLE 3.4.1** Compute the derivative of \\((x^{2}+1)/(x^{3}-3x)\\).\n\\[{d\\over dx}{x^{2}+1\\over x^{3}-3x}={2x(x^{3}-3x)-(x^{2}+1)(3x^{2}-3)\\over(x^{ 3}-3x)^{2}}={-x^{4}-6x^{2}+3\\over(x^{3}-3x)^{2}}.\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nIt is often possible to calculate derivatives in more than one way, as we have already seen.

As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.\n**THEOREM 11.4.1** Suppose that \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\). Then the alternating series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\) converges.\n_Proof._ The odd numbered partial sums, \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a non-increasing sequence, because \\(s_{2k+3}=s_{2k+1}-a_{2k+2}+a_{2k+3}\\leq s_{2k+1}\\), since \\(a_{2k+2}\\geq a_{2k+3}\\).

Some are quite easy to understand: If \\(r=1\\) the sequence converges to \\(1\\) since every term is \\(1\\), and likewise if \\(r=0\\) the sequence converges to \\(0\\). If \\(r=-1\\) this is the sequence of example 11.1.7 and diverges. If \\(r>1\\) or \\(r<-1\\) the terms \\(r^{n}\\) get large without limit, so the sequence diverges.

Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe can compute the integral:\n\\[\\int_{N}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\,dx=\\frac{1}{N},\\]\nso \\(N=100\\) is a good starting point. Adding up the first 100 terms gives approximately \\(1.634983900\\), and that plus \\(1/100\\) is \\(1.644983900\\), so approximating the series by the value halfway between these will be at most \\(1/200=0.005\\) in error. The midpoint is \\(1.639983900\\), but while this is correct to \\(\\pm 0.005\\), we can't tell if the correct two-decimal approximation is \\(1.63\\) or \\(1.64\\). We need to make \\(N\\) big enough to reduce the guaranteed error, perhaps to around \\(0.004\\) to be safe, so we would need \\(1/N\\approx 0.008\\), or \\(N=125\\). Now the sum of the first 125 terms is approximately \\(1.636965982\\), and that plus \\(0.008\\) is \\(1.644965982\\) and the point halfway between them is \\(1.640965982\\). The true value is then \\(1.640965982\\pm 0.004\\), and all numbers in this range round to \\(1.64\\), so \\(1.64\\) is correct to two decimal places. We have mentioned that the true value of this series can be shown to be \\(\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.644934068\\) which rounds down to \\(1.64\\) (just barely) and is indeed below the upper bound of \\(1.644965982\\), again just barely. Frequently approximations will be even better than the \"guaranteed\" accuracy, but not always, as this example demonstrates. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 11.3\n\n\n",

Is there a value $x$ between 10pi and 11pi such that $f'(x) = 0$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. We begin solving \\(2\\sin(x)\\leq 1\\) by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and zero on the other to get \\(2\\sin(x)-1\\leq 0\\). Next, we let \\(f(x)=2\\sin(x)-1\\) and note that our original inequality is equivalent to solving \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\). We now look to see where, if ever, \\(f\\) is undefined and where \\(f(x)=0\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, we can immediately set about finding the zeros of \\(f\\). Solving \\(f(x)=0\\), we have \\(2\\sin(x)-1=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). The solutions here are \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since we are restricting our attention to \\([0,2\\pi)\\), only \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) are of concern to us. Next, we choose test values in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) other than the zeros and determine if \\(f\\) is positive or negative there. For \\(x=0\\) we have \\(f(0)=-1\\), for \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) and for \\(x=\\pi\\) we get \\(f(\\pi)=-1\\). Since our original inequality is equivalent to \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\), we are looking for where the function is negative \\((-)\\) or \\(0\\), and we get the intervals \\(\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right]\\cup\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{6},2\\pi\\right)\\). We can confirm our answer graphically by seeing where the graph of \\(y=2\\sin(x)\\) crosses or is below the graph of \\(y=1\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.\n\n\n",

Suppose we wish to find the zeros of \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x+5\\). To solve the equation \\(x^{2}-2x+5=0\\), we note that the quadratic doesn't factor nicely, so we resort to the Quadratic Formula, Equation 2.5 and obtain\n\\[x=\\frac{-(-2)\\pm\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{-16}}{2}=\\frac {2\\pm 4i}{2}=1\\pm 2i.\\]\nTwo things are important to note. First, the zeros \\(1+2i\\) and \\(1-2i\\) are complex conjugates. If ever we obtain non-real zeros to a quadratic function with real coefficients, the zeros will be a complex conjugate pair. (Do you see why?) Next, we note that in Example 3.4.1, part 6, we found \\((x-[1+2i])(x-[1-2i])=x^{2}-2x+5\\). This demonstrates that the factor theorem holds even for non-real zeros, i.e, \\(x=1+2i\\) is a zero of \\(f\\), and, sure enough, \\((x-[1+2i])\\) is a factor of \\(f(x)\\). It turns out that polynomial division works the same way for all complex numbers, real and non-real alike, so the Factor and Remainder Theorems hold as well. But how do we know if a\ngeneral polynomial has any complex zeros at all? We have many examples of polynomials with no real zeros. Can there be polynomials with no zeros whatsoever? The answer to that last question is \"No.\" and the theorem which provides that answer is The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFrom the graph in figure 6.3.2 we guess \\(x_{0}=1\\) as a starting point, then using the formula we compute \\(x_{1}=1.310478030\\), \\(x_{2}=1.223929096\\), \\(x_{3}=1.176050900\\), \\(x_{4}=1.165926508\\), \\(x_{5}=1.165561636\\). So we guess that the first three places are correct, but that is not the same as saying 1.165 is correct to three decimal places--1.166 might be the correct, rounded approximation. How can we tell? We can substitute 1.165, 1.1655 and 1.166 into \\(\\tan x-2x\\); this gives \\(-0.002483652\\), \\(-0.000271247\\), \\(0.001948654\\). Since the first two are negative and the third is positive, \\(\\tan x-2x\\) crosses the \\(x\\) axis between 1.1655 and 1.166, so the correct value to three places is 1.166. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 6.3\nYou may want to use this Sage worksheet.\n1.

What is y(2)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[y={1\\over 2}e^{\\sin 2}e^{-\\sin t}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\n#### Example 17.2.4\nSolve the initial value problem \\(t\\dot{y}+3y=0\\), \\(y(1)=2\\), assuming \\(t>0\\).

To that end, we re-write \\(g(x)=12x+x^{3}=x^{3}+12x\\), and see that the degree of \\(g\\) is 3, the leading term is \\(x^{3}\\), the leading coefficient is 1 and the constant term is 0.\n3. We need to rewrite the formula for \\(h\\) so that it resembles the form given in Definition 3.2: \\(h(x)=\\frac{4-x}{5}=\\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{x}{5}=-\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{4}{5}\\). The degree of \\(h\\) is 1, the leading term is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}x\\), the leading coefficient is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) and the constant term is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n4. It may seem that we have some work ahead of us to get \\(p\\) in the form of Definition 3.2. However, it is possible to glean the information requested about \\(p\\) without multiplying out the entire expression \\((2x-1)^{3}(x-2)(3x+2)\\). The leading term of \\(p\\) will be the term which has the highest power of \\(x\\). The way to get this term is to multiply the terms with the highest power of \\(x\\) from each factor together - in other words, the leading term of \\(p(x)\\) is the product of the leading terms of the factors of \\(p(x)\\). Hence, the leading term of \\(p\\) is \\((2x)^{3}(x)(3x)=24x^{5}\\). This means that the degree of \\(p\\) is 5 and the leading coefficient is 24. As for the constant term, we can perform a similar trick. The constant term is obtained by multiplying the constant terms from each of the factors \\((-1)^{3}(-2)(2)=4\\).\n\n\n",

Assume that S is oriented upwards.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nas before. In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\iint_{D}(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{ \\bf N}\\,dS,\\]\nif \\(\\partial D\\) is oriented counter-clockwise relative to \\({\\bf N}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nNote how little has changed: \\({\\bf k}\\) becomes \\({\\bf N}\\), a unit normal to the surface (just as \\({\\bf k}\\) is a unit normal to the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\)-plane), and \\(dA\\) becomes \\(dS\\), since this is now a general surface integral. The phrase \"counter-clockwise relative to \\({\\bf N}\\)\" means roughly that if we take the direction of \\({\\bf N}\\) to be \"up\", then we go around the boundary counter-clockwise when viewed from \"above\". In many cases, this description is inadequate. A slightly more complicated but general description is this: imagine standing on the side of the surface considered positive; walk to the boundary and turn left. You are now following the boundary in the correct direction.\n**Example 16.8.2**: Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle e^{xy}\\cos z,x^{2}z,xy\\rangle\\) and the surface \\(D\\) be \\(x=\\sqrt{1-y^{2}-z^{2}}\\), oriented in the positive \\(x\\) direction. It quickly becomes apparent that the surface integral in Stokes's Theorem is intractable, so we try the line integral. The boundary of \\(D\\) is the unit circle in the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane, \\({\\bf r}=\\langle 0,\\cos u,\\sin u\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq u\\leq 2\\pi\\). The integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\langle e^{xy}\\cos z,x^{2}z,xy\\rangle\\cdot\\langle 0,-\\sin u, \\cos u\\rangle\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}0\\,du=0,\\]\nbecause \\(x=0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Since the first parametrization leaves off at \\(t=1\\), we shift the parameter in the second part so it starts at \\(t=1\\).

These two equations completely specify the curve, though the form \\(r=f(\\theta)\\) is simpler. The expanded form has the virtue that it can easily be generalized to describe a wider range of curves than can be specified in rectangular or polar coordinates.\nSuppose \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are functions. Then the equations \\(x=f(t)\\) and \\(y=g(t)\\) describe a curve in the plane. In the case of the polar coordinates equations, the variable \\(t\\) is replaced by \\(\\theta\\) which has a natural geometric interpretation. But \\(t\\) in general is simply an arbitrary variable, often called in this case a **parameter**, and this method of specifying a curve is known as **parametric equations**. One important interpretation of \\(t\\) is _time_. In this interpretation, the equations \\(x=f(t)\\) and \\(y=g(t)\\) give the position of an object at time \\(t\\).\nFigure 10.3.4: An area bounded by the spiral of Archimedes.\n**Example 10.4.1**: _Describe the path of an object that moves so that its position at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(x=\\cos t\\), \\(y=\\cos^{2}t\\).

Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from exercise 13 in section 17.1, \\(\\dot{y}=ky(M-y)\\): \\(y\\) is a population at time \\(t\\), \\(M\\) is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and \\(k\\) measures the reproduction rate of the population. Figure 17.4.4 shows a slope field for this equation\nthat is quite informative. It is apparent that if the initial population is smaller than \\(M\\) it rises to \\(M\\) over the long term, while if the initial population is greater than \\(M\\) it decreases to \\(M\\). It is quite easy to generate slope fields with Sage; follow the AP link in the figure caption.\n##### Exercises 17.4\nIn problems 1-4, compute the Euler approximations for the initial value problem for \\(0\\leq t\\leq 1\\) and \\(\\Delta t=0.2\\). Using Sage, generate the slope field first and attempt to sketch the solution curve. Then use Sage to compute better approximations with smaller values of \\(\\Delta t\\).\n**1.**\\(\\dot{y}=t/y\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**2.**\\(\\dot{y}=t+y^{3}\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**3.**\\(\\dot{y}=\\cos(t+y)\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**4.**\\(\\dot{y}=t\\ln y\\), \\(y(0)=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\nNot all differential equations that are important in practice can be solved exactly, so techniques have been developed to approximate solutions. We describe one such technique, **Euler's Method**, which is simple though not particularly useful compared to some more sophisticated techniques.\nSuppose we wish to approximate a solution to the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\), \\(y(t_{0})=y_{0}\\), for \\(t\\geq t_{0}\\). Under reasonable conditions on \\(\\phi\\), we know the solution exists, represented by a curve in the \\(t\\)-\\(y\\) plane; call this solution \\(f(t)\\). The point \\((t_{0},y_{0})\\) is of course on this curve. We also know the slope of the curve at this point, namely \\(\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\). If we follow the tangent line for a brief distance, we arrive at a point that should be almost on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), namely \\((t_{0}+\\Delta t,y_{0}+\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\Delta t)\\); call this point \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). Now we pretend, in effect, that this point really is on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), in which case we again know the slope of the curve through \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\), namely \\(\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\). So we can compute a new point, \\((t_{2},y_{2})=(t_{1}+\\Delta t,y_{1}+\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\Delta t)\\) that is a little farther along, still close to the graph of \\(f(t)\\) but probably not quite so close as \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). We can continue in this way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have an approximation \\((t_{n},y_{n})\\) for whatever time \\(t_{n}\\) we need. At each step we do essentially the same calculation, namely\n\n\n",

Using the factored form of \\(g(x)\\) above, we find the zeros to be the solutions of \\((2x-5)(x+1)=0\\). We obtain \\(x=\\frac{5}{2}\\) and \\(x=-1\\). Since both of these numbers are in the domain of \\(g\\), we have two \\(x\\)-intercepts, \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, we set \\(x=0\\) and find \\(y=g(0)=\\frac{5}{6}\\), so our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\).\n4. Since \\(g(x)\\) was given to us in lowest terms, we have, once again by Theorem 4.1 vertical asymptotes \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=3\\). Keeping in mind \\(g(x)=\\frac{(2x-5)(x+1)}{(x-3)(x+2)}\\), we proceed to our analysis near each of these values. * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(-9)(-1)}{(-5)(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\]\nso as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). On the flip side, as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to 3\\):_ As \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number just shy of \\(3\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(1)(4)}{(\\text{ very small }(-))(5)}\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{ very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] Hence, as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, we have (again, without labels on the \\(y\\)-axis) 5. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator of \\(g(x)\\) are the same, we know from Theorem 4.2 that we can find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of \\(g\\) by taking the ratio of the leading terms coefficients, \\(y=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\). However, if we take the time to do a more detailed analysis, we will be able to reveal some 'hidden' behavior which would be lost otherwise.11 As in the discussion following Theorem 4.2, we use the result of the long division \\(\\left(2x^{2}-3x-5\\right)\\div\\left(x^{2}-x-6\\right)\\) to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-3x-5}{x^{2}-x-6}\\) as \\(g(x)=2-\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}.\\) We focus our attention on the term \\(\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}\\).

Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\). So the question becomes: what happens between \\(-2\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\)? Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than \\(4\\cdot 4\\) which is clearly larger than \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), this settles the question.)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFigure 6.1.1: The function \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) restricted to \\([-2,1]\\)\nIt is possible that there is no global maximum or minimum. It is difficult, and not particularly useful, to express a complete procedure for determining whether this is the case. Generally, the best approach is to gain enough understanding of the shape of the graph to decide. Fortunately, only a rough idea of the shape is usually needed.\nThere are some particularly nice cases that are easy. A continuous function on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\)_always_ has both a global maximum and a global minimum, so examining the critical values and the endpoints is enough:\n**Theorem 6.1.2**Extreme value theorem**  If \\(f\\) is continuous on a closed interval \\([a,b]\\), then it has both a minimum and a maximum point. That is, there are real numbers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in \\([a,b]\\) so that for every \\(x\\) in \\([a,b]\\), \\(f(x)\\leq f(c)\\) and \\(f(x)\\geq f(d)\\).\nAnother easy case: If a function is continuous and has a single critical value, then if there is a local maximum at the critical value it is a global maximum, and if it is a local minimum it is a global minimum. There may also be a global minimum in the first case, or a global maximum in the second case, but that will generally require more effort to determine.\n\n\n",

This means that if we want to compute \\(y^{\\prime}\\) for some particular value of \\(x\\) we'll have to know or compute \\(y\\) at that value of \\(x\\) as well. It is at this point that we will need to know whether \\(y\\) is \\(U(x)\\) or \\(L(x)\\). Occasionally it will turn out that we can avoid explicit use of \\(U(x)\\) or \\(L(x)\\) by the nature of the problem.\n**EXAMPLE 4.8.1** Find the slope of the circle \\(4=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) at the point \\((1,-\\sqrt{3})\\). Since we know both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of the point of interest, we do not need to explicitly recognize that this point is on \\(L(x)\\), and we do not need to use \\(L(x)\\) to compute \\(y\\)--but we could.

We could then take the derivative of \\(L(x)\\), using the power rule and the chain rule, to get\n\\[L^{\\prime}(x)=-{1\\over 2}(4-x^{2})^{-1/2}(-2x)={x\\over\\sqrt{4-x^{2}}}.\\]\nThen we could compute \\(L^{\\prime}(1)=1/\\sqrt{3}\\) by substituting \\(x=1\\).\nAlternately, we could realize that the point is on \\(L(x)\\), but use the fact that \\(y^{\\prime}=-x/y\\). Since the point is on \\(L(x)\\) we can replace \\(y\\) by \\(L(x)\\) to get\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nOf course, as we've already seen, we're primarily interested in limits that aren't so easy, namely, limits in which a denominator approaches zero. There are a handful of algebraic tricks that work on many of these limits.\n**Example 2.3.8**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x^{2}+2x-3}{x-1}\\). We can't simply plug in \\(x=1\\) because that makes the denominator zero. However:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{x^{2}+2x-3}{x-1}&=\\lim_{x\\to 1}\\frac{(x-1)(x+3)}{x-1} \\cr&=\\lim_{x\\to 1}(x+3)=4\\cr}\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nWhile theorem 2.3.6 is very helpful, we need a bit more to work easily with limits. Since the theorem applies when some limits are already known, we need to know the behavior of some functions that cannot themselves be constructed from the simple arithmetic operations of the theorem, such as \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Also, there is one other extraordinarily useful way to put functions together: composition. If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are functions, we can form two functions by composition: \\(f(g(x))\\) and \\(g(f(x))\\). For example, if \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}+5\\), then \\(f(g(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}+5}\\) and \\(g(f(x))=(\\sqrt{x})^{2}+5=x+5\\). Here is a companion to theorem 2.3.6 for composition:\n**Theorem 2.3.9**: Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=f(L)\\). Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a}f(g(x))=f(L).\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nNote the special form of the condition on \\(f\\): it is not enough to know that \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=M\\), though it is a bit tricky to see why. Many of the most familiar functions do have this property, and this theorem can therefore be applied. For example:\n**Theorem 2.3.10**: Suppose that \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Then\n\n\n",

(AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\n\n",

Then by Theorem 12.4.2 the cross product is\n\\[\\eqalign{{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\times{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T }\\times(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime}{\\bf T}+|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}) \\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}\\times|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime\\prime}{\\bf T}+| {\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}\\times|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{ \\prime}||{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{\\prime}({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T})+|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{ 2}({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T}^{\\prime})\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{2}({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T }^{\\prime})\\cr}\\]\nbecause \\({\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T}={\\bf 0}\\), since \\({\\bf T}\\) is parallel to itself. Then\n\\[\\eqalign{|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\times{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}|&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{ 2}|{\\bf T}\\times{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{2}|{\\bf T}||{\\bf T}^{ \\prime}|\\sin\\theta\\cr&=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{2}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\cr}\\]\nusing exercise 8 in section 13.2 to see that \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\). Dividing both sides by \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|^{3}\\) then gives the desired formula.\nWe used the fact here that \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}\\) is perpendicular to \\({\\bf T}\\); the vector \\({\\bf N}={\\bf T}^{\\prime}/|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\) is thus a unit vector perpendicular to \\({\\bf T}\\), called the **unit normal** to the curve. Occasionally of use is the **unit binormal**\\({\\bf B}={\\bf T}\\times{\\bf N}\\), a unit vector perpendicular to both \\({\\bf T}\\) and \\({\\bf N}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this chapter we will discuss the properties of the tangent plane.\nIn this chapter we will discuss the properties of the tangent plane.\nof the \\(z\\) component to the \\(x\\) component is the slope of the tangent line, precisely what we know how to compute. The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\). This point is on the upper hemisphere, so we use \\(f(x,y)=\\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\). Then \\(f_{x}(x,y)=-x(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\) and \\(f_{y}(x,y)=-y(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\), so \\(f_{x}(1,1)=f_{y}(1,1)=-1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and the equation of the plane is\n\\[z=-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(x-1)-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(y-1)+\\sqrt{2}.\\]\nThe hemisphere and this tangent plane are pictured in figure 14.3.3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it appears that to find a tangent plane, we need only find two quite simple ordinary derivatives, namely \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\). This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n\n\n",

For example, we can see that this is not true for function values near \\(x=-1\\) on the graph in (a) which is not continuous at that location.\nFigure 2.5.1: Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c) a bounded, differentiable function, (d) an unbounded, differentiable function\n**Definition 2.5.2**: **Continuous at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.3**: **Continuous** A function \\(f\\) is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. \\(\\Box\\)\nStrangely, we also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**.

As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\n\n\n",

To find \\(h(60)\\), we note that \\(t=60\\) satisfies \\(t>20\\), so we use the rule \\(h(t)=0\\). This function returns a value of \\(0\\) regardless of what value is substituted in for \\(t\\), so \\(h(60)=0\\). This means that \\(60\\) seconds after lift-off, the rocket is \\(0\\) feet above the ground; in other words, a minute after lift-off, the rocket has already returned to Earth.\n2. Since the function \\(h\\) is defined in pieces, we need to solve \\(h(t)=375\\) in pieces. For \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), so for these values of \\(t\\), we solve \\(-5t^{2}+100t=375\\). Rearranging terms, we get \\(5t^{2}-100t+375=0\\), and factoring gives \\(5(t-5)(t-15)=0\\). Our answers are \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\), and since both of these values of \\(t\\) lie between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\), we keep both solutions. For \\(t>20\\), \\(h(t)=0\\), and in this case, there are no solutions to \\(0=375\\). In terms of the model rocket, solving \\(h(t)=375\\) corresponds to finding when, if ever, the rocket reaches \\(375\\) feet above the ground. Our two answers, \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\) correspond to the rocket reaching this altitude _twice_ - once \\(5\\) seconds after launch, and again \\(15\\) seconds after launch.12\n\n\n",

To begin, we rewrite \\(4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)>\\pi\\) as \\(4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi>0\\). We let \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi\\), and note the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). To find the zeros of \\(f\\), we set \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi=0\\) and solve. We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), and since \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arccotangent, we may apply Theorem 10.27 and solve \\[\\operatorname{arccot}(3x) = \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[3x = 1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\operatorname{cot}( \\operatorname{arccot}(u))=u.\\] \\[x = \\tfrac{1}{3}\\] Next, we make a sign diagram for \\(f\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, and there is only one zero of \\(f\\), \\(x=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we have two test intervals, \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\infty\\right)\\). Ideally, we wish to find test values \\(x\\) in these intervals so that \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(4x)\\) corresponds to one of our off-used 'common' angles. After a bit of computation,18 we choose \\(x=0\\) for \\(x<\\frac{1}{3}\\) and for \\(x>\\frac{1}{3}\\), we choose \\(x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). We find \\(f(0)=\\pi>0\\) and \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{3}<0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi>0\\), we get our answer \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\). To check graphically, we use the technique in number 2c of Example 10.6.5 in Section 10.6 to graph \\(y=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)\\) and we see it is above the horizontal line \\(y=\\pi\\) on \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\left(-\\infty,0.\\overline{3}\\right)\\).\nFootnote 18: Set \\(3x\\) equal to the cotangents of the ‘common angles’ and choose accordingly.\n#### Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 18, find all of the exact solutions of the equation and then list those solutions which are in the interval \\(\\left[0,2\\pi\\right)\\).\n1. \\(\\sin\\left(5x\\right)=0\\) \\(2.\\)\\(\\cos\\left(3x\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) \\(3.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(-2x\\right)=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\tan\\left(6x\\right)=1\\) \\(5.\\)\\(\\csc\\left(4x\\right)=-1\\) \\(6.\\)\\(\\sec\\left(3x\\right)=\\sqrt{2}\\)\n3. \\(\\cot\\left(2x\\right)=-\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) \\(8.\\)\\(\\cos\\left(9x\\right)=9\\) \\(9.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{x}{3}\\right)=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n4. \\(\\cos\\left(x+\\dfrac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)=0\\) \\(11.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(2x-\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) \\(12.\\)\\(2\\cos\\left(x+\\dfrac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\sqrt{3}\\)\n5. \\(\\csc(x)=0\\) \\(14.\\)\\(\\tan\\left(2x-\\pi\\right)=1\\) \\(15.\\)\\(\\tan^{2}\\left(x\\right)=3\\)\n6. \\(\\sec^{2}\\left(x\\right)=\\dfrac{4}{3}\\) \\(17.\\)\\(\\cos^{2}\\left(x\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) \\(18.\\)\\(\\sin^{2}\\left(x\\right)=\\dfrac{3}{4}\\)\nIn Exercises 19 - 42, solve the equation, giving the exact solutions which lie in \\(\\left[0,2\\pi\\right)\\)\n19. \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(21.\\)\\(\\sin\\left(2x\\right)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(22.\\)\\(\\cos\\left(2x\\right)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\)\n23. \\(\\cos\\left(2x\\right)=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) \\(24.\\)\\(\\cos(2x)=2-5\\cos(x)\\)\n26. \\(\\cos(2x)=5\\sin(x)-2\\)\n28. \\(2\\sec^{2}(x)=3-\\tan(x)\\)\n30. \\(\\cot^{2}(x)=3\\csc(x)-3\\)\n32. \\(\\cos(x)\\csc(x)\\cot(x)=6-\\cot^{2}(x)\\)\n34. \\(\\cot^{4}(x)=4\\csc^{2}(x)-7\\)\n36. \\(\\tan^{3}\\left(x\\right)=3\\tan\\left(x\\right)\\)\n38. \\(\\cos^{3}\\left(x\\right)=-\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\)\n40. \\(\\csc^{3}(x)+\\csc^{2}(x)=4\\csc(x)+4\\)\n42. \\(\\tan\\left(x\\right)=\\sec\\left(x\\right)\\)\nIn Exercises 43 - 58, solve the equation, giving the exact solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\)\n1. \\(\\sin(6x)\\cos(x)=-\\cos(6x)\\sin(x)\\) 1. \\(\\sin(3x)\\cos(x)=\\cos(3x)\\sin(x)\\)\n2. \\(\\cos(2x)\\cos(x)+\\sin(2x)\\sin(x)=1\\) 2. \\(\\sin(x)+\\cos(x)=1\\) 3. \\(\\sqrt{2}\\cos(x)-\\sqrt{2}\\sin(x)=1\\) 4. \\(\\cos(2x)-\\sqrt{3}\\sin(2x)=\\sqrt{2}\\) 4. \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\) 5. \\(\\sin(5x)=\\sin(3x)\\) 5. \\(\\sin(6x)+\\sin(x)=0\\)\nIn Exercises 59 - 68, solve the equation.\n1. \\(\\arccos(2x)=\\pi\\)\n2. \\(4\\arctan(3x-1)-\\pi=0\\)\n3. \\(4\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi\\)\n4. \\(9\\arcsin^{2}(x)-\\pi^{2}=0\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn Example 10.3.3 number 6 above, we see that multiplying \\(1-\\cos(\\theta)\\) by \\(1+\\cos(\\theta)\\) produces a difference of squares that can be simplified to one term using Theorem 10.8. This is exactly the same kind of phenomenon that occurs when we multiply expressions such as \\(1-\\sqrt{2}\\) by \\(1+\\sqrt{2}\\) or \\(3-4i\\) by \\(3+4i\\). (Can you recall instances from Algebra where we did such things?) For this reason, the quantities \\((1-\\cos(\\theta))\\) and \\((1+\\cos(\\theta))\\) are called 'Pythagorean Conjugates.' Below is a list of other common Pythagorean Conjugates.\n**Pythagorean Conjugates**\n* \\(1-\\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(1+\\cos(\\theta)\\): \\((1-\\cos(\\theta))(1+\\cos(\\theta))=1-\\cos^{2}(\\theta)=\\sin^{2}(\\theta)\\)\n* \\(1-\\sin(\\theta)\\) and \\(1+\\sin(\\theta)\\): \\((1-\\sin(\\theta))(1+\\sin(\\theta))=1-\\sin^{2}(\\theta)=\\cos^{2}(\\theta)\\)\n* \\(\\sec(\\theta)-1\\) and \\(\\sec(\\theta)+1\\): \\((\\sec(\\theta)-1)(\\sec(\\theta)+1)=\\sec^{2}(\\theta)-1=\\tan^{2}(\\theta)\\)\n* \\(\\sec(\\theta)-\\tan(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sec(\\theta)+\\tan(\\theta)\\): \\((\\sec(\\theta)-\\tan(\\theta))(\\sec(\\theta)+\\tan(\\theta))=\\sec^{2}(\\theta)-\\tan^{ 2}(\\theta)=1\\)\n* \\(\\csc(\\theta)-1\\) and \\(\\csc(\\theta)+1\\): \\((\\csc(\\theta)-1)(\\csc(\\theta)+1)=\\csc^{2}(\\theta)-1=\\cot^{2}(\\theta)\\)\n* \\(\\csc(\\theta)-\\cot(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\csc(\\theta)+\\cot(\\theta)\\): \\((\\csc(\\theta)-\\cot(\\theta))(\\csc(\\theta)+\\cot(\\theta))=\\csc^{2}(\\theta)-\\cot^{ 2}(\\theta)=1\\)\nVerifying trigonometric identities requires a healthy mix of tenacity and inspiration. You will need to spend many hours struggling with them just to become proficient in the basics. Like many things in life, there is no short-cut here - there is no complete algorithm for verifying identities. Nevertheless, a summary of some strategies which may be helpful (depending on the situation) is provided below and ample practice is provided for you in the Exercises.\n**Strategies for Verifying Identities**\n* Try working on the more complicated side of the identity.\n* Use the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities in Theorem 10.6 to write functions on one side of the identity in terms of the functions on the other side of the identity. Simplify the resulting complex fractions.\n* Add rational expressions with unlike denominators by obtaining common denominators.\n* Use the Pythagorean Identities in Theorem 10.8 to 'exchange' sines and cosines, secants and tangents, cosecants and cotangents, and simplify sums or differences of squares to one term.\n\n\n",

(From another point of view, what we've done is prove that the volume of a sphere of radius 2 is \\((32/3)\\).

As with rectangular coordinates, we can adapt the method to deal with more complicated regions.\n**Example 15.2.2** Find the volume under \\(z=\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\) above the region enclosed by the curve \\(r=2\\cos\\theta\\), \\(-\\pi/2\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi/2\\); see figure 15.2.2. The region is described in polar coordinates by the inequalities \\(-\\pi/2\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi/2\\) and \\(0\\leq r\\leq 2\\cos\\theta\\), so the double integral is\n\\[\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{2\\cos\\theta}\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\ r\\,dr\\,d\\theta=2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{2\\cos\\theta}\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\ r\\,dr\\,d\\theta.\\]\nWe can rewrite the integral as shown because of the symmetry of the volume; this avoids a complication during the evaluation.

In the case of functions of two variables, things are a bit harder to understand. If we think of a function of two variables in terms of its graph, a surface, there is a more-or-less obvious derivative-like question we might ask, namely, how \"steep\" is the surface. But it's not clear that this has a simple answer, nor how we might proceed. We will start with what seem to be very small steps toward the goal; surprisingly, it turns out that these simple ideas hold the keys to a more general understanding.\nImagine a particular point on a surface; what might we be able to say about how steep it is? We can limit the question to make it more familiar: how steep is the surface in a particular direction? What does this even mean? Here's one way to think of it: Suppose we're interested in the point \\((a,b,c)\\). Pick a straight line in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane through the point \\((a,b,0)\\), then extend the line vertically into a plane. Look at the intersection of the\n\n\n",

What is h''(x) when x = 1?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nFootnote 6: In Calculus, we will see how these ‘holes’ can be ‘plugged’ when embarking on a more advanced study of continuity.\nNeither \\(x=-1\\) nor \\(x=1\\) are in the domain of \\(h\\), yet the behavior of the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) is drastically different near these \\(x\\)-values. The reason for this lies in the second to last step when we simplified the formula for \\(h(x)\\) in Example 4.1.1, where we had \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\). The reason \\(x=-1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) is because the factor \\((x+1)\\) appears in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\); similarly, \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) because of the factor \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\). The major difference between these two factors is that \\((x-1)\\) cancels with a factor in the numerator whereas \\((x+1)\\) does not. Loosely speaking, the trouble caused by \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator is canceled away while the factor \\((x+1)\\) remains to cause mischief. This is why the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) but only a hole at \\(x=1\\). These observations are generalized and summarized in the theorem below, whose proof is found in Calculus.\n**Theorem 4.1**.: **Location of Vertical Asymptotes and Holes:**_a_ Suppose \\(r\\) is a rational function which can be written as \\(r(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have no common zeros.b Let \\(c\\) be a real number which is not in the domain of \\(r\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nthe \\(x\\)-axis at \\((-1,0)\\). It should make you uncomfortable plugging \\(x=-1\\) into the reduced formula for \\(h(x)\\), especially since we've made such a big deal concerning the stipulation about not letting \\(x=-1\\) for that formula. What we are really doing is taking a Calculus short-cut to the more detailed kind of analysis near \\(x=-1\\) which we will show below. Speaking of which, for the discussion that follows, we will use the formula \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x+1)(x+1)}{x+2}\\), \\(x\\neq-1\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=h(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\).

On the other side of \\(-2\\), as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we find that \\(h(x)\\approx\\frac{3}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\) very big \\((+)\\), so \\(h(x)\\to\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=h(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-1\\)._ As \\(x\\to-1^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number a bit less than \\(x=-1\\).

Of course, this integral is also the result of an approximation, in which we add up volumes of boxes that are \\(\\Delta r\\times\\Delta\\theta\\times\\hbox{height}\\); the problem is that the height that will give us the correct answer is not simply \\(r\\). Or put another way, we can think of the correct height as \\(r\\), but the area of the base \\(\\Delta r\\Delta\\theta\\) as being wrong. The height \\(r\\) comes from equation 15.7.1, which is to say, it is precisely the same as the corresponding height in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) version of the integral. The problem is that the area of the base \\(\\Delta x\\times\\Delta y\\) is not the same as the area of the base \\(\\Delta r\\times\\Delta\\theta\\). We can think of the \"?\" in the integral as a correction factor that is needed so that \\(?\\,dr\\,d\\theta=dx\\,dy\\).\n\n\n",

The reasoning is this: we know that problem one can be solved easily by finding a function whose derivative is \\(3t\\). We also know that mathematically the two problems are the same, because both can be solved by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore, we don't really need to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer by computing a function with the derivative \\(3t\\) or, which is the same thing, \\(3x\\).\nIt's true that the first problem had the added complication of the \"10\", and we certainly need to be able to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple.

There may also be a global minimum in the first case, or a global maximum in the second case, but that will generally require more effort to determine.\n**Example 6.1.3**  Let \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x-3\\).

As we see, we get entirely different results. Along these lines, note that \\(f(x+2)\\), \\(f(x)+2\\) and \\(f(x)+f(2)\\) are three _different_ expressions as well. Even though function notation uses parentheses, as does multiplication, there is _no_ general 'distributive property' of function notation. Finally, note the practice of using parentheses when substituting one algebraic expression into another; we highly recommend this practice as it will reduce careless errors.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### Exponential Equations and Inequalities\nIn this section we will develop techniques for solving equations involving exponential functions. Suppose, for instance, we wanted to solve the equation \\(2^{x}=128\\). After a moment's calculation, we find \\(128=2^{7}\\), so we have \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\). The one-to-one property of exponential functions, detailed in Theorem 6.4, tells us that \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\) if and only if \\(x=7\\). This means that not only is \\(x=7\\) a solution to \\(2^{x}=2^{7}\\), it is the _only_ solution. Now suppose we change the problem ever so slightly to \\(2^{x}=129\\). We could use one of the inverse properties of exponentials and logarithms listed in Theorem 6.3 to write \\(129=2^{\\log_{2}(129)}\\). We'd then have \\(2^{x}=2^{\\log_{2}(129)}\\), which means our solution is \\(x=\\log_{2}(129)\\). This makes sense because, after all, the definition of \\(\\log_{2}(129)\\) is 'the exponent we put on \\(2\\) to get \\(129\\).' Indeed we could have obtained this solution directly by rewriting the equation \\(2^{x}=129\\) in its logarithmic form \\(\\log_{2}(129)=x\\). Either way, in order to get a reasonable decimal approximation to this number, we'd use the change of base formula, Theorem 6.7, to give us something more calculator friendly,1 say \\(\\log_{2}(129)=\\frac{\\ln(129)}{\\ln(2)}\\). Another way to arrive at this answer is as follows\nFootnote 1: You can use natural logs or common logs. We choose natural logs. (In Calculus, you’ll learn these are the most ‘mathy’ of the logarithms.)\n\n\n",

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAt the very last step we have used theorems 2.3.9 and 2.3.10. \\(\\Box\\)\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

The damped portion is called the **transient** part of the solution, and the simple oscillation is called the **steady state** part of the solution. A physical example is a mass-spring system. If the only force on the mass is due to the spring, then the behavior of the system is a damped oscillation. If in addition an external force is applied to the mass, and if the force varies according to a function of the form \\(a\\cos(\\omega t)+b\\sin(\\omega t)\\), then the long term behavior will be a simple oscillation determined by the steady state part of the general solution; the initial position of the mass will not matter. \\(\\Box\\)\nAs with the exponential form, such a simple guess may not work.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.7**: Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+16y=-\\sin(4t)\\).

This means we consider only the positive half of the number line for our sign diagram. On \\((0,\\infty)\\), \\(r\\) is defined everywhere so we need only look for zeros of \\(r\\). Setting \\(r(x)=0\\) gives \\(150-20x=0\\), so that \\(x=\\frac{15}{2}=7.5\\). The test intervals on our domain are \\((0,7.5)\\) and \\((7.5,\\infty)\\). We find \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\((7.5,\\infty)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\text{\\textdagger}&(+)&0&(-)\\\\ \\hline\\\\ 0&7.5\\end{array}\\] In the context of the problem, \\(x\\) represents the number of PortaBoy games systems produced and \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\) is the average cost to produce each system. Solving \\(\\overline{C}(x)<100\\) means we are trying to find how many systems we need to produce so that the average cost is less than $100 per system. Our solution, \\((7.5,\\infty)\\) tells us that we need to produce more than 7.5 systems to achieve this. Since it doesn't make sense to produce half a system, our final answer is \\([8,\\infty)\\).\n3. When we apply Theorem 4.2 to \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\) we find that \\(y=80\\) is a horizontal asymptote to the graph of \\(y=\\overline{C}(x)\\). To more precisely determine the behavior of \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\) as \\(x\\to\\infty\\), we first use long division7 and rewrite \\(\\overline{C}(x)=80+\\frac{150}{x}\\). As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), \\(\\frac{150}{x}\\to 0^{+}\\), which means \\(\\overline{C}(x)\\approx 80+\\text{very small}\\)\\((+)\\). Thus the average cost per system is getting closer to $80 per system. If we set \\(\\overline{C}(x)=80\\), we get \\(\\frac{150}{x}=0\\), which is impossible, so we conclude that \\(\\overline{C}(x)>80\\) for all \\(x>0\\). This means that the average cost per system is always greater than $80 per system, but the average cost is approaching this amount as more and more systems are produced. Looking back at Example 2.1.5, we realize $80 is the variable cost per system\n\n\n",

In the first, the inner integral is easy, because we need an anti-derivative with respect to \\(y\\), and the entire integrand \\(\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) is constant with respect to \\(y\\). Of course, the outer integral may be more difficult. In the second, the inner integral is mildly unpleasant--a trig substitution.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nWhat is (sin(2x) / x)^(1+x) when x is approaching 0?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nBefore we introduce the technique, we will also expand our concept of limit, in two ways. When the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) does not exist, it may be useful to note in what way it does not exist. We have already talked about one such case: one-sided limits. Another case is when \"\\(f\\) goes to infinity\". We also will occasionally want to know what happens to \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) \"goes to infinity\".\n**Example 4.10.1**: What happens to \\(1/x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(0\\)? From the right, \\(1/x\\) gets bigger and bigger, or goes to infinity. From the left it goes to negative infinity. \\(\\sqcap\\)__\n**Example 4.10.2**: What happens to the function \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity? It seems clear that as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger, \\(1/x\\) gets closer and closer to zero, so \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) should be getting closer and closer to \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)__\nAs with ordinary limits, these concepts can be made precise. Roughly, we want \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) to mean that we can make \\(f(x)\\) arbitrarily large by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) should mean we can make \\(f(x)\\) as close as we want to \\(L\\) by making \\(x\\) large enough. Compare this definition to the definition of limit in section 2.3, definition 2.3.2.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\frac{f^{(N+1)}(z)}{(N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}?\\]\nEvery derivative of \\(\\sin x\\) is \\(\\pm\\sin x\\) or \\(\\pm\\cos x\\), so \\(|f^{(N+1)}(z)|\\leq 1\\). The factor \\((x-a)^{N+1}\\) is a bit more difficult, since \\(x-a\\) could be quite large. Let's pick \\(a=0\\) and \\(|x|\\leq\\pi/2\\); if we can compute \\(\\sin x\\) for \\(x\\in[-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]\\), we can of course compute \\(\\sin x\\) for all \\(x\\).\nWe need to pick \\(N\\) so that\n\\[\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|<0.005.\\]\nSince we have limited \\(x\\) to \\([-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]\\),\n\\[\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|<\\frac{2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}.\\]\nThe quantity on the right decreases with increasing \\(N\\), so all we need to do is find an \\(N\\) so that\n\\[\\frac{2^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}<0.005.\\]\nA little trial and error shows that \\(N=8\\) works, and in fact \\(2^{9}/9!<0.0015\\), so\n\\[\\sin x =\\sum_{n=0}^{8}\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\,x^{n}\\pm 0.0015\\] \\[=x-\\frac{x^{3}}{6}+\\frac{x^{5}}{120}-\\frac{x^{7}}{5040}\\pm 0.0015.\\]\nFigure 11.11.1 shows the graphs of \\(\\sin x\\) and and the approximation on \\([0,3\\pi/2]\\). As \\(x\\) gets larger, the approximation heads to negative infinity very quickly, since it is essentially acting like \\(-x^{7}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nWe can extract a bit more information from this example. If we do not limit the value of \\(x\\), we still have\n\\[\\left|\\frac{f^{(N+1)}(z)}{(N+1)!}x^{N+1}\\right|\\leq\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|\\]\nso that \\(\\sin x\\) is represented by\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\,x^{n}\\pm\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!} \\right|.\\]\nIf we can show that\n\\[\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|=0\\]\nfor each \\(x\\) then\n\\[\\sin x=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\,x^{n}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1) ^{n}\\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!},\\]\nthat is, the sine function is actually equal to its Maclaurin series for all \\(x\\). How can we prove that the limit is zero? Suppose that \\(N\\) is larger than \\(|x|\\), and let \\(M\\) be the largest integer less than \\(|x|\\) (if \\(M=0\\) the following is even easier). Then\n\n\n",
