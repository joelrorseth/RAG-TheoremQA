        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nFind the x value of the solutions to the linear system: 7x - y = 15x, -6x + 8y = 15y.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow let's ask Sage to compute with real numbers. We can do this by representing one of the coefficients as a decimal. For instance, the same linear system can be represented as\n\\[x+0.5y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+ \\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+ \\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] Most computers do arithmetic using either 32 or 64 bits. To magnify the problem so that we can see it better, we will ask Sage to do arithmetic using only 10 bits as follows.\n``` R=RealNumber RealNumber=RealField(10)\n#ent\nWhat does Sage give for the solution now? Compare this to the exact solution that you found previously.\n2. Some types of linear systems are particularly sensitive to errors resulting from computers' approximate arithmetic. For instance, suppose we are interested in the linear system \\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2\\] Find the solution to this linear system.\nSuppose now that the computer has accumulated some error in one of the entries of this system so that it incorrectly stores the system as\n\\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2.001\\]\nFind the solution to this linear system.\nNotice how a small error in one of the entries in the linear system leads to a solution that has a dramatically large error. Fortunately, this is an issue that has been well studied, and there are techniques that mitigate this type of behavior.\n## Chapter 1 Systems of Equations\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNotice that each term on the left is the product of a constant and the first power of an unknown. In the future, we will want to consider equations having many more unknowns, which we will sometimes denote as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\). This leads to the following definition:\n**Definition 1.1.7**: A linear equation in the unknowns \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) may be written in the form\n\\[a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}x_{n}=b,\\]\nwhere \\(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) are real numbers known as _coefficients_. We also say that \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) are the _variables_ in the equation.\nBy a **system of linear equations** or a **linear system**, we mean a set of linear equations written in a common set of unknowns.\nFor instance,\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}2x_{1}+&1.2x_{2}-4x_{3}=3.7\\\\ -0.1x_{1}&&+&x_{3}=&2\\\\ x_{1}+&x_{2}-&x_{3}=1.4\\end{array}\\]\nis an example of a linear system.\n**Definition 1.1.8**: A **solution** to a linear system is simply a set of numbers \\(x_{1}=s_{1},x_{2}=s_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}=s_{n}\\) that satisfy all the equations in the system.\nFor instance, we earlier considered the linear system\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}-x+y=&1\\\\ -2x+y=-1.\\end{array}\\]\nTo check that \\((x,y)=(2,3)\\) is a solution, we verify that the following equations are true.\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}-2+3=&1\\\\ -2(2)+3=-1.\\end{array}\\]\n**Definition 1.1.9**: We call the set of all solutions the **solution space** of the linear system.\n**Activity 1.1.3**: **Linear equations and their solutions..**\n* Which of the following equations are linear?

We find that\n\\[A-(-1)I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich says that every two-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) satisfies \\((A-(-1)I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Therefore, every vector is an eigenvector and so \\(E_{-1}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). This eigenspace is two-dimensional.\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nThis leads to \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\).

These properties follow from the polynomial coefficient property above, and can also be directly shown. As an example, let us show that \\(a*b=b*a\\). Suppose \\(p\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(a\\), and \\(q\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(b\\). The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients. The coefficients of \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are \\(a*b\\) and the coefficients of \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are \\(b*a\\).

We call a basis orthogonal if the basis vectors are orthogonal to one another. However, a matrix is orthogonal if the columns are orthogonal to one another and have unit length. It pays to keep this in mind when reading statements about orthogonal bases and orthogonal matrices. In the meantime, we record the following proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.23**_An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is invertible and its inverse \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\)._\n#### Summary\nThis section introduced orthogonal sets and the projection formula that allows us to project vectors orthogonally onto a subspace.\n* Given an orthogonal set \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_{n}\\) that spans an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector in \\(W\\) closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and may be written as \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{1}}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{1}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{1}+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{2}}{\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{2}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\\mathbf{w}_{n} \\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{n}.\\]\n* If \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(W\\) and \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\), then the matrix \\(P=QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\).\n* If the columns of \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal basis for an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), then \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\).\n* An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is a square matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis. In this case, \\(QQ^{T}=Q^{T}Q=I\\) so that \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n_where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\).

If \\(Q\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) form an orthonormal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then\n* \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix, because this product computes the dot products between the columns of \\(Q\\).\n* \\(QQ^{T}\\) is the matrix the projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\).\nAs we've said before, matrix multiplication depends on the order in which we multiply the matrices, and we see this clearly here.\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\n\n",

Of course, one of the examples in the activity shows that there are exceptions to this simple rule, as seen in Figure 1.1.2. For instance, two equations in two unknowns may correspond to parallel lines so that the set of equations has no solutions. It may also happen that a set of three equations in two unknowns has a single solution. However, it seems safe to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of solutions will be.\nLet's also consider some examples of equations having three unknowns, which we call \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Just as solutions to linear equations in two unknowns formed straight lines, solutions to linear equations in three unknowns form planes.\nWhen we consider an equation in three unknowns graphically, we need to add a third coordinate axis, as shown in Figure 1.1.3.\nAs shown in Figure 1.1.4, a linear equation in two unknowns, such as \\(y=0\\), is a line while a linear equation in three unknowns, such as \\(z=0\\), is a plane.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1.

This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n6. What would happen if we were to compute \\(A_{4}\\)?\n7. What do you notice about the error \\(A-A_{k}\\) as \\(k\\) increases?\nIn this activity, the approximating matrix \\(A_{k}\\) has rank \\(k\\) because its singular value decomposition has \\(k\\) nonzero singular values. We then saw how the difference between \\(A\\) and the approximations \\(A_{k}\\) decreases as \\(k\\) increases, which means that the sequence \\(A_{k}\\) forms better approximations as \\(k\\) increases.\nAnother way to represent \\(A_{k}\\) is with a reduced singular value decomposition so that \\(A_{k}=U_{k}\\Sigma_{k}V_{k}^{T}\\) where\n\\[U_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{u}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\\Sigma_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{k}\\end{bmatrix},\\quad V_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1 }&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nNotice that the rank \\(1\\) matrix \\(A_{1}\\) then has the form \\(A_{1}=\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}= \\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\) and that we can similarly write:\n\\[A\\approx A_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\]\n\\[A\\approx A_{2}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}\\] \\[A\\approx A_{3}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_ {2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}\\] \\[\\qquad\\vdots\\] \\[A=A_{r}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}+ \\ldots+\\sigma_{r}\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\mathbf{v}_{r}^{T}.\\]\nGiven two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the matrix \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)\\(\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\) is called the _outer product_ of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). (The dot product \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{u}^{T}\\mathbf{v}\\) is sometimes called the _inner product_.) An outer product will always be a rank 1 matrix so we see above how \\(A_{k}\\) is obtained by adding together \\(k\\) rank \\(1\\) matrices, each of which gets us one step closer to the original matrix \\(A\\).\n#### Principal component analysis\nIn Section 7.3, we explored principal component analysis as a technique to reduce the dimension of a dataset. In particular, we constructed the covariance matrix \\(C\\) from a demeaned data matrix and saw that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(C\\) tell us about the variance of the dataset in different directions. We referred to the eigenvectors of \\(C\\) as _principal components_ and found that projecting the data onto a subspace defined by the first few principal components frequently gave us a way to visualize the dataset. As we added more principal components, we retained more information about the original dataset. This feels similar to the rank \\(k\\) approximations we have just seen so let's explore the connection.\n\n\n",

Our definition of an invertible matrix requires that \\(A\\) be a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. Let's examine what happens when \\(A\\) is not square.

If we know there is a solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\(B\\) to find \\(\\mathbf{x}=B\\mathbf{b}\\). Suppose you know there is a solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-1\\\\ -3\\\\ 6\\end{array}\\right]\\).

Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane.

These are plotted in figure 11.2.

As a consequence, we can write the vector above as \\(\\beta\\gamma a\\), since it does not matter whether we interpret this as \\(\\beta(\\gamma a)\\) or \\((\\beta\\gamma)a\\).\nThe associative property holds also when we denote scalar-vector multiplication with the scalar on the right. For example, we have \\(\\beta(\\gamma a)=(\\beta a)\\gamma\\), and consequently we can write both as \\(\\beta a\\gamma\\). As a convention, however, this vector is normally written as \\(\\beta\\gamma a\\) or as \\((\\beta\\gamma)a\\).\nIf \\(a\\) is a vector and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, then\n\\[(\\beta+\\gamma)a=\\beta a+\\gamma a.\\]\n(This is the left-distributive property of scalar-vector multiplication.) Scalar multiplication, like ordinary multiplication, has higher precedence in equations than vector addition, so the right-hand side here, \\(\\beta a+\\gamma a\\), means \\((\\beta a)+(\\gamma a)\\). It is useful to identify the symbols appearing in this formula above. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right denotes vector addition. When scalar multiplication is written with the scalar on the right, we have the right-distributive property:\n\\[a(\\beta+\\gamma)=a\\beta+a\\gamma.\\]\nScalar-vector multiplication also satisfies another version of the right-distributive property:\n\\[\\beta(a+b)=\\beta a+\\beta b\\]\nfor any scalar \\(\\beta\\) and any \\(n\\)-vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this equation, both of the \\(+\\) symbols refer to the addition of \\(n\\)-vectors.\nExamples.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nScalar multiplication of matrices is defined in a similar way as for vectors, and is done by multiplying every element of the matrix by the scalar. For example\n\\[(-2)\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&6\\\\ 9&3\\\\ 6&0\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-2&-12\\\\ -18&-6\\\\ -12&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nAs with scalar-vector multiplication, the scalar can also appear on the right. Note that \\(0\\,A=0\\) (where the left-hand zero is the scalar zero, and the right-hand \\(0\\) is the zero matrix).\nSeveral useful properties of scalar multiplication follow directly from the definition. For example, \\((\\beta A)^{T}=\\beta(A^{T})\\) for a scalar \\(\\beta\\) and a matrix \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) is a matrix and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, then\n\\[(\\beta+\\gamma)A=\\beta A+\\gamma A,\\qquad(\\beta\\gamma)A=\\beta(\\gamma A).\\]\nIt is useful to identify the symbols appearing in these two equations. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left of the left-hand equation is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right of the left-hand equation denotes matrix addition. On the left side of the right-hand equation we see scalar-scalar multiplication (\\(\\alpha\\beta\\)) and scalar-matrix multiplication; on the right we see two cases of scalar-matrix multiplication.\nFinally, we mention that scalar-matrix multiplication has higher precedence than matrix addition, which means that we should carry out multiplication before addition (when there are no parentheses to fix the order). So the right-hand side of the left equation above is to be interpreted as \\((\\beta A)+(\\gamma A)\\).\n#### Matrix norm\n\n\n",

We first discuss this for a lower triangular matrix. Let \\(L\\) be \\(n\\times n\\) and lower triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. We show that the columns are linearly independent, _i.e._, \\(Lx=0\\) is only possible if \\(x=0\\). Expanding the matrix-vector product, we can write \\(Lx=0\\) as\n\\[L_{11}x_{1} = 0\\] \\[L_{21}x_{1}+L_{22}x_{2} = 0\\] \\[L_{31}x_{1}+L_{32}x_{2}+L_{33}x_{3} = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[L_{n1}x_{1}+L_{n2}x_{2}+\\cdots+L_{n,n-1}x_{n-1}+L_{nn}x_{n} = 0.\\]\nSince \\(L_{11}\\neq 0\\), the first equation implies \\(x_{1}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=0\\), the second equation reduces to \\(L_{22}x_{2}=0\\). Since \\(L_{22}\\neq 0\\), we conclude that \\(x_{2}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=x_{2}=0\\), the third equation now reduces to \\(L_{33}x_{3}=0\\), and since \\(L_{33}\\) is assumed to be nonzero, we have \\(x_{3}=0\\). Continuing this argument, we find that all entries of \\(x\\) are zero, and this shows that the columns of \\(L\\) are linearly independent. It follows that \\(L\\) is invertible.\nA similar argument can be followed to show that an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. One can also simply note that if \\(R\\) is upper triangular, then \\(L=R^{T}\\) is lower triangular with the same diagonal, and use the formula \\((L^{T})^{-1}=(L^{-1})^{T}\\) for the inverse of the transpose.\nInverse via QR factorization.The QR factorization gives a simple expression for the inverse of an invertible matrix. If \\(A\\) is square and invertible, its columns are linearly independent, so it has a QR factorization \\(A=QR\\). The matrix \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. Hence \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are invertible, and the formula for the inverse product gives\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\n\n\n",

The column space \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) contains all the vectors \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) for which the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent. The null space \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is the solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), which reflects on the uniqueness of solutions to this and other equations.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\).

In this case our goal is to choose a number \\(x\\) that is simultaneously close to all the numbers \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{k}\\). Let \\(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k}\\) be positive weights, and \\(\\hat{x}\\) the minimizer of the weighted objective (15.1). Show that \\(\\hat{x}\\) is a weighted average (or convex combination; see page 15.1) of the numbers \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{k}\\), _i.e._, it has the form\n\\[x=w_{1}b_{1}+\\cdots+w_{k}b_{k},\\]\nwhere \\(w_{i}\\) are nonnegative and sum to one. Give an explicit formula for the combination weights \\(w_{i}\\) in terms of the multi-objective least squares weights \\(\\lambda_{i}\\).\nConsider the regularized data fitting problem (15.7). Recall that the elements in the first column of \\(A\\) are one. Let \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) be the solution of (15.7), _i.e._, the minimizer of\n\\[\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{2}+\\lambda(\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\theta_{p}^{2}),\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**19.3**: _Boolean least squares._ The _Boolean least squares problem_ is a special case of the constrained nonlinear least squares problem (19.1), with the form\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&x_{i}^{2}=1,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n,\\end{array}\\]\nwhere the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is the variable to be chosen, and the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) and the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\) are the (given) problem data. The constraints require that each entry of \\(x\\) is either \\(-1\\) or \\(+1\\), _i.e._, \\(x\\) is a Boolean vector. Since each entry can take one of two values, there are \\(2^{n}\\) feasible values for the vector \\(x\\). The Boolean least squares problem arises in many applications.\nOne simple method for solving the Boolean least squares problem, sometimes called the _brute force method_, is to evaluate the objective function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) for each of the \\(2^{n}\\) possible values, and choose one that has the least value. This method is not practical for \\(n\\) larger than 30 or so. There are many heuristic methods that are much faster to carry out than the brute force method, and approximately solve it, _i.e._, find an \\(x\\) for which the objective is small, if not the smallest possible value over all \\(2^{n}\\) feasible values of \\(x\\). One such heuristic is the augmented Lagrangian algorithm 19.2.\n\n\n",

For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\n\n\n",

If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\n\n\n",

More specifically, any matrix \\(A\\) defines a function\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|A\\mathbf{x}|,\\]\nwhich measures the length of \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\). For example, the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-2\\end{bmatrix}\\) gives the function \\(l_{D}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{9x_{1}^{2}+4x_{2}^{2}}\\). The presence of the square root means that this function is not a quadratic form. We can, however, define the singular values and vectors by looking for the maximum and minimum of this function \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{u})\\) among all unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\).\nWhile \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is not itself a quadratic form, it becomes one if we square it:\n\\[(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x}))^{2}=|A\\mathbf{x}|^{2}=(A\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})= \\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A^{T}A\\mathbf{x})=q_{A^{T}A}(\\mathbf{x}).\\]\nWe call \\(G=A^{T}A\\), the _Gram matrix_ associated to \\(A\\) and note that\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}.\\]\nThis is important in the next activity, which introduces singular values and singular vectors.\n**Activity 7.4.2**.: The following interactive figure will help us explore singular values and vectors geometrically before we begin a more algebraic approach.\nThere is an interactive diagram, available at gvsu.edu/s/0VE, that accompanies this activity.\n**Figure 7.4.1** Singular values, right singular vectors and left singular vectors\nSelect the matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\ -2&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\).

This is illustrated in figure 11.1, which shows the two cubic polynomials that interpolate the two sets of points shown as filled circles and squares, respectively.\nThe columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are interesting: They give the coefficients of a polynomial that evaluates to 0 at three of the points, and 1 at the other\nfirst column of \\(A^{-1}\\), which is \\(A^{-1}e_{1}\\), gives the coefficients of the polynomial that has value 1 at \\(-1.1\\), and value 0 at \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, and 0.8.

Give an example of such a system by writing its augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form. 2. Write just the coefficient matrix for the example you gave in the previous part. What can you say about the pivot positions in the coefficient matrix? Explain why your observation must hold for any homogeneous system having a unique solution. 3. If a homogeneous system of equations has a unique solution, what can you say about the number of equations compared to the number of variables?\nIn a previous math class, you have probably seen the fact that, if we are given two points in the plane, then there is a unique line passing through both of them. In this problem, we will begin with the four points on the left below and ask to find a polynomial that passes through these four points as shown on the right.\nA degree three polynomial can be written as\n\\[p(x)=a+bx+cx^{2}+dx^{3}\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are coefficients that we would like to determine. Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point \\((3,1)\\), we should require that\n\\[p(3)=a+3b+9c+27d=1.\\]\nIn this way, we obtain a linear equation for the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).\n1.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many triangles are there whose sides are all integers and whose maximum side length equals 11?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nAs an example, consider the 4-vectors\n\\[u=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.8\\\\ 2.0\\\\ -3.7\\\\ 4.7\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad v=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.6\\\\ 2.1\\\\ 1.9\\\\ -1.4\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad w=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2.0\\\\ 1.9\\\\ -4.0\\\\ 4.6\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe distances between pairs of them are\n\\[\\|u-v\\|=8.368,\\qquad\\|u-w\\|=0.387,\\qquad\\|v-w\\|=8.533,\\]\nso we can say that \\(u\\) is much nearer (or closer) to \\(w\\) than it is to \\(v\\). We can also say that \\(w\\) is much nearer to \\(u\\) than it is to \\(v\\).\nTriangle inequality.We can now explain where the triangle inequality gets its name. Consider a triangle in two or three dimensions, whose vertices have coordinates \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The lengths of the sides are the distances between the vertices,\n\\[\\mathbf{dist}(a,b)=\\|a-b\\|,\\qquad\\mathbf{dist}(b,c)=\\|b-c\\|,\\qquad\\mathbf{dist }(a,c)=\\|a-c\\|.\\]\nGeometric intuition tells us that the length of any side of a triangle cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. For example, we have\n\\[\\|a-c\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\] (3.3)\nThis follows from the triangle inequality, since\n\\[\\|a-c\\|=\\|(a-b)+(b-c)\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\]\nThis is illustrated in figure 3.2.\nFigure 3.2: Triangle inequality.\n#### Examples.\n* _Feature distance._ If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent vectors of \\(n\\) features of two objects, the quantity \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) is called the _feature distance_, and gives a measure of how different the objects are (in terms of their feature values). Suppose for example the feature vectors are associated with patients in a hospital, with entries such as weight, age, presence of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and the results of tests. We can use feature vector distance to say that one patient case is near another one (at least in terms of their feature vectors).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nThis leads to \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\). In the same way, we find that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\) so that the matrix \\(A\\) is\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\n\n",

This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).

In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself.
