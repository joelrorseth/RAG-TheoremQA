The number of ways we can do this is\n\\[\\binom{11}{4,1,2,4}=\\frac{11!}{4!1!2!4!}=34650.\\]\nIn the next remark, we compare anagrams with ordered set partitions. We will use this to prove Theorem 4.5.7.\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n2. This is a set partition since the blocks of students are not assigned to different days of the week. There are \\(4!\\) ways to order the \\(4\\) blocks. So we divide the answer to part (1) by \\(4!\\).\nAs a final application, we see what happens if we take a power of a sum of more than two variables. The answer to this question is why the expression \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{n}}\\) is often called a _multinomial coefficient_.\n**Example 4.6.8**.: The third power of \\(x+y+z\\) is\n\\[(x+y+z)^{3}=x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+3x^{2}y+3xy^{2}+3x^{2}z+3xz^{2}+3y^{2}z+3yz^{2}+ 6xyz.\\]\nThe coefficients of this expansion are all examples of multinomial coefficients.\nHere is the **Multinomial Theorem**, which directly generalizes the Binomial Theorem from Theorem 4.2.2.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses such that they are balanced?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nProof.: It is important to note that Assigner does not need to know the value \\(h\\) in advance. For example, Builder may have in mind that ultimately the value of \\(h\\) will be \\(300\\), but this information does not impact Assigner's strategy.\nWhen the new point \\(x_{n}\\) enters \\(P\\), Assigner computes the values \\(r\\) and \\(s\\), where \\(r\\) is the largest integer for which there exists a chain \\(C\\) of \\(r\\) points in \\(\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}\\) having \\(x_{n}\\) as its least element. Also, \\(s\\) is the largest integer for which there exists a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points in \\(\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}\\) having \\(x_{n}\\) as its largest element. Assigner then places \\(x\\) in a set \\(A(r,s)\\), claiming that any two points in this set are incomparable. To see that this claim is valid, consider the first moment where Builder has presented a new point \\(x\\), Assigner places \\(x\\) in \\(A(r,s)\\) and there is already a point \\(y\\) in \\(A(r,s)\\) for which \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are comparable.\nWhen \\(y\\) was presented, there was at that moment in time a chain \\(C^{\\prime}\\) of \\(r\\) points having \\(y\\) as its least element. Also, there was a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points having \\(y\\) as its greatest element.\nNow suppose that \\(y>x\\) in \\(P\\). Then we can add \\(x\\) to \\(C^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(r+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its least element. This would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned in \\(A(r,s)\\). Similarly, if \\(y<x\\) in \\(P\\), then we may add \\(x\\) to \\(D^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(s+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its greatest element. Again, this would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned to \\(A(r,s)\\).\nSo Assigner has indeed devised a good strategy for partitioning \\(P\\) into antichains, but how many antichains has she used? This is just asking how many ordered pairs \\((i,j)\\) of positive integers are there subject to the restriction that \\(i+j-1\\leq h\\). And we learned how to solve this kind of question in Chapter 2. The answer of course is \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\).\nThe strategy for Assigner is so simple and natural, it might be the case that a more complex strategy would yield a more efficient partitioning. Not so.\n**Theorem 16.5** (Szemeredi).: _For every \\(h\\geq 1\\), there is a strategy \\(S_{h}\\) for builder that will enable him to build a poset \\(P\\) of height \\(h\\) so that assigner is forced to (1) use at least \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\) antichains in partitioning \\(P\\), and (2) use at least \\(h\\) different antichains on the set of maximal elements._\nProof.: Strategy \\(S_{1}\\) is just to present a single point. Now suppose that the theorem holds for some integer \\(h\\geq 1\\). We show how strategy \\(S_{h+1}\\) proceeds.\nFirst Builder follows strategy \\(S_{h}\\) to form a poset \\(P_{1}\\). Then he follows it a second time for form a poset \\(P_{2}\\), with all points of \\(P_{1}\\) incomparable to all points in \\(P_{2}\\). Now we consider two cases. Suppose first that Assigner has used \\(h+1\\) or more antichains on the set of maximal elements of \\(P_{1}\\cup P_{2}\\). In this case, he follows strategy \\(S_{h}\\) a third time to build a poset \\(P_{3}\\) with all points of \\(P_{3}\\) less than all maximal elements of \\(P_{1}\\cup P_{2}\\) and incomparable with all other points.\n\n\n",

Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

By the inductive assumption we can color what remains. Since \\(v\\) has at most \\(d\\) neighbors, there is at least one free color out of the \\((d+1)\\)-colors we can use to color \\(v\\) compatibly. Hence we are done by induction.\nBelow is a picture in the case when \\(d=3\\).\n_Aside._ Furthermore, a graph in which every vertex has degree at most \\(d\\) is \\(d\\)-colorable unless\n* \\(d=2\\) and some connected component is an odd cycle, or\n* \\(d>2\\) and some connected component is \\(K_{d+1}\\).\nThe proof of this aside is very hard!\n**Exercise.** Show the following graph is not \\(3\\)-colorable.\n**Remark 12.4.4**.: Sadly there is no \\(K_{4}\\) in this graph, because then we'd be done immediately.\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction that this graph were \\(3\\)-colorable. Without loss of generality let vertex \\(1\\) be Red. Then vertices \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) are Blue and Green or Green and Blue, which implies \\(6\\) is Red. Also vertices \\(4\\) and \\(5\\) are Blue and Green or Green and Blue, which implies \\(7\\) is Red. This is a contradiction since \\(6\\) and \\(7\\) are adjacent! Hence this graph is not \\(3\\)-colorable.\n**Exercise.** Show the following graph is not \\(3\\)-colorable.\nIn the following solution, we will call the inner vertex \\(P\\) the _central vertex_, and the other vertices are in five pairs of _twins_: \\(A_{1}\\) and \\(A_{2}\\) are twins, \\(B_{1}\\) and \\(B_{2}\\) are twins, and so on. In its pair, \\(A_{1}\\) is called the _outer twin_ and \\(A_{2}\\) is called the _inner twin_ (and similarly for all other twin pairs).\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction this graph were 3-colorable. Without loss of generality let the central vertex be Red. So all 5 inner vertices are Blue or Green. A way of coloring the vertices that agrees with this choice is shown below (but naturally is not a 3-coloring - we will just pretend that it is a valid coloring as an illustration).\nWe will show that, if this coloring is a valid 3-coloring, then we can use it to produce a valid 2-coloring of the outer 5-cycle (but _not_ of the entire graph) as follows: if any outer twin is colored Red, replace Red with the color of its inner twin (Blue or Green). Then in this coloring of the outer cycle with Blue and Green, if an outer twin \\(v\\) is changed from Red to Blue (for example), then both of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins must be Green. Indeed, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been Blue since they are each connected to \\(v\\)'s inner twin which is Blue. Also, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been changed from Red (to any other color) since \\(v\\) was originally Red.\nBut this is a contradiction--no odd cycle can be 2-colored. Hence the original graph must not be 3-colorable.\n### Exercises\n1.

Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n\n\n",

A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\n\n",

Each table must have at least 1 person seated.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\n\n",

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

Comparing this with Table 15.2 shows that the generating function is right on.\nBy now the pattern is becoming apparent. If we substitute \\(w^{i}+g^{i}\\) for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index for each \\(i\\), we then keep track of how many vertices are colored white and how many are colored gold. The simplification of the cycle index in this case is then a generating function in which the coefficient on \\(g^{s}w^{t}\\) is the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of the square with \\(s\\) vertices colored gold and \\(t\\) vertices colored white. Doing this and simplifying gives\n\\[P_{D_{8}}(w+g,w^{2}+g^{2},w^{3}+g^{3},w^{4}+g^{4})=g^{4}+g^{3}w+2g^{2}w^{2}+gw ^{3}+w^{4}.\\]\nFrom this we find one coloring with all vertices gold, one coloring with all vertices white, one coloring with three gold vertices and one white vertex, one coloring with one gold vertex and three white vertices, and two colorings with two vertices of each color.\nAs with the other results we've discovered in this chapter, this property of the cycle index holds up beyond the case of coloring the vertices of the square with two colors. The full version is Polya's enumeration theorem:\n**Theorem 15.11** (Polya's Enumeration Theorem).: _Let \\(S\\) be a set with \\(|S|=r\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) the set of colorings of \\(S\\) using the colors \\(c_{1},\\ldots,c_{m}\\). If a permutation group \\(G\\) acts on \\(S\\) to induce an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then_\n\\[P_{G}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i},\\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i}^{2},\\ldots,\\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_ {i}^{r}\\right)\\]\n_is the generating function for the number of nonequivalent colorings of \\(S\\) in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\)._\nIf we return to coloring the vertices of the square but now allow the color blue as well, we find\n\\[P_{D_{8}}(w+g+b,w^{2}+g^{2}+b^{2},w^{3}+g^{3}+b^{3},w^{4}+g^{4}+b^{4})=b^{4}+b ^{3}g+2b^{2}g^{2}\\]\n\\[+bg^{3}+g^{4}+b^{3}w+2b^{2}gw+2bg^{2}w+g^{3}w+2b^{2}w^{2}+2bgw^{2}+2g^{2 }w^{2}\\] \\[+bw^{3}+gw^{3}+w^{4}.\\]\nFrom this generating function, we can readily determine the number of nonequivalent colorings with two blue vertices, one gold vertex, and one white vertex to be 2. Because the generating function of Polya's Enumeration Theorem records the number of nonequivalent patterns, it is sometimes called the **pattern inventory**.\nWhat if we were interested in making necklaces with 500 (very small) beads colored white, gold, and blue? This would be equivalent to coloring the vertices of a regular 500-gon, and the dihedral group \\(D_{1000}\\) would give the appropriate transformations. With a computer algebra system1 such as _Mathematica(r)_, it is possible to quickly produce the pattern inventory for such a problem. In doing so, we find that there are\nFootnote 1: With some more experience in group theory, it is possible to give a general formula for the cycle index of the dihedral group \\(D_{2n}\\), so the computer algebra system is a nice tool, but not required.\n\\[3636029179586993684238526707954331911802338502600162304034603583\\] \\[2580600191583895484198508262979388783308179702534404046627287796\\] \\[4304252714992703135653472347417085467453334179308247819807028526\\] \\[92187253642441292279756575936040804567103229\\approx 3.6\\times 10^{ 235}\\]\npossible necklaces.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many different 6-letter arrangements can be made from the letters in the word BANANA?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\\[\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\mid\\bullet.\\]\nThe first stone indicates that there is one apple, then the next two stones indicates that there are two bananas, and so on. There are no stones between the last two sticks because there are no oranges in the bag.\nEach bag can be written using six stones and four sticks. There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\n\n",

To do this, we define a _set partition_, which is a a helpful way to organize sets.\n**Definition 2.9.1**.: Let \\(A\\) be a finite set. A non-empty subset \\(B\\) of \\(A\\) is called a **block**. A **set partition** of a finite set \\(A\\) is a set of blocks \\(\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) of \\(A\\) such that:\n1. the blocks are disjoint, that is, \\(B_{i}\\cap B_{j}=\\emptyset\\) for all \\(i\\neq j\\); and\n2. the union of the blocks is \\(A\\), that is \\(B_{1}\\cup B_{2}\\cup\\cdots\\cup B_{k}=A\\).\n**Example 2.9.2**.: The following is a set partition of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}\\):\n\\[\\{\\{1,3,4\\},\\{2,6\\},\\{5,7\\}\\}.\\]\nThe division principle arises when we split a set into blocks of equal sizes. It can be stated as follows.\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n\n\n",

Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n\n\n",

The number of lotto tickets is the number of ways to choose 5 numbers out of 90. This equals\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

Look up the statement of the Well-Ordering Principle. Explain how it is similar to and different from induction. 2. Prove the Well-Ordering principle using only strong induction and the axiom that 0 is smaller than every positive integer, as follows. 1. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the statement that any subset of the natural numbers containing \\(n\\) has a least element.\n2. Prove \\(P(0)\\). 3. Prove that if \\(P(0),P(1),\\ldots,P(n)\\) are all true, then \\(P(n+1)\\) is true.\n8. Let \\(p\\) be a prime.

Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9. In this problem, we will prove Fermat's Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument. 1. Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\n\n",

To celebrate, the seven students decide to get a large sundae in a bowl, filled with many different scoops of ice cream. There are 10 flavors of ice cream and a large sundae has 15 scoops. Since it is a hot day in Colorado, all of the scoops will melt together, so the order of the scoops does not matter. Each flavor can be used for as many of the 15 scoops as they want. How many different sundaes can student \\(c\\) order?\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.4. To solve problems of this type, we define a _multiset_; intuitively, this is a set whose elements do not need to be different.\n**Example 3.5.1**.: The multiset \\(\\{\\text{apple},\\text{apple},\\text{orange},\\text{pear},\\text{pear}\\}\\) denotes a collection of two identical apples, one orange, and two identical pears.\n**Definition 3.5.2**.: A **multiset** is a set, together with a positive integer multiplicity assigned to each element. Equivalently, it is a set \\(S\\), together with a function \\(f:S\\to\\mathbb{N}-\\{0\\}\\).\nA multiset can be written down in several ways:\n* by listing an element of the set \\(m\\) times if it has multiplicity \\(m\\);\n* by writing the multiplicity as a superscript on the element; (This method can sometimes lead to confusion.)\n* by writing down the function \\(f\\).\n**Example 3.5.3**.: Here are several ways to write the multiset with three 4's, one 5, and two 6's:\n* \\(\\{4,4,4,5,6,6\\}\\) or \\(\\{4,5,4,6,4,6\\}\\) (the order does not matter).\n* \\(\\{4^{\\times 3},5^{\\times 1},6^{\\times 2}\\}\\) Warning! The \\(4^{\\times 3}\\) written here does not mean 4 raised to the power \\(\\times 3\\). It means that 4 occurs 3 times in the multiset.\n* The function \\(f:\\{4,5,6\\}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(f(4)=3\\), \\(f(5)=1\\), and \\(f(6)=2\\).\n**Notation 3.5.4**.: The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements are chosen from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is sometimes written \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). We pronounce this symbol \"\\(n\\) multichoose \\(k\\)\" or \"\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\) with repeats\".\n#### Counting multisets with sticks and stones\nTo count the number of multisets of a certain kind, we use what we call the \"sticks and stones\" method. (In other sources, this is sometimes called the \"stars and bars\" method.) We illustrate this method first with an example.\n**Example 3.5.5**.: Suppose we have an unlimited supply of 5 kinds of fruit: apples, bananas, mangoes, oranges, and pears. Let's write them as A, B, M, O, and P for short. How many ways can we make a bag of 6 fruits?\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nWhat is the smallest number of vertices in a graph that guarantees the existence of a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 2?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nProof.: We again start with \\(\\mathbf{G}_{3}\\) as the cycle \\(\\mathbf{C}_{5}\\). As before we assume that we have constructed for some \\(t\\geq 3\\) a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t})=2\\) and \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t})=t\\). Again, label the vertices of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n_{t}}\\). To construct \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\), we now start with an independent set \\(I\\), but now \\(I\\) has only \\(n_{t}\\) points, which we label as \\(y_{1},y_{2},\\ldots,y_{n_{t}}\\). We then add a copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with \\(y_{i}\\) adjacent to \\(x_{j}\\) if and only if \\(x_{i}\\) is adjacent to \\(x_{j}\\). Finally, attach a new vertex \\(z\\) adjacent to all vertices in \\(I\\).\nClearly, \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=2\\). Also, \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})\\geq t\\), since it contains \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) as a subgraph. Furthermore, \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})\\leq t+1\\), since we can color \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with colors from \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,t\\}\\), use color \\(t+1\\) on the independent set \\(I\\), and then assign color \\(1\\) to the new vertex \\(z\\). We claim that in fact \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t+1\\). Suppose not. Then we must have \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t\\). Let \\(\\phi\\) be a proper\ncoloring of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\). Without loss of generality, \\(\\phi\\) uses the colors in \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,t\\}\\) and \\(\\phi\\) assigns color \\(t\\) to \\(z\\). Then consider the nonempty set \\(S\\) of vertices in the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) to which \\(\\phi\\) assigns color \\(t\\). For each \\(x_{i}\\) in \\(S\\), change the color on \\(x_{i}\\) so that it matches the color assigned to \\(y_{i}\\) by \\(\\phi\\), which cannot be \\(t\\), as \\(z\\) is colored \\(t\\). What results is a proper coloring of the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with only \\(t-1\\) colors since \\(x_{i}\\) and \\(y_{i}\\) are adjacent to the same vertices of the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\). The contradiction shows that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t+1\\), as claimed.\nSince a 3-clique looks like a triangle, Proposition 5.25 is often stated as \"There exist triangle-free graphs with large chromatic number.\" As an illustration of the construction in the proof of Mycielski, we again refer to Figure 5.19. The graph shown is \\(\\mathbf{G}_{4}\\). We will return to the topic of graphs with large chromatic number in Section 11.6 where we show that are there graphs with large chromatic number which lack not only cliques of more than two vertices but also _cycles_ of fewer than \\(g\\) vertices for _any_ value of \\(g\\). In other words, there is a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) with \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})=10^{6}\\) but no cycle with fewer than \\(10^{10}\\) vertices!\n#### Can We Determine Chromatic Number?\nSuppose you are given a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\). It's starting to look like it is not easy to find an algorithm that answers the question \"Is \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})\\leq t\\)?\" It's easy to verify a certificate (a proper coloring using at most \\(t\\) colors), but how could you even find a proper coloring, not to mention one with the fewest number of colors? Similarly for the question \"Is \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\geq k\\)?\", it is easy to verify a certificate. However, finding a maximum clique appears to be a very hard problem. Of course, since the gap between \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})\\) and \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\) can be arbitrarily large, being able to find one value would not (generally) help in finding the value of the other. No polynomial-time algorithm is known for either of these problems, and many believe that no such algorithm exists. In this subsection, we look at one approach to finding chromatic number and see a case where it does work efficiently.\n\n\n",

Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n\n\n",

A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\n\n",

They read the first problem that they were assigned.\nFootnote 1: To protect their privacy, students are identified by their first initial in this book.\n**Question 2.1.1**.: How many ways are there to choose 6 numbers from the set \\(\\{1,\\ldots,20\\}\\) so that at least four of them are odd?\nStudent \\(d\\) watched as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) each worked on the problem for several minutes, using paper, calculators, and tablets. Finally, student \\(d\\) said 'Hey, I don't know how to get started with this.'\n**Student \\(a\\)**: My thought is there are 10 odd numbers between 1 and 20. So there are 10 choices for the first odd number, 9 choices for the second, 8 choices for the third, and 7 choices for the fourth. The last two numbers can be odd or even and there are 16 numbers left. So that gives 16 choices for the fifth and 15 choices for the sixth. So the answer is\n\\[10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 16\\cdot 15=1,209,600.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: You're forgetting that the order doesn't matter. So first we need to choose four numbers out of the 10 odd numbers, then we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 16 numbers. So the answer is\n\\[\\binom{10}{4}\\cdot\\binom{16}{2}=\\frac{10!}{4!6!}\\cdot\\frac{16!}{2!14!}=25,200.\\]\n**Student \\(c\\)**: I have a different way of doing it. There are \\(\\binom{20}{6}\\) ways to choose six integers out of the 20, but the probability that a number is odd is \\(1/2\\). So the answer is\n\\[\\binom{20}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{4}}=\\frac{20!}{6!14!}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{4}}=2422.5.\\]\nWait, that's not an integer....\n**Student \\(d\\)**: What if there are more than four odd numbers? Forget this, let's try the next question.\n**Question 2.1.2**.: In a game of poker, you are dealt five cards from a standard 52 card deck. How many ways can you be dealt a full house?\n**Student \\(c\\)**: I've never played cards. What is a full house?2\nFootnote 2: If you are not familiar with cards or poker, there is a lot of helpful information in Section 3.8.\n**Student \\(a\\)**: It's a triple of the same number together with a pair of a different number. Like 6 of hearts, 6 of clubs, and 6 of diamonds, together with 3 of hearts and 3 of spades. So I'm thinking for the first card, we have 52 choices; no matter what number it is, to get a triple we need to choose two more out of the three remaining cards of that number, and there are three ways to do that. Then there are 48 choices for the next card; no matter what number it is, to get a pair we need to choose one more out of the three remaining cards of that number, and there are three ways to do that. So the answer is:\n\\[52\\cdot 3\\cdot 48\\cdot 3=22464.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: That's over counting again because it doesn't matter which card is dealt first. Instead, let's choose two numbers out of 13, then choose three suits for the first number and then choose two suits for the second number. So the answer is:\n\n\n",

Four student houses, A, B, C, and D often order pizza. Their patterns of pizza ordering can be modeled as a graph. The graph contains seven vertices -- three vertices for the three pizza parlors, and four vertices for the four student houses. If a house ordered pizza from a particular parlor in the last month, then this support is modeled by an edge in the graph. (Later, we might also choose to weight the edge by the number of pizzas ordered from that parlor over the last month.)\nThis graph has a particular structure: there are no edges between two pizza parlors, since a pizza parlor never orders pizza from another parlor; similarly, there are no edges between two houses, since no house ever orders pizza from another house!\nMany problems in graph theory involve matching two different types of objects, like students with jobs, or pets with owners.\n**Definition 8.2.8**.: A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) is **bipartite** if \\(V\\) is the disjoint union of two sets \\(L\\) (left) and \\(R\\) (right) and every edge connects a vertex in \\(L\\) with a vertex in \\(R\\).\nIn other words, there are no edges between two vertices in \\(L\\) and no edges between two vertices in \\(R\\).\nFigure 8.6: Bipartite graph with three vertices on the left corresponding to pizza parlors, and four vertices on the right corresponding to houses.

There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n\n\n",

These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right.

If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n### Exercises\n1. _Counting Rocks!_ If 5 people pick up 11 rocks in total, show that someone picked up at least 3.\n2. _Counting Socks!_ If a drawer contains 16 black and 16 white socks, how many do you need to pick in order to have a matching pair?\n\n\n",

Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

The number of lotto tickets is the number of ways to choose 5 numbers out of 90. This equals\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

To properly distinguish one region from another, it is crucial to utilize a different color for territories sharing a common border. After making many maps for various royal affairs, you begin to question the coloring of your maps. How many colors are needed to color planar maps in a satisfactory way? The below map can be colored with four colors.\nColoring maps can be related to coloring planar graphs. Indeed, below we show how to turn this map into a planar graph, and how a valid coloring of this map translates into a vertex coloring of the corresponding planar graph. To form the graph, add a vertex for each region, and add an edge between two vertices if the corresponding regions are adjacent. A valid coloring of the map, with no adjacent regions of the same color, corresponds to a vertex coloring of the graph, meaning that no adjacent vertices have the same color.\nLet us explain why this map requires at least 4 colors, in order for adjacent regions to have different colors. Suppose for a contradiction 3 colors sufficed. Without loss of generality, color the region 'N' red, color the region 'C' blue, and color the region 'O' green. Then necessarily the region 'I' must be blue, as it is already adjacent to green and red regions, and we have only three colors at our disposal. And similarly, the region 'U' must now necessarily be green. There is now no valid color for region 'A', as it is already adjacent to regions labeled blue, red, and green. Hence at least 4 colors are needed to color this map!\nBelow is a smaller map that requires 4 colors so that adjacent regions are not of the same color. Indeed, the planar graph corresponding to this map is \\(K_{4}\\), the complete graph on four vertices, which requires at least 4 colors.\nAfter successfully coloring many large maps with only four colors, our cartographer begins to wonder if _all_ planar maps can be colored with four colors. This is true and is now called the four-color theorem; it states that any map drawn on the plane or the surface of a sphere can be colored using four colors in such a way that areas with a common boundary are not the same color.\n**Theorem 12.7.1** (Four color theorem).: _Every planar map can be colored with only 4 colors, so that adjacent regions (sharing a boundary of positive length) have different colors._\nThe history of the four color theorem is quite interesting. The question \"Can every planar map be 4-colored\" was first raised by Francis Guthrie in England in 1852. In 1879, Alfred Kempe published an incorrect proof, which for a decade was regarded as correct before the error was found! Indeed, in 1886 the problem of showing that any planar map can be 4-colored was posed to the students of Clifton College,\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time.

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners.

One very famous such object is called a _partition_. The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n#### Fun with infinite products\nIn the video above, it was shown informally that the generating function for the partition numbers \\(p(n)\\) has the infinite product formula:\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}p(n)x^{n}=\\frac{1}{(1-x)}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(1-x^{2})}\\cdot\\frac {1}{(1-x^{3})}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(1-x^{4})}\\cdots.\\]\nWe now explore infinite products of generating functions in more rigorous detail.\n**Definition 7.8.6**.: Let \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x),\\ldots\\) be an infinite collection of generating functions. We say that the infinite product\n\\[\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}F_{n}(x)=F_{1}(x)F_{2}(x)F_{3}(x)\\cdots\\]\n**converges to \\(G(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}b_{i}x^{i}\\)**, if the partial products\n\\[P_{m}(x)=\\prod_{n=0}^{m}F_{n}(x)=F_{1}(x)F_{2}(x)\\cdots F_{m}(x)\\]\nhave coefficients that eventually match those of \\(G(x)\\). This means that for all \\(i\\), there is some positive integer \\(N\\) such that if \\(m>N\\), the coefficient of \\(x^{i}\\) in \\(P_{m}(x)\\) equals \\(b_{i}\\).\nIf the product converges to \\(G(x)\\), we simply say that the infinite product is **equal** to \\(G(x)\\).\n**Question 7.8.7**.: Suppose \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x),\\ldots\\) are all equal to \\(1+x\\).\n1. Expand the first three partial products: \\[P_{1}(x)=F_{1}(x)=(1+x)=?\\] \\[P_{2}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)=(1+x)^{2}=?\\] \\[P_{3}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)=(1+x)^{3}=?\\]\n2. What is the coefficient of \\(x\\) in your answers to part 1? Find a pattern and determine the coefficient of \\(x\\) in \\(P_{m}(x)\\).\n3. Prove that the infinite product \\[F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdot F_{4}(x)\\cdots=(1+x)(1+x)(1+x)(1+x)\\cdots\\] does **not** converge to any generating function, because the pattern you found in part 2 does not converge.\n**Question 7.8.8**.: Define \\(F_{i}(x)=1+x^{2^{i-1}}\\) for all \\(i\\).\n1. Write out \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x)\\), and \\(F_{4}(x)\\).\n2. Expand the first four partial products * \\(P_{1}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\), * \\(P_{2}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\), * \\(P_{3}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\), * \\(P_{4}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdot F_{4}(x)\\).\n3. Find a pattern and use it to prove that the infinite product \\[F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdots=(1+x)(1+x^{2})(1+x^{4})(1+x^{8})(1 +x^{16})\\cdots\\] does converge, and explain what generating function it converges to.\nFor the next two questions, you may find it helpful to watch the explanation in this section's video for why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-x^{i}}=\\sum p(n)x^{n}\\).\n**Question 7.8.9**.: Recall the definition of \\(q(n)\\) in Definition 7.8.3. Explain why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}(1+x^{i})=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}q(n)x^{n}\\).\n**Question 7.8.10**.: Explain why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-x^{2i}}=\\sum E(n)x^{n}\\) where \\(E(n)\\) is the number of partitions of \\(n\\) that use only even parts.\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1. How many three-digit positive integers are even?\n2. _Counting Rocks!_ You have 6 distinct rocks and 2 identical buckets. How many different ways can you put 3 rocks in each bucket?\n3. In how many ways can you attach the letters of MATH in some order to a piece of string? (If you turn the string over so that the order of the letters is reversed, it is not considered a different possibility. So for instance, MATH and HTAM are considered the same ordering.)\n4. There are 10 people in a dance class. How many ways can they pair off into 5 pairs of dance partners? (Gender does not matter in making the pairings.)\n\n\n",

Note that \\(v=5\\) and \\(e=\\binom{5}{2}=10\\). By Euler's formula, then \\(v-e+f=2\\). So \\(5-10+f=2\\). This implies that \\(f=7\\).\nBy Lemma 11.3.1, \\(10=e\\geq\\frac{3f}{2}=\\frac{3.7}{2}=10.5\\). This is a contradiction, and hence \\(K_{5}\\) cannot be planar.\nSince \\(K_{5}\\) is not planar, any graph that contains \\(K_{5}\\) as a subgraph is not planar. One of the exercises is to show that \\(B_{3,3}\\) is not planar; because of this, any graph that contains \\(B_{3,3}\\) as a subgraph is not planar.\nThe following theorem says that the reason any graph is non-planar is because either \\(K_{5}\\) or \\(B_{3,3}\\) is hidden in the graph. In order to understand this theorem, we need to generalize the idea of subgraphs to a new concept of _minors_. (In some texts, this theorem is expressed using _subdivisions_ rather than minors.) We include this theorem just for your general knowledge -- we will often ask you to determine whether a graph is planar or not _without_ using Kuratowski's Theorem!\n**Definition 11.3.5**.: Given a graph \\(G\\), an _edge contraction_ is a way to make a new graph by removing an edge from \\(G\\) and merging the two vertices that were at its endpoints. A graph \\(H\\) is a _minor_ of \\(G\\) if \\(H\\) can be obtained from G by contracting some edges, deleting some edges, and deleting some isolated vertices.\nIn the graph below on the left, if we contract the red edge, then we obtain the graph below on the right.\n**Theorem 11.3.6** (Kuratowski's Theorem).: _A graph \\(G\\) is planar if and only if it does not contain \\(K_{5}\\) or \\(K_{3,3}\\) as a minor._\nFor example, the Petersen graph is not planar since it has \\(K_{5}\\) as a minor.\nIndeed, one can contract all five edges connecting the \"inner star\" to the \"outer pentagon\" to form a copy of \\(K_{5}\\).\n### Exercises\n1. What is the smallest number of crossings needed for a graph of \\(K_{5}\\) drawn in the plane? Illustrate this.\n2. Is it possible to find any set of nine edges from \\(K_{8}\\) such that if you remove those 9 edges then you obtain a (connected) planar graph? If so, draw it. If not, explain why not.\n3. If \\(G\\) is a bipartite graph which is a planar graph, prove that \\(e\\geq 2f\\).\n4. Prove that the complete bipartite graph \\(B_{3,3}\\) is not planar. You are not allowed to use Kuratowski's Theorem. (As a consequence, it is impossible to connect the above three houses on the left to the water, electricity and gas utilities on the right, without having some of the utility lines cross.)\n5. Draw the graph \\(B_{3,3}\\) in the plane with the smallest number of crossings possible.\n6. Show that the Petersen graph is not planar. (You are not allowed to use Kuratowski's Theorem.) Use the fact (which you don't need to prove) that there are no cycles of length \\(3\\) or \\(4\\) in the Petersen graph.\n7. Prove that a planar graph with \\(v\\) vertices (where \\(v\\geq 3\\)) has at most \\(3v-6\\) edges. This result says that a planar graph with a fixed number of vertices cannot have too many edges!\n\n\n",

Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n### Exercises\n1. You have 7 different rolls of wrapping paper and 4 identical teddy bears.

The players mark the squares of the grid with the symbols X and O. This exercise uses Polya's enumeration theorem to investigate the number of different tic-tac-toe boards. (The analysis of _games_ is more complex, since it requires attention to the order the squares are marked and stopping when one player has won the game.)\n* Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the \\(9\\times 9\\) grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group \\(D_{8}\\) that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in Figure 15.16. For example, the effect of the transformation \\(r_{1}\\), which rotates the board \\(90^{\\circ}\\) clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as (13971)(2684)(5). Write each of the eight elements of \\(D_{8}\\) as permutations of the nine squares of a tic-tac-toe board.\n* Find the cycle index of \\(D_{8}\\) in terms of these permutations.\n* Make an appropriate substitution for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index to find a generating function \\(t(X,O)\\) in which the coefficient on \\(X^{i}O^{j}\\) is the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards having \\(i\\) squares filled by symbol X and \\(j\\) squares filled by symbol O. (Notice that some squares might be blank!)\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards are there?\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards have three X's and three O's?\n* When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available.

How many handshakes took place?\nThere are several ways to approach this problem. One way is to reason that, because 5 students each shake 4 hands, and each handshake involves 2 students, we counted \\(5\\cdot 4=20\\) handshakes but counted each handshake twice. So exactly 10 handshakes took place.\nAnother way to see this is to call the students \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and directly count the handshakes as follows. Student \\(a\\) shakes hands with 4 others, then student \\(b\\) shakes hands with 3 others besides \\(a\\), then student \\(c\\) shakes 2 more hands besides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then student \\(d\\) shakes 1 more hand (with \\(e\\)), and finally student \\(e\\) does not need to shake any more hands. So the total number of handshakes is \\(1+2+3+4=10\\).\nFinally, we can visually model this problem by drawing a dot to represent each student, and a line segment connecting each pair of dots to represent the handshakes:\nWith this visual tool, called a _graph_, we can count that there are 10 line segments (the handshakes) between the labeled dots (the students). The graph above is called \\(K_{5}\\), the \"complete graph on 5 vertices.\" The dots representing the students are called _vertices_ of the graph, and line segments between the vertices are called _edges_. The intersection points of the line segments which are not labeled should be ignored; they are not vertices. We say the graph is _complete_ because every two vertices are connected by an edge.\nIn this class, Introduction to Combinatorics, we will learn about counting problems, mathematical proofs, generating functions, and graph theory. Here are some examples of questions that we will answer. These questions will become more complicated when we later increase the number of students beyond 5.\n**Chapters 2-4: Basic counting, sets, and binomial coefficients.**\n1.

We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket.

We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

Then the expansion of \\((x+y)^{n}\\) is_\n\\[(x+y)^{n}=\\binom{n}{0}x^{n}+\\binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}y^{1}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{k}x^{n-k }y^{k}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}x^{1}y^{n-1}+\\binom{n}{n}y^{n}.\\]\nProof.: Note\n\\[(x+y)^{n}=\\underbrace{(x+y)\\cdot(x+y)\\cdot(x+y)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(x+y)\\cdot(x+ y)}_{n\\text{ times}}.\\]\nIn expanding this product, we need to take one entry from each term, multiply these entries together, and then add all those products ('the giant foil method'). For each of the \\(n\\) terms \\((x+y)\\), we have the option to choose either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). Since there are \\(n\\) terms, the product of these will be a monomial of the form \\(x^{n-k}y^{k}\\) for some number \\(k\\). To produce the monomial \\(x^{n-k}y^{k}\\) in the product, we must choose the variable \\(y\\) for a total of \\(k\\) times and then choose the variable \\(x\\) for the remaining \\(n-k\\) times. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) ways to choose \\(k\\) terms out of the \\(n\\) terms. So the coefficient of \\(x^{n-k}y^{k}\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\).\nFor example, if you expand \\((x+y)^{10}\\) and combine like terms, then the coefficient in front of \\(x^{8}y^{2}\\) will be \\(\\binom{10}{2}=45\\). This comes from the fact that out of the \\(10\\) terms \\(x+y\\) being multiplied together, we need to choose the variable \\(y\\) from \\(2\\) of them (and the variable \\(x\\) from the remaining \\(8\\) of them) in order to produce the monomial \\(x^{8}y^{2}\\).\n**Remark 4.2.3**.: By combining the Binomial Theorem with Pascal's triangle, we can quickly expand powers of the sum of two things! For instance, by reading row \\(n=6\\) from Pascal's triangle, we can immediately deduce that\n\\[(x+y)^{6}=x^{6}+6x^{5}y+15x^{4}y^{2}+20x^{3}y^{3}+15x^{2}y^{4}+6xy^{5}+y^{6}.\\]\nBy reading row \\(n=3\\) from Pascal's triangle, we can deduce that\n\\[(a^{2}+5b)^{3} = (a^{2})^{3}+3(a^{2})^{2}(5b)+3(a^{2})(5b)^{2}+(5b)^{3}\\] \\[= a^{6}+15a^{4}b+75a^{2}b^{2}+125b^{3}.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

The players mark the squares of the grid with the symbols X and O. This exercise uses Polya's enumeration theorem to investigate the number of different tic-tac-toe boards. (The analysis of _games_ is more complex, since it requires attention to the order the squares are marked and stopping when one player has won the game.)\n* Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the \\(9\\times 9\\) grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group \\(D_{8}\\) that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in Figure 15.16. For example, the effect of the transformation \\(r_{1}\\), which rotates the board \\(90^{\\circ}\\) clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as (13971)(2684)(5). Write each of the eight elements of \\(D_{8}\\) as permutations of the nine squares of a tic-tac-toe board.\n* Find the cycle index of \\(D_{8}\\) in terms of these permutations.\n* Make an appropriate substitution for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index to find a generating function \\(t(X,O)\\) in which the coefficient on \\(X^{i}O^{j}\\) is the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards having \\(i\\) squares filled by symbol X and \\(j\\) squares filled by symbol O. (Notice that some squares might be blank!)\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards are there?\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards have three X's and three O's?\n* When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers.
