        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to divide a set of 8 elements into 5 non-empty ordered subsets?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again.

More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\).

There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\).

In this problem, it is not enough to count the size of one set in two ways. Instead, we will use a _bijection_ to compare the size of two different sets.\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. A bijection is a matching or pairing of the elements of \\(A\\) with the elements of \\(B\\). Here is the formal definition.\n**Definition 5.4.2**.: Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be sets. Let \\(f:A\\to B\\) be a map.\n1. The map \\(f\\) is 1**-to-**1 if, whenever \\(a_{1}\\neq a_{2}\\), then \\(f(a_{1})\\neq f(a_{2})\\).\n2. The map \\(f\\) is **onto** if for every \\(b\\in B\\), there is an \\(a\\in A\\) such that \\(f(a)=b\\).\n3. The map \\(f\\) is a **bijection** if it is 1-to-1 and onto.\nIntuitively, the onto condition means that the map \\(f\\) hits every element of \\(B\\). Another way to say this is that the range of \\(f\\) is all of \\(B\\). The 1-to-1 condition means that no element of \\(B\\) is hit twice; it is equivalent to saying, if \\(f(a_{1})=f(a_{2})\\), then \\(a_{1}=a_{2}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day!

By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n2. This is a set partition since the blocks of students are not assigned to different days of the week. There are \\(4!\\) ways to order the \\(4\\) blocks. So we divide the answer to part (1) by \\(4!\\).\nAs a final application, we see what happens if we take a power of a sum of more than two variables. The answer to this question is why the expression \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{n}}\\) is often called a _multinomial coefficient_.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 2.1 Motivation\nStudents \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\)1 sat down in the library to start their combinatorics homework. They read the first problem that they were assigned.\nFootnote 1: To protect their privacy, students are identified by their first initial in this book.\n**Question 2.1.1**.: How many ways are there to choose 6 numbers from the set \\(\\{1,\\ldots,20\\}\\) so that at least four of them are odd?\nStudent \\(d\\) watched as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) each worked on the problem for several minutes, using paper, calculators, and tablets. Finally, student \\(d\\) said 'Hey, I don't know how to get started with this.'\n**Student \\(a\\)**: My thought is there are 10 odd numbers between 1 and 20. So there are 10 choices for the first odd number, 9 choices for the second, 8 choices for the third, and 7 choices for the fourth. The last two numbers can be odd or even and there are 16 numbers left. So that gives 16 choices for the fifth and 15 choices for the sixth. So the answer is\n\\[10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 16\\cdot 15=1,209,600.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: You're forgetting that the order doesn't matter. So first we need to choose four numbers out of the 10 odd numbers, then we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 16 numbers. So the answer is\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. A sequence of length \\(n\\) can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\). An infinite sequence can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer.\n#### Counting where order matters and repeats are allowed\nThe type of counting seen in Example 3.1.3, where **order matters** and **repeats are allowed**, can be restated in terms of counting sequences. Indeed, if we choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects in order, with repeats allowed, we can write them as a sequence from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols.\nWe can count such sequences as follows.\n**Theorem 3.2.4**.: _The number of sequences of length \\(k\\) composed from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols is \\(n^{k}\\). More generally, there are \\(n^{k}\\) combinations of \\(k\\) objects chosen from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: There are \\(n\\) ways to choose the first symbol in the sequence, then \\(n\\) ways to choose the second, and so on up to the \\(k\\)th. Therefore there are \\(n\\cdot n\\cdot n\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot n=n^{k}\\) possibilities.\nUsing Theorem 3.2.4, we can complete the general formula for one entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\n\n",

Also, there was a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points having \\(y\\) as its greatest element.\nNow suppose that \\(y>x\\) in \\(P\\). Then we can add \\(x\\) to \\(C^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(r+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its least element. This would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned in \\(A(r,s)\\).

In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Theorem 6.6.4**.: _A closed form formula for the \\(n\\)th Catalan number is_\n\\[C_{n}=\\binom{2n}{n}-\\binom{2n}{n+1}=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}.\\] (6.9)\nTheorem 6.6.4 will be proven later in Section 7.6. It is not hard to check that the two formulas for \\(C_{n}\\) in (6.9) are the same.\nCatalan numbers do not just count Dyck paths; in fact, there are 214 different known combinatorial descriptions of the Catalan numbers2! Let's consider some descriptions in the case \\(n=3\\).\nFootnote 2: All of these descriptions can be found in the book “Catalan Numbers” by Richard Stanley.\n**Example 6.6.5**.: The fact that \\(C_{3}=5\\) is equivalent to there being 5 ways to:\n1. put parentheses around 4 letters \\[((xy)z)w,\\ (x(yz))w,\\ (xy)(zw),\\ x((yz)w),\\ x(y(zw));\\]\n2. divide a convex pentagon into triangles;\n3. tile a stair of height 3 with 3 rectangles;\n4. arrange the numbers \\(\\{1,\\ldots,6\\}\\) in a \\(2\\times 3\\) grid so that each row and each column is increasing;\n5. pair the vertices of a hexagon so that the line segments joining paired vertices do not intersect;\n6. draw a rooted binary tree with 4 leaves such that every vertex has either 0 or 2 children (we will see more about trees in Chapter 9).\n7. write down a sequence \\((a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{6})\\) of 1's and \\(-1\\)'s such that each partial sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{j}\\) is nonnegative and the entire sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{6}\\) is 0. \\[(1,1,1,-1,-1,-1),(1,1,-1,1,-1,-1),(1,1,-1,1,-1),(1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1)\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### Derangements\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's short lecture video.\nDerangements\n**Example 6.5.1**.: How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in MAT, so that no letter is in its initial position? The answer is only 2 (out of the \\(3!=6\\) permutations): namely ATM and TMA.\n**Example 6.5.2**.: How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in MATH, so that no letter is in its initial position? The answer is only 9 (out of the \\(4!=24\\) permutations): namely:\nAMHT, ATHM, AHMT, TMHA, THMA, THAM, HMAT, HTMA, HTAM.\nIt is possible to check Examples 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 using the inclusion-exclusion principle, but it is not so easy.\n**Definition 6.5.3**.: A _derangement_ of a sequence \\(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) is a permutation such that no element \\(a_{i}\\) appears in its initial position (the \\(i\\)th spot). Let \\(D_{n}\\) be the number of derangements of a sequence of \\(n\\) distinct letters.\nWe can compute that \\(D_{1}=0\\), \\(D_{2}=1\\), \\(D_{3}=2\\), and \\(D_{4}=9\\). To compute \\(D_{n}\\) when \\(n\\) is larger, it is helpful to have a recurrence relation.\n**Proposition 6.5.4**.: _For \\(n\\geq 3\\), the number \\(D_{n}\\) of derangements of \\(n\\) objects satisfies the recurrence relation_\n\\[D_{n}=(n-1)(D_{n-1}+D_{n-2}).\\] (6.6)\nProof.: Let's work with derangements of the sequence \\(1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\). Given a derangement, let \\(c\\) be the number of the spot where 1 appears. Since \\(c\\neq 1\\) (else this would not be a valid derangement), there are \\(n-1\\) choices for \\(c\\). Once \\(c\\) is fixed, we have two cases.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nFor each permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\([n]\\), let \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) denote the subfamily of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consisting of all sets \\(S\\) from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) whose elements occur in a consecutive block around the circle. Then let \\(t=\\sum_{\\sigma}|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|\\).\nOur first claim is that \\(t\\leq kn!\\). To prove this, let \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation and suppose that \\(|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|=s\\geq 1\\). Then the union of the sets from \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) is a set of points that form a consecutive block of points on the circle. Note that since \\(n\\geq 2k\\), this block does not encompass the entire circle. Accordingly there is a set \\(S\\) whose elements are the first \\(k\\) in a clockwise sense within this block. Since each other set in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) represents a clockwise shift of one of more positions, it follows immediately that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq k\\). Since there are \\(n!\\) permutations, the claim follows.\nWe now claim that for each set \\(S\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), there are exactly \\(nk!(n-k)!\\) permutations \\(\\sigma\\) for which \\(S\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\). Note that there are \\(n\\) positions around the circle and each can be used as the first point in a block of \\(k\\) consecutive positions in which the elements of \\(S\\) can be placed. Then there are \\(k!\\) ways to order the elements of \\(S\\) and \\((n-k)!\\) ways to order the remaining elements. This proves our claim.\nTo complete the proof of the theorem, we note that we have\n\n\n",

Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\).

Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\nImagine the folders placed in a row. Then there are \\(17\\) gaps between them. Of these gaps, choose three and place a divider in each. Then this choice divides the folders into four non-empty sets. The first goes to Audrey, the second to Bart, etc. Thus the answer is \\(C(17,3)\\). In Figure 2.22, we illustrate this scheme with Audrey receiving \\(6\\) folders, Bart getting \\(1\\), Cecilia \\(4\\) and Darren \\(7\\).\n**Example 2.23**.: Suppose we redo the preceding problem but drop the restriction that each of the four employees gets at least one folder. Now how many ways can the distribution be made?\nFigure 2.22: Distributing Identical Objects into Distinct Cells\nSolution.The solution involves a \"trick\" of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by _artificially_ inflating everyone's allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get 7 folders, we say that he will get 8. Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by 4, one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of \\(22=18+4\\) folders. Again, choose 3 gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less--and may be zero. So the answer is \\(C(21,3)\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\n\n\n",

How many different different bouquets of 10 balloons are there that contain at least one balloon of each color? In this case, \\(m=10\\) and \\(n=6\\). Hence the number of ways is \\(\\binom{10-1}{6-1}=\\binom{9}{5}\\).\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n**Ramsey's theorem** says that the Ramsey number \\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is always finite; that is, there does exist some sufficiently large \\(n\\) for which the statement is true. But what is the minimum such number \\(n=R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\)? This is in general an unsolved problem, and the study of computing the Ramsey numbers is called _Ramsey theory_, and is one of a large class of optimization problems in graph theory involving coloring graphs.\n### Exercises\n1.

In its pair, \\(A_{1}\\) is called the _outer twin_ and \\(A_{2}\\) is called the _inner twin_ (and similarly for all other twin pairs).\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction this graph were 3-colorable. Without loss of generality let the central vertex be Red. So all 5 inner vertices are Blue or Green. A way of coloring the vertices that agrees with this choice is shown below (but naturally is not a 3-coloring - we will just pretend that it is a valid coloring as an illustration).\nWe will show that, if this coloring is a valid 3-coloring, then we can use it to produce a valid 2-coloring of the outer 5-cycle (but _not_ of the entire graph) as follows: if any outer twin is colored Red, replace Red with the color of its inner twin (Blue or Green). Then in this coloring of the outer cycle with Blue and Green, if an outer twin \\(v\\) is changed from Red to Blue (for example), then both of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins must be Green. Indeed, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been Blue since they are each connected to \\(v\\)'s inner twin which is Blue. Also, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been changed from Red (to any other color) since \\(v\\) was originally Red.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 5.6.12**.: Consider the complete graph \\(K_{6}\\) with 6 vertices (every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge). If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).

How many ways can we try to continue this coloring?\nR = Red, B = Blue, G = Green\nThe number of options to try explodes!\n**Remark 12.4.1**.: One example application of coloring graphs is to scheduling. Suppose for example that you are the math department chair, with a collection of math classes that need to be taught. The times for these classes are already fixed. What is the minimum number of instructors you need to hire?\nYou can solve this problem by building a graph with a vertex for each math class, and by adding an edge between two vertices if the corresponding classes overlap in time. The minimum number of colors needed to color this graph is the same as the minimum possible number of instructors you need to hire.\nSee Problem #4 in Section 12.7 for another example scheduling application.\n**Remark 12.4.2**.: Deciding if a graph with \\(n\\) vertices is 3-colorable in general takes running time \\(\\approx 2^{n/2}\\). This is expensive. Nothing substantially better is known for \\(k\\)-colorings for any \\(k\\geq 3\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nBy now the pattern is becoming apparent. If we substitute \\(w^{i}+g^{i}\\) for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index for each \\(i\\), we then keep track of how many vertices are colored white and how many are colored gold. The simplification of the cycle index in this case is then a generating function in which the coefficient on \\(g^{s}w^{t}\\) is the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of the square with \\(s\\) vertices colored gold and \\(t\\) vertices colored white. Doing this and simplifying gives\n\\[P_{D_{8}}(w+g,w^{2}+g^{2},w^{3}+g^{3},w^{4}+g^{4})=g^{4}+g^{3}w+2g^{2}w^{2}+gw ^{3}+w^{4}.\\]\nFrom this we find one coloring with all vertices gold, one coloring with all vertices white, one coloring with three gold vertices and one white vertex, one coloring with one gold vertex and three white vertices, and two colorings with two vertices of each color.\nAs with the other results we've discovered in this chapter, this property of the cycle index holds up beyond the case of coloring the vertices of the square with two colors.

So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n**Ramsey's theorem** says that the Ramsey number \\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is always finite; that is, there does exist some sufficiently large \\(n\\) for which the statement is true.

We start with a classical example.\n**Example 10.4.1**.: Six people walk into a room; some of the people know each other already and others do not. Prove that either some three of them all mutually know each other, or some three of them all mutually do not know each other.\nTo get a handle on the above problem, we can first model it as a graph theory problem; consider a graph on \\(6\\) vertices that represent the people, and where each pair of people is connected either by a solid or dashed edge according to whether they know each other or not, as shown:\nIn the above graph, notice that the vertices numbered \\(3,4,6\\) all mutually do not know each other. Their induced subgraph is a smaller complete graph \\(K_{3}\\), with all its edges the same \"color\" (where the two colors are solid and dashed in this case, but any two colors would work). To state our problem more precisely in terms of graphs, we make the following two definitions.\n**Definition 10.4.2**.: An \\(m\\)**-clique** in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to \\(K_{m}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nBy the pigeonhole principle, one of the smaller triangles must contain the striking points of at least two arrows. The distance between these striking points is at most the length of the side of the smaller triangle. It follows that the striking points of those two arrows are within \\(1\\) meter of each other.\n**Example 5.6.6**.: There are \\(n\\) guests at a party, for some integer \\(n\\geq 2\\). Some pairs of them shake hands; (no one shakes hands with themself). Prove that at least two guests shook hands with the same number of people.\nEach guest shook between \\(0\\) and \\(n-1\\) hands. Let's label the boxes by the numbers \\(0\\) through \\(n-1\\) and put a person in box \\(i\\) if they shook hands with exactly \\(i\\) people. At first, it does not look like we can use the pigeonhole principle because there are \\(n\\) people and \\(n\\) boxes.\nHowever, there is one piece of information we did not use. Either box \\(0\\) or box \\(n-1\\) is empty. The reason is that if someone shook \\(0\\) hands, then no one shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests; if someone shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests, then no one shook \\(0\\) hands. Hence we are assigning \\(n\\) people to \\(n-1\\) boxes (labeled either by \\(0\\) through \\(n-2\\) or by \\(1\\) through \\(n-1\\)). By the pigeonhole principle, two people must be assigned to the same box, and hence shook the same number of hands.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

We divide by \\(k!\\) since the order of choosing the numbers does not matter.\n**Method 2:** There are \\(n!\\) ways to line up the numbers in \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\). We then choose the first \\(k\\) elements in line.

There are 50! ways to assign the students and ghosts to chairs. There are 3! ways to rearrange the 3 ghosts without changing the arrangement of the students.

Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n**Example 5.6.11**.: If 17 people are seated in a circle of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 6 chairs are filled with people.\n_Answer._ The 3 empty chairs partition the circle into \\(n=3\\) \"boxes\" of consecutively filled chairs. Let \\(k+1=6\\), so \\(k=5\\). Since \\(17>15=5\\cdot 3=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=6\\) objects, which are consecutively filled chairs.\nOne of the most fun applications of the pigeonhole principle is to _Ramsey theory_.

When they arrive at the ice cream shop, they need to wait in line. Student \\(a\\) argues they should wait in alphabetical order, but student \\(g\\) has a strong opposition to this ordering. This prompts the question: How many different ways are there for them to wait in an ordered line?\nTo solve this kind of problem, we need the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.1**.: A **permutation** of \\(n\\) objects is an ordering or arrangement of all \\(n\\) of them.\nA permutation can be expressed as a sequence or string.\n**Example 3.3.2**.: For example, the set \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\) has 6 permutations:\n\\[abc\\quad acb\\quad bac\\quad cab\\quad cba\\]\n**Example 3.3.3**.: To write down a permutation of the set \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}\\), we use sequence notation rather than string notation, since 10 has two digits. One possible permutation is:\n\\[(3,6,7,2,1,10,4,5,9,8).\\]\nRecall that \\(n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\), and we pronounce the symbol \\(n!\\) as \"\\(n\\) factorial\".\n**Theorem 3.3.4**.: _The number of permutations of \\(n\\) objects is \\(n!\\)._\nProof.: By Theorem 3.2.9, there are \\(n\\) choices for the first object, then \\(n-1\\) choices for the second object, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on until there is only one 1 choice remaining for the \\(n\\)th object. So there are \\(n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=n!\\) permutations in total.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### Exercises\n1.

Find the number \\(S_{n}\\) of ways that the seats can be filled by an arbitrary number of people, so that no two people sit next to each other. For example, \\(S_{1}=2\\) since the one seat can be empty or full. Letting \\(e\\) denote empty and \\(f\\) denote full, we see that \\(S_{2}=3\\), because the choices are \\(ee\\), \\(fe\\), or \\(ef\\). Show that \\(S_{n}=F_{n+2}\\) for \\(n\\geq 3\\).\n4. _Counting Rocks!_ There are \\(n\\) large rocks in a row. Prove that \\(F_{n+2}\\) is equal to the number of ways to paint each rock either silver or navy, in such a way that no two silver rocks are next to each other.\n5. How many subsets of the set \\(\\{1,2,3,...,9\\}\\) contain no two consecutive integers?\n6. What number do the successive quotients \\(\\frac{F_{2}}{F_{1}}\\), \\(\\frac{F_{3}}{F_{2}}\\), \\(\\frac{F_{4}}{F_{3}}\\), ..., \\(\\frac{F_{n}}{F_{n-1}}\\), \\(\\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_{n}}\\), ...approach as \\(n\\) gets larger and larger?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n\n\n",

Polya's approach to counting allows us to use symmetries (such as those of geometric objects like polygons) to form generating functions. These generating functions can then be used to answer combinatorial questions such as\nFootnote 1: Like so many results of mathematics, the crux of the result was originally discovered by someone other than the mathematician whose name is associated with it. J.H. Redfield published this result in 1927, 10 years prior to Polya’s work. It would take until 1960 for Redfield’s work to be discovered, by which time Polya’s name was firmly attached to the technique.\n1. How many different necklaces of six beads can be formed using red, blue and green beads? What about 500-bead necklaces?\n2. How many musical scales consisting of 6 notes are there?\n3.

There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Notation 3.5.4**.: The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements are chosen from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is sometimes written \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). We pronounce this symbol \"\\(n\\) multichoose \\(k\\)\" or \"\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\) with repeats\".\n#### Counting multisets with sticks and stones\nTo count the number of multisets of a certain kind, we use what we call the \"sticks and stones\" method. (In other sources, this is sometimes called the \"stars and bars\" method.) We illustrate this method first with an example.\n**Example 3.5.5**.: Suppose we have an unlimited supply of 5 kinds of fruit: apples, bananas, mangoes, oranges, and pears. Let's write them as A, B, M, O, and P for short. How many ways can we make a bag of 6 fruits?\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\\[\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\mid\\bullet.\\]\nThe first stone indicates that there is one apple, then the next two stones indicates that there are two bananas, and so on. There are no stones between the last two sticks because there are no oranges in the bag.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nis defined to be the number of anagrams of \\(W\\).\n**Theorem 4.5.7**.: _The multinomial coefficient has the following formula:_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot k_{m}!}.\\] (4.1)\nWe prove Theorem 4.5.7 in Section 4.6.\n**Example 4.5.8**.: How many anagrams are there for the word MISSISSIPPI? In this case \\(n=11\\), \\(m=4\\), \\(k_{1}=4\\) (the I's), \\(k_{2}=1\\) (the M), \\(k_{3}=2\\) (the P's) and \\(k_{4}=4\\) (the S's). So the answer is \\(11!/(4!\\cdot 1!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 4!)\\).\nExercises\n1. How many anagrams does the word BANANA have? For example, NABNAA and NANABA are two anagrams of BANANA.\n2. How many ways can you rearrange the letters in the word MOON?\n3. How many anagrams does the word HORSETOOTH have?\n4. How many anagrams does the word TENNESSEE have?\n5. Consider all anagrams of the word SPEEDED. How many ways are there for you to make a ranked list of your top 5 favorite anagrams, numbered \\(\\#1\\) to \\(\\#5\\), of SPEEDED?\n6. How many paths are there from \\((0,0,0)\\) to \\((3,4,5)\\) in three-dimensional space, using only unit steps in directions \\((1,0,0)\\), \\((0,1,0)\\), and \\((0,0,1)\\)?\n7. Suppose \\(m=2\\). Show that \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2}}\\) is the familiar binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\) and show that the formula in (4.1) is the same as the formula \\(\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) found in Lemma 1.2.6 and Theorem 3.4.1.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 3.1.3**.: (Order matters, repeats allowed.) Suppose instead that your refrigerator is packed with plenty of fruits of each of the five types! So for instance, you can eat an apple on both Monday and Tuesday if you like - indeed, _repeats are allowed_. Now there are 5 choices for which type of fruit to eat each day, for a total of \\(5\\cdot 5=25\\) possibilities.\n**Example 3.1.4**.: (Order does not matter, repeats allowed) Finally, suppose _repeats are allowed_ (there are plenty of each type of fruit in the fridge) but _order doesn't matter_ (you are just grabbing two pieces of fruit to put in your lunch bag for Monday). Now there are 5 ways to pick the two pieces of fruit to be the same kind as each other, and if they're different, there are 10 possibilities as we saw in Example 3.1.1. In total, there are \\(10+5=15\\) possibilities.\nThe examples above show that the answer of \"how many ways can I choose two fruits from five\" can either be 10, 20, 25, or 15 depending on whether order matters and whether repeats are allowed! We can summarize our findings in the following table:\n**Number of ways to choose 2 pieces of fruit from 5 fruits**\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\).

The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\\[\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\mid\\bullet.\\]\nThe first stone indicates that there is one apple, then the next two stones indicates that there are two bananas, and so on.

It can be stated as follows.\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nis defined to be the number of anagrams of \\(W\\).\n**Theorem 4.5.7**.: _The multinomial coefficient has the following formula:_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot k_{m}!}.\\] (4.1)\nWe prove Theorem 4.5.7 in Section 4.6.\n**Example 4.5.8**.: How many anagrams are there for the word MISSISSIPPI? In this case \\(n=11\\), \\(m=4\\), \\(k_{1}=4\\) (the I's), \\(k_{2}=1\\) (the M), \\(k_{3}=2\\) (the P's) and \\(k_{4}=4\\) (the S's). So the answer is \\(11!/(4!\\cdot 1!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 4!)\\).\nExercises\n1. How many anagrams does the word BANANA have? For example, NABNAA and NANABA are two anagrams of BANANA.\n2.

How many six-character strings can be made using the Hawaiian alphabet?\n**2.** How many \\(2n\\)-digit positive integers can be formed if the digits in odd positions (counting the rightmost digit as position 1) must be odd and the digits in even positions must be even and positive?\n**3.** Matt is designing a website authentication system. He knows passwords are most secure if they contain letters, numbers, and symbols. However, he doesn't quite understand that this additional security is defeated if he specifies in which positions each character type appears.

How many different passwords are there for his website system? How does this compare to the total number of strings of length 10 made from the alphabet of all uppercase and lowercase English letters, decimal digits, and 10 symbols?\n**4.** How many ternary strings of length \\(2n\\) are there in which the zeroes appear only in odd-numbered positions?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nBefore proceeding to an additional example, let's take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows.

Let \\(A\\) be the set of multiples of 3 in \\(S\\) and let \\(B\\) be the set of multiples of 7 in \\(S\\). The intersection \\(A\\cap B\\) is the set of multiples of 21.\nWe want to count the elements that are not in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). This is the complement of \\(A\\cup B\\) in \\(S\\). The number of these is\n\\[|S-(A\\cup B)|=210-|A\\cup B|.\\]\nThere are 70 multiples of 3 in \\(S\\) so \\(|A|=70\\). There are 30 multiples of 7 in \\(S\\) so \\(|B|=30\\). But if we subtract both 70 and 30 from 210, we've removed each multiple of 21 twice, since it is divisible by both 3 and 7. There are 10 multiples of 21 that we removed twice, so we add 10 to the count. So the answer is \\(210-70-30+10=120\\).\nWe state the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets and then for three sets.\n**Theorem 2.7.3** (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets).: _Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two finite sets.

A permutation of length four chosen from \\(X\\) is then a slate of officers by considering the first name in the permutation as the President, the second as the Vice President, the third as the Secretary, and the fourth as the Treasurer.

This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\).

He knows passwords are most secure if they contain letters, numbers, and symbols. However, he doesn't quite understand that this additional security is defeated if he specifies in which positions each character type appears. He decides that valid passwords for his system will begin with three letters (uppercase and lowercase both allowed), followed by two digits, followed by one of 10 symbols, followed by two uppercase letters, followed by a digit, followed by one of 10 symbols. How many different passwords are there for his website system? How does this compare to the total number of strings of length 10 made from the alphabet of all uppercase and lowercase English letters, decimal digits, and 10 symbols?\n**4.** How many ternary strings of length \\(2n\\) are there in which the zeroes appear only in odd-numbered positions?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBefore proceeding to an additional example, let's take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion.

Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n1. 1.

Find the number of all strings of four letters in which letters which differ by one slot are not the same, and also letters which differ by two slots are not the same. For example, string \\(xwzz\\) does not count since there are \\(z\\)'s which differ by one slot, string \\(xzwz\\) does not count since there are \\(z\\)'s which differ by two slots, but string \\(zxwz\\) is okay.\n2.

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\nwhich there are no restrictions, a factor of \\(e^{7x}\\) is introduced. To account for an even number of \\(0\\)s, he uses \\((e^{x}+e^{-x})/2\\). For at least one \\(1\\), a factor of \\(e^{x}-1\\) is required. Finally, \\(1+x+x^{2}/2!+x^{3}/3!\\) accounts for the restriction of at most three \\(2\\)s. The exponential generating function for the number of \\(n\\)-digit passcodes is thus\n\\[e^{7x}\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}(e^{x}-1)\\left(1+x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3! }\\right).\\]\n\n\n",

What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor).

In other words, there is a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) with \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})=10^{6}\\) but no cycle with fewer than \\(10^{10}\\) vertices!\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other).

Just take one at random and you are almost certain to get one. And as a general rule, probabilistic techniques often provide a method for finding something that readily exists, but is hard to find.\nSimilarly, in the probabilistic proof that there exist graphs with large girth and large chromatic number (Theorem 11.7), we actually showed that almost all graphs have modest sized independence number and relatively few small cycles, provided that the edge probability is chosen appropriately. The small cycles can be destroyed without significantly changing the size of the graph.\nBy way of contrast, probabilistic techniques can, in certain circumstances, be used to find something which is exceedingly rare. We next present an elegant but elementary result, known as the Lovasz Local Lemma, which has proved to be very, very powerful. The treatment is simplified by the following natural notation. When \\(E\\) is an event in a probability space, we let \\(\\overline{E}\\) denote the complement of \\(E\\) . Also, when \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{E_{1},E_{2},\\ldots,E_{k}\\}\\) we let\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n#### 5.4.2 Cliques and Chromatic Number\nA **clique** in a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}=(V,E)\\) is a set \\(K\\subseteq V\\) such that the subgraph induced by \\(K\\) is isomorphic to the complete graph \\(\\mathbf{K}_{|K|}\\). Equivalently, we can say that every pair of vertices in \\(K\\) are adjacent. The **maximum clique size** or **clique number** of a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), denoted \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\) , is the largest \\(t\\) for which there exists a clique \\(K\\) with \\(|K|=t\\). For example, the graph in Figure 5.14 has clique number \\(4\\) while the graph in Figure 5.19 has maximum clique size \\(2\\).\nFor every graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), it is obvious that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})\\geq\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\). On the other hand, the inequality may be far from tight. Before proving showing how bad it can be, we need to introduce a more general version of the Pigeon Hole Principle. Consider a function \\(f\\colon X\\to Y\\) with \\(|X|=2|Y|+1\\). Since \\(|X|>|Y|\\), the Pigeon Hole Principle as stated in Proposition 4.1 only tells us that there are distinct \\(x,x^{\\prime}\\in X\\) with \\(f(x)=f(x^{\\prime})\\). However, we can say more here. Suppose that each element of \\(Y\\) has at most two elements of \\(X\\) mapped to it. Then adding up the number of elements of \\(X\\) based on how many are mapped to each element of \\(Y\\) would only allow \\(X\\) to have (at most) \\(2|Y|\\) elements. Thus, there must be \\(y\\in Y\\) so that there are three distinct elements \\(x,x^{\\prime},x^{\\prime\\prime}\\in X\\) with \\(f(x)=f(x^{\\prime})=f(x^{\\prime\\prime})=y\\). This argument generalizes to give the following version of\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe list of applications of the Local Lemma has been growing steadily, as has the interest in how the lemma can be applied algorithmically, i.e., in a constructive setting. But here we present one of the early applications to Ramsey theory--estimating the Ramsey number \\((R,3,n)\\). Recall that we have the basic inequality \\(R(3,n)\\leq\\binom{n+1}{3}\\) from Theorem 11.2, and it is natural to turn to the probabilistic method to look for good lower bounds. But a few minutes thought shows that there are challenges to this approach.\nFirst, let's try a direct computation. Suppose we try a random graph on \\(t\\) vertices with edge probability \\(p\\). So we would want no triangles, and that would say we need \\(t^{3}p^{3}=1\\), i.e., \\(p=1/t\\). Then we would want no independent sets of size \\(n\\), which would require \\(n^{t}e^{-pn^{2}}=1\\), i.e., \\(t\\ln n=pn^{2}\\), so we can't even make \\(t\\) larger than \\(n\\). That's not helpful.\nWe can do a bit better by allowing some triangles and then removing one point from each, as was done in the proof for Theorem 11.7. Along these lines, we would set \\(t^{3}p^{3}=t\\), i.e., \\(p=t^{-2/3}\\). And the calculation now yields the lower bound \\(R(3,n)\\geq n^{6/5}/\\ln^{-3/5}n\\), so even the exponent of \\(n\\) is different from the upper bound.\n\n\n",

The two colors we will use are gray and white.\nFor the base case \\(n=1\\), note that we can draw the inside of our single circle gray, and the outside white.\nFor the inductive step, suppose the theorem is true for any \\(n-1\\) circles.

If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.

We start with a classical example.\n**Example 10.4.1**.: Six people walk into a room; some of the people know each other already and others do not. Prove that either some three of them all mutually know each other, or some three of them all mutually do not know each other.\nTo get a handle on the above problem, we can first model it as a graph theory problem; consider a graph on \\(6\\) vertices that represent the people, and where each pair of people is connected either by a solid or dashed edge according to whether they know each other or not, as shown:\nIn the above graph, notice that the vertices numbered \\(3,4,6\\) all mutually do not know each other. Their induced subgraph is a smaller complete graph \\(K_{3}\\), with all its edges the same \"color\" (where the two colors are solid and dashed in this case, but any two colors would work). To state our problem more precisely in terms of graphs, we make the following two definitions.\n**Definition 10.4.2**.: An \\(m\\)**-clique** in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to \\(K_{m}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nBy the pigeonhole principle, one of the smaller triangles must contain the striking points of at least two arrows. The distance between these striking points is at most the length of the side of the smaller triangle. It follows that the striking points of those two arrows are within \\(1\\) meter of each other.\n**Example 5.6.6**.: There are \\(n\\) guests at a party, for some integer \\(n\\geq 2\\). Some pairs of them shake hands; (no one shakes hands with themself). Prove that at least two guests shook hands with the same number of people.\nEach guest shook between \\(0\\) and \\(n-1\\) hands. Let's label the boxes by the numbers \\(0\\) through \\(n-1\\) and put a person in box \\(i\\) if they shook hands with exactly \\(i\\) people. At first, it does not look like we can use the pigeonhole principle because there are \\(n\\) people and \\(n\\) boxes.\nHowever, there is one piece of information we did not use. Either box \\(0\\) or box \\(n-1\\) is empty. The reason is that if someone shook \\(0\\) hands, then no one shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests; if someone shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests, then no one shook \\(0\\) hands. Hence we are assigning \\(n\\) people to \\(n-1\\) boxes (labeled either by \\(0\\) through \\(n-2\\) or by \\(1\\) through \\(n-1\\)). By the pigeonhole principle, two people must be assigned to the same box, and hence shook the same number of hands.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

They read the first problem that they were assigned.\nFootnote 1: To protect their privacy, students are identified by their first initial in this book.\n**Question 2.1.1**.: How many ways are there to choose 6 numbers from the set \\(\\{1,\\ldots,20\\}\\) so that at least four of them are odd?\nStudent \\(d\\) watched as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) each worked on the problem for several minutes, using paper, calculators, and tablets.

So there are 10 choices for the first odd number, 9 choices for the second, 8 choices for the third, and 7 choices for the fourth. The last two numbers can be odd or even and there are 16 numbers left. So that gives 16 choices for the fifth and 15 choices for the sixth.

So first we need to choose four numbers out of the 10 odd numbers, then we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 16 numbers. So the answer is\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\).

Then \\(B\\subseteq A\\) and \\(B\\) is exactly the subset of elements of \\(A\\) that are a multiple of \\(5\\). So \\(|A-B|=25-5=20\\).\n### Exercises\n1.

In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\nImagine the folders placed in a row. Then there are \\(17\\) gaps between them. Of these gaps, choose three and place a divider in each. Then this choice divides the folders into four non-empty sets. The first goes to Audrey, the second to Bart, etc. Thus the answer is \\(C(17,3)\\). In Figure 2.22, we illustrate this scheme with Audrey receiving \\(6\\) folders, Bart getting \\(1\\), Cecilia \\(4\\) and Darren \\(7\\).\n**Example 2.23**.: Suppose we redo the preceding problem but drop the restriction that each of the four employees gets at least one folder. Now how many ways can the distribution be made?\nFigure 2.22: Distributing Identical Objects into Distinct Cells\nSolution.The solution involves a \"trick\" of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by _artificially_ inflating everyone's allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get 7 folders, we say that he will get 8. Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by 4, one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of \\(22=18+4\\) folders. Again, choose 3 gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less--and may be zero. So the answer is \\(C(21,3)\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of ordered subsets of size \\(k\\) from a set with \\(n\\) elements is_\n\\[n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\] (3.1)\n_More generally, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: An ordered subset of size \\(k\\) is a sequence of length \\(k\\) chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) in which no two entries are equal. There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\n\n",

Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n3. A sequence of length \\(n\\) can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\). An infinite sequence can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer.\n#### Counting where order matters and repeats are allowed\nThe type of counting seen in Example 3.1.3, where **order matters** and **repeats are allowed**, can be restated in terms of counting sequences. Indeed, if we choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects in order, with repeats allowed, we can write them as a sequence from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols.\nWe can count such sequences as follows.\n**Theorem 3.2.4**.: _The number of sequences of length \\(k\\) composed from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols is \\(n^{k}\\). More generally, there are \\(n^{k}\\) combinations of \\(k\\) objects chosen from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: There are \\(n\\) ways to choose the first symbol in the sequence, then \\(n\\) ways to choose the second, and so on up to the \\(k\\)th. Therefore there are \\(n\\cdot n\\cdot n\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot n=n^{k}\\) possibilities.\nUsing Theorem 3.2.4, we can complete the general formula for one entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nSolution.Both sides count the number of \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\)-strings of length \\(n\\), the right hand side first partitioning them according to positions in the string which are not \\(2\\). (For instance, if \\(6\\) of the positions are not \\(2\\), we must first choose those \\(6\\) positions in \\(C(n,6)\\) ways and then there are \\(2^{6}\\) ways to fill in those six positions by choosing either a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\) for each position.)\n**Example 2.20**.: Explain why, for each non-negative integer \\(n\\),\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n}=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{ n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nSolution.Both sides count the number of bit strings of length \\(2n\\) with half the bits being \\(0^{\\prime}\\)s, with the right side first partitioning them according to the number of \\(1^{\\prime}\\)s occurring in the first \\(n\\) positions of the string. Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 2.1 Motivation\nStudents \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\)1 sat down in the library to start their combinatorics homework. They read the first problem that they were assigned.\nFootnote 1: To protect their privacy, students are identified by their first initial in this book.\n**Question 2.1.1**.: How many ways are there to choose 6 numbers from the set \\(\\{1,\\ldots,20\\}\\) so that at least four of them are odd?\nStudent \\(d\\) watched as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) each worked on the problem for several minutes, using paper, calculators, and tablets. Finally, student \\(d\\) said 'Hey, I don't know how to get started with this.'\n**Student \\(a\\)**: My thought is there are 10 odd numbers between 1 and 20. So there are 10 choices for the first odd number, 9 choices for the second, 8 choices for the third, and 7 choices for the fourth. The last two numbers can be odd or even and there are 16 numbers left. So that gives 16 choices for the fifth and 15 choices for the sixth. So the answer is\n\\[10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 16\\cdot 15=1,209,600.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: You're forgetting that the order doesn't matter. So first we need to choose four numbers out of the 10 odd numbers, then we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 16 numbers. So the answer is\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to divide a set of 5 elements into 2 non-empty ordered subsets?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of ordered subsets of size \\(k\\) from a set with \\(n\\) elements is_\n\\[n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\] (3.1)\n_More generally, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: An ordered subset of size \\(k\\) is a sequence of length \\(k\\) chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) in which no two entries are equal. There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\n\n\n",

Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners.

A valid coloring of the map, with no adjacent regions of the same color, corresponds to a vertex coloring of the graph, meaning that no adjacent vertices have the same color.\nLet us explain why this map requires at least 4 colors, in order for adjacent regions to have different colors. Suppose for a contradiction 3 colors sufficed. Without loss of generality, color the region 'N' red, color the region 'C' blue, and color the region 'O' green. Then necessarily the region 'I' must be blue, as it is already adjacent to green and red regions, and we have only three colors at our disposal. And similarly, the region 'U' must now necessarily be green. There is now no valid color for region 'A', as it is already adjacent to regions labeled blue, red, and green. Hence at least 4 colors are needed to color this map!\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n6. You want to make a bouquet of 50 balloons, and there are 10 different colors to choose from. All balloons of the same color are the same, and there are an unlimited number of balloons of each color. How many different bouquets can you make?

Explain why Corollary 3.5.15 is true.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nLet us explain why this map requires at least 4 colors, in order for adjacent regions to have different colors. Suppose for a contradiction 3 colors sufficed. Without loss of generality, color the region 'N' red, color the region 'C' blue, and color the region 'O' green. Then necessarily the region 'I' must be blue, as it is already adjacent to green and red regions, and we have only three colors at our disposal. And similarly, the region 'U' must now necessarily be green. There is now no valid color for region 'A', as it is already adjacent to regions labeled blue, red, and green. Hence at least 4 colors are needed to color this map!\nBelow is a smaller map that requires 4 colors so that adjacent regions are not of the same color. Indeed, the planar graph corresponding to this map is \\(K_{4}\\), the complete graph on four vertices, which requires at least 4 colors.\nAfter successfully coloring many large maps with only four colors, our cartographer begins to wonder if _all_ planar maps can be colored with four colors. This is true and is now called the four-color theorem; it states that any map drawn on the plane or the surface of a sphere can be colored using four colors in such a way that areas with a common boundary are not the same color.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car.

For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1.

For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10.

Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\).

We define the _chromatic polynomial_ of \\(G\\) as the polynomial whose value at the input \\(k\\) is the number of \\(k\\)-colorings.\nHere is an application to a real-world scenario. Suppose you have \\(k\\) employees and \\(n\\) jobs and some of the jobs conflict with each other, then how many ways are there to assign the employees to the jobs? In this scenario, let \\(G\\) be the labeled graph with \\(n\\) vertices, where the vertices are labeled by the \\(n\\) jobs, and an\nedge is drawn between the vertices for two jobs exactly when those jobs conflict. Each employee is assigned one of the \\(k\\) colors. Making an assignment of the employees to the jobs is the same as making a \\(k\\)-coloring of \\(G\\). If the number of employees is less than the chromatic number \\(C(G)\\), then there is no way to create a proper vertex-coloring of a graph. However, for any \\(k\\geq C(G)\\), we want to find a way to represent the number of different vertex-colorings. In fact, we can do such a thing with a polynomial. Now we want to study the number of ways to \\(k\\)-color a labeled graph.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 14.2 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs\nAs an example, in Figure 14.3, the thick edges form a matching from \\(V_{1}\\) to \\(V_{2}\\). Suppose that you're the manager of these workers (on the bottom) and must assign them to the jobs (on the top). Are you really making the best use of your resources by only putting four of six workers to work? There are no trivial ways to improve the number of busy workers, as the two without responsibilities right now cannot do any of the jobs that are unassigned. Perhaps there's a more efficient assignment that can be made by redoing some of the assignments, however. If there is, how should you go about finding it? If there is not, how would you justify to your boss that there's no better assignment of workers to jobs?\nAt the end of the section, we'll briefly look at a theorem on matchings in bipartite graphs that tells us precisely when an assignment of workers to jobs exists that ensures each worker has a job. First, however, we want to see how network flows can be used to find maximum matchings in bipartite graphs. The algorithm we give, while decent, is not the most efficient algorithm known for this problem. Therefore, it is not likely to be the one used in practice. However, it is a nice example of how network flows can be used to solve a combinatorial problem. The network that we use is formed from a bipartite graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) by placing an edge from the source \\(S\\) to each vertex of \\(V_{1}\\) and an edge from each vertex of \\(V_{2}\\) to the sink \\(T\\). The edges between \\(V_{1}\\) and \\(V_{2}\\) are oriented from \\(V_{1}\\) to \\(V_{2}\\), and _every_ edge is given capacity \\(1\\). Figure 14.4 contains the network corresponding to our graph from Figure 14.2. Edges in this network are all oriented from bottom to top and all edges have capacity \\(1\\). The vertices in \\(V_{1}\\) are \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{6}\\) in order from left to right, while the vertices in \\(V_{2}\\) are \\(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{7}\\) from left to right.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n4.

One very famous such object is called a _partition_. The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\nconsist of two 2-cycles, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose two elements for the first 2-cycle. The other two are then put in the second 2-cycle. However, this counts each permutation twice, once for when the first 2-cycle is the chosen pair and once for when it is the \"other two.\" Thus, there are 3 permutations consisting of two 2-cycles. Finally, only \\(\\iota\\) consists of four 1-cycles.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Proposition 5.25**.: _For every \\(t\\geq 3\\), there exists a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) so that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t})=t\\) and \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t})=2\\)._\nProof.: We proceed by induction on \\(t\\). For \\(t=3\\), we take \\(\\mathbf{G}_{3}\\) to be the cycle \\(\\mathbf{C}_{5}\\) on five vertices. Now assume that for some \\(t\\geq 3\\), we have determined the graph \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\). Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) has \\(n_{t}\\) vertices. Label the vertices of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n_{t}}\\). Construct \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\) as follows. Begin with an independent set \\(I\\) of cardinality \\(t(n_{t}-1)+1\\). For every subset \\(S\\) of \\(I\\) with \\(|S|=n_{t}\\), label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(y_{1},y_{2},\\ldots,y_{n_{t}}\\). For this particular \\(n_{t}\\)-element subset attach a copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with \\(y_{i}\\) adjacent to \\(x_{i}\\) for \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,n_{t}\\). Vertices in copies of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) for distinct \\(n_{t}\\)-element subsets of \\(I\\) are nonadjacent, and a vertex in \\(I\\) has at most one neighbor in a particular copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\).\nTo see that \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=2\\), it will suffice to argue that \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\) contains no triangle (\\(\\mathbf{K}_{3}\\)). Since \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) is triangle-free, any triangle in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\) must contain a vertex of \\(I\\). Since none of the vertices of \\(I\\) are adjacent, any triangle in \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\) contains only one point of \\(I\\). Since each vertex of \\(I\\) is adjacent to at most one vertex of any fixed copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\), if \\(y\\in I\\) is part of a triangle, the other two vertices must come from distinct copies of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\). However, vertices in different copies of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) are not adjacent, so \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=2\\). Notice that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})\\geq t\\) since \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\) contains \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\). On the other hand, \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})\\leq t+1\\) since we may use \\(t\\) colors on the copies of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) and a new color on the independent set \\(I\\). To see that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t+1\\), observe that if we use only \\(t\\) colors, then by the generalized Pigeon Hole Principle, there is an \\(n_{t}\\)-element subset of \\(I\\) in which all vertices have the same color. Then this color cannot be used in the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) which is attached to that \\(n_{t}\\)-element subset.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWhen \\(y\\) was presented, there was at that moment in time a chain \\(C^{\\prime}\\) of \\(r\\) points having \\(y\\) as its least element. Also, there was a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points having \\(y\\) as its greatest element.\nNow suppose that \\(y>x\\) in \\(P\\). Then we can add \\(x\\) to \\(C^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(r+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its least element. This would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned in \\(A(r,s)\\). Similarly, if \\(y<x\\) in \\(P\\), then we may add \\(x\\) to \\(D^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(s+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its greatest element. Again, this would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned to \\(A(r,s)\\).\nSo Assigner has indeed devised a good strategy for partitioning \\(P\\) into antichains, but how many antichains has she used? This is just asking how many ordered pairs \\((i,j)\\) of positive integers are there subject to the restriction that \\(i+j-1\\leq h\\). And we learned how to solve this kind of question in Chapter 2. The answer of course is \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\).\nThe strategy for Assigner is so simple and natural, it might be the case that a more complex strategy would yield a more efficient partitioning. Not so.\n**Theorem 16.5** (Szemeredi).: _For every \\(h\\geq 1\\), there is a strategy \\(S_{h}\\) for builder that will enable him to build a poset \\(P\\) of height \\(h\\) so that assigner is forced to (1) use at least \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\) antichains in partitioning \\(P\\), and (2) use at least \\(h\\) different antichains on the set of maximal elements._\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSince we're only after the cycle index of \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), we don't need to find all 24 permutations in the pair group. However, we do need to know the types of those permutations in terms of cycle lengths so we can associate the appropriate monomials. For the three examples we've considered, the cycle structure of the permutation in the pair group doesn't depend on the original permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) other than for _its_ cycle structure. Any permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a 2-cycle and two 1-cycles will correspond to a permutation with two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\). A permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) with one 3-cycle and one 1-cycle will correspond to a permutation with two 3-cycles in the pair group. By considering an example of a permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a single 4-cycle, we find that the corresponding permutation in the pair group has a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. Finally, a permutation of \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of two 2-cycles corresponds to a permutation in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\) having two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles. (Exercise 15.6.8 asks you to verify these claims using specific permutations.)\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\n\n\n",

Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line.

We restrict attention to _convex_ polyhedra in three-dimensional space. The word convex means that the polyhedron is an intersection of half-spaces, or equivalently, it means that the polyhedron is the convex hull of its set of vertices, though we do not expect you to know what all of these words mean.\nHere are some prisms, which are examples of polyhedra.\nTriangular prism: 6 vertices, 9 edges, 5 faces\nPentagonal prism: 10 vertices, 15 edges, 7 faces\nThe most famous polyhedra are the _Platonic solids_. These are the only _regular polyhedra_, where the word regular means that all the faces are the same shape, all the edges are the same length, and all the interior angles are the same.\nTetrahedron: 4 vertices, 6 edges, 4 faces\nCube: 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 faces\nOctahedron: 6 vertices, 12 edges, 8 faces\nDodecahedron: 20 vertices, 30 edges, 12 faces\nIcosahedron: 12 vertices, 30 edges, 20 faces\n**Remark 11.4.1**.: Each polyhedron \\(P\\) has a dual \\(P^{D}\\).

These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right. Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n**Example 5.6.11**.: If 17 people are seated in a circle of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 6 chairs are filled with people.\n_Answer._ The 3 empty chairs partition the circle into \\(n=3\\) \"boxes\" of consecutively filled chairs. Let \\(k+1=6\\), so \\(k=5\\). Since \\(17>15=5\\cdot 3=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=6\\) objects, which are consecutively filled chairs.\nOne of the most fun applications of the pigeonhole principle is to _Ramsey theory_.

Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nBy now the pattern is becoming apparent. If we substitute \\(w^{i}+g^{i}\\) for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index for each \\(i\\), we then keep track of how many vertices are colored white and how many are colored gold. The simplification of the cycle index in this case is then a generating function in which the coefficient on \\(g^{s}w^{t}\\) is the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of the square with \\(s\\) vertices colored gold and \\(t\\) vertices colored white. Doing this and simplifying gives\n\\[P_{D_{8}}(w+g,w^{2}+g^{2},w^{3}+g^{3},w^{4}+g^{4})=g^{4}+g^{3}w+2g^{2}w^{2}+gw ^{3}+w^{4}.\\]\nFrom this we find one coloring with all vertices gold, one coloring with all vertices white, one coloring with three gold vertices and one white vertex, one coloring with one gold vertex and three white vertices, and two colorings with two vertices of each color.\nAs with the other results we've discovered in this chapter, this property of the cycle index holds up beyond the case of coloring the vertices of the square with two colors. The full version is Polya's enumeration theorem:\n**Theorem 15.11** (Polya's Enumeration Theorem).: _Let \\(S\\) be a set with \\(|S|=r\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) the set of colorings of \\(S\\) using the colors \\(c_{1},\\ldots,c_{m}\\). If a permutation group \\(G\\) acts on \\(S\\) to induce an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then_\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 12.4 Brooks' Theorem\nWhat happens if we try to 3-color a graph in the same way we 2-colored a graph? Without loss of generality, fix three of the vertices in the left-most triangle to be Red, Blue, and Green. How many ways can we try to continue this coloring?\nR = Red, B = Blue, G = Green\nThe number of options to try explodes!\n**Remark 12.4.1**.: One example application of coloring graphs is to scheduling. Suppose for example that you are the math department chair, with a collection of math classes that need to be taught. The times for these classes are already fixed. What is the minimum number of instructors you need to hire?\nYou can solve this problem by building a graph with a vertex for each math class, and by adding an edge between two vertices if the corresponding classes overlap in time. The minimum number of colors needed to color this graph is the same as the minimum possible number of instructors you need to hire.\nSee Problem #4 in Section 12.7 for another example scheduling application.\n**Remark 12.4.2**.: Deciding if a graph with \\(n\\) vertices is 3-colorable in general takes running time \\(\\approx 2^{n/2}\\). This is expensive. Nothing substantially better is known for \\(k\\)-colorings for any \\(k\\geq 3\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 15.1 Coloring the Vertices of a Square\nLet's begin by coloring the vertices of a square using white and gold. If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\).

Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 12.4 Brooks' Theorem\nWhat happens if we try to 3-color a graph in the same way we 2-colored a graph? Without loss of generality, fix three of the vertices in the left-most triangle to be Red, Blue, and Green. How many ways can we try to continue this coloring?\nR = Red, B = Blue, G = Green\nThe number of options to try explodes!\n**Remark 12.4.1**.: One example application of coloring graphs is to scheduling. Suppose for example that you are the math department chair, with a collection of math classes that need to be taught. The times for these classes are already fixed. What is the minimum number of instructors you need to hire?\nYou can solve this problem by building a graph with a vertex for each math class, and by adding an edge between two vertices if the corresponding classes overlap in time. The minimum number of colors needed to color this graph is the same as the minimum possible number of instructors you need to hire.\nSee Problem #4 in Section 12.7 for another example scheduling application.\n**Remark 12.4.2**.: Deciding if a graph with \\(n\\) vertices is 3-colorable in general takes running time \\(\\approx 2^{n/2}\\). This is expensive. Nothing substantially better is known for \\(k\\)-colorings for any \\(k\\geq 3\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n**Ramsey's theorem** says that the Ramsey number \\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is always finite; that is, there does exist some sufficiently large \\(n\\) for which the statement is true. But what is the minimum such number \\(n=R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\)? This is in general an unsolved problem, and the study of computing the Ramsey numbers is called _Ramsey theory_, and is one of a large class of optimization problems in graph theory involving coloring graphs.\n### Exercises\n1.

Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n\n\n",

By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons.

Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons.

What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors.
