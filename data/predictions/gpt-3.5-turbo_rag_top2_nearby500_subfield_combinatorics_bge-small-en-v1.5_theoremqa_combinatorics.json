        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to divide a set of 8 elements into 5 non-empty ordered subsets?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.3.3**.: To write down a permutation of the set \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}\\), we use sequence notation rather than string notation, since 10 has two digits. One possible permutation is:\n\\[(3,6,7,2,1,10,4,5,9,8).\\]\nRecall that \\(n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\), and we pronounce the symbol \\(n!\\) as \"\\(n\\) factorial\".\n**Theorem 3.3.4**.: _The number of permutations of \\(n\\) objects is \\(n!\\)._\nProof.: By Theorem 3.2.9, there are \\(n\\) choices for the first object, then \\(n-1\\) choices for the second object, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on until there is only one 1 choice remaining for the \\(n\\)th object. So there are \\(n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=n!\\) permutations in total.\n**Remark 3.3.5**.: If there are 0 objects, then there is only one way to arrange them (do nothing). This can be thought of as the \"empty sequence\" or \"empty string\". Therefore, we set \\(0!=1\\).\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of ordered subsets of size \\(k\\) from a set with \\(n\\) elements is_\n\\[n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\] (3.1)\n_More generally, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: An ordered subset of size \\(k\\) is a sequence of length \\(k\\) chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) in which no two entries are equal. There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\n\n",

The number of ways we can do this is\n\\[\\binom{11}{4,1,2,4}=\\frac{11!}{4!1!2!4!}=34650.\\]\nIn the next remark, we compare anagrams with ordered set partitions. We will use this to prove Theorem 4.5.7.\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n2. This is a set partition since the blocks of students are not assigned to different days of the week. There are \\(4!\\) ways to order the \\(4\\) blocks. So we divide the answer to part (1) by \\(4!\\).\nAs a final application, we see what happens if we take a power of a sum of more than two variables. The answer to this question is why the expression \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{n}}\\) is often called a _multinomial coefficient_.\n**Example 4.6.8**.: The third power of \\(x+y+z\\) is\n\\[(x+y+z)^{3}=x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+3x^{2}y+3xy^{2}+3x^{2}z+3xz^{2}+3y^{2}z+3yz^{2}+ 6xyz.\\]\nThe coefficients of this expansion are all examples of multinomial coefficients.\nHere is the **Multinomial Theorem**, which directly generalizes the Binomial Theorem from Theorem 4.2.2.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nEach bag can be written using six stones and four sticks. There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to arrange 6 pairs of parentheses such that they are balanced?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nProof.: It is important to note that Assigner does not need to know the value \\(h\\) in advance. For example, Builder may have in mind that ultimately the value of \\(h\\) will be \\(300\\), but this information does not impact Assigner's strategy.\nWhen the new point \\(x_{n}\\) enters \\(P\\), Assigner computes the values \\(r\\) and \\(s\\), where \\(r\\) is the largest integer for which there exists a chain \\(C\\) of \\(r\\) points in \\(\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}\\) having \\(x_{n}\\) as its least element. Also, \\(s\\) is the largest integer for which there exists a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points in \\(\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}\\) having \\(x_{n}\\) as its largest element. Assigner then places \\(x\\) in a set \\(A(r,s)\\), claiming that any two points in this set are incomparable. To see that this claim is valid, consider the first moment where Builder has presented a new point \\(x\\), Assigner places \\(x\\) in \\(A(r,s)\\) and there is already a point \\(y\\) in \\(A(r,s)\\) for which \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are comparable.\nWhen \\(y\\) was presented, there was at that moment in time a chain \\(C^{\\prime}\\) of \\(r\\) points having \\(y\\) as its least element. Also, there was a chain \\(D\\) of \\(s\\) points having \\(y\\) as its greatest element.\nNow suppose that \\(y>x\\) in \\(P\\). Then we can add \\(x\\) to \\(C^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(r+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its least element. This would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned in \\(A(r,s)\\). Similarly, if \\(y<x\\) in \\(P\\), then we may add \\(x\\) to \\(D^{\\prime}\\) to form a chain of \\(s+1\\) points having \\(x\\) as its greatest element. Again, this would imply that \\(x\\) is not assigned to \\(A(r,s)\\).\nSo Assigner has indeed devised a good strategy for partitioning \\(P\\) into antichains, but how many antichains has she used? This is just asking how many ordered pairs \\((i,j)\\) of positive integers are there subject to the restriction that \\(i+j-1\\leq h\\). And we learned how to solve this kind of question in Chapter 2. The answer of course is \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\).\nThe strategy for Assigner is so simple and natural, it might be the case that a more complex strategy would yield a more efficient partitioning. Not so.\n**Theorem 16.5** (Szemeredi).: _For every \\(h\\geq 1\\), there is a strategy \\(S_{h}\\) for builder that will enable him to build a poset \\(P\\) of height \\(h\\) so that assigner is forced to (1) use at least \\(\\binom{h+1}{2}\\) antichains in partitioning \\(P\\), and (2) use at least \\(h\\) different antichains on the set of maximal elements._\nProof.: Strategy \\(S_{1}\\) is just to present a single point. Now suppose that the theorem holds for some integer \\(h\\geq 1\\). We show how strategy \\(S_{h+1}\\) proceeds.\nFirst Builder follows strategy \\(S_{h}\\) to form a poset \\(P_{1}\\). Then he follows it a second time for form a poset \\(P_{2}\\), with all points of \\(P_{1}\\) incomparable to all points in \\(P_{2}\\). Now we consider two cases. Suppose first that Assigner has used \\(h+1\\) or more antichains on the set of maximal elements of \\(P_{1}\\cup P_{2}\\). In this case, he follows strategy \\(S_{h}\\) a third time to build a poset \\(P_{3}\\) with all points of \\(P_{3}\\) less than all maximal elements of \\(P_{1}\\cup P_{2}\\) and incomparable with all other points.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nSolution.Both sides count the number of \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\)-strings of length \\(n\\), the right hand side first partitioning them according to positions in the string which are not \\(2\\). (For instance, if \\(6\\) of the positions are not \\(2\\), we must first choose those \\(6\\) positions in \\(C(n,6)\\) ways and then there are \\(2^{6}\\) ways to fill in those six positions by choosing either a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\) for each position.)\n**Example 2.20**.: Explain why, for each non-negative integer \\(n\\),\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n}=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{ n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nSolution.Both sides count the number of bit strings of length \\(2n\\) with half the bits being \\(0^{\\prime}\\)s, with the right side first partitioning them according to the number of \\(1^{\\prime}\\)s occurring in the first \\(n\\) positions of the string. Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\nImagine the folders placed in a row. Then there are \\(17\\) gaps between them. Of these gaps, choose three and place a divider in each. Then this choice divides the folders into four non-empty sets. The first goes to Audrey, the second to Bart, etc. Thus the answer is \\(C(17,3)\\). In Figure 2.22, we illustrate this scheme with Audrey receiving \\(6\\) folders, Bart getting \\(1\\), Cecilia \\(4\\) and Darren \\(7\\).\n**Example 2.23**.: Suppose we redo the preceding problem but drop the restriction that each of the four employees gets at least one folder. Now how many ways can the distribution be made?\nFigure 2.22: Distributing Identical Objects into Distinct Cells\nSolution.The solution involves a \"trick\" of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by _artificially_ inflating everyone's allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get 7 folders, we say that he will get 8. Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by 4, one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of \\(22=18+4\\) folders. Again, choose 3 gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less--and may be zero. So the answer is \\(C(21,3)\\).\n**Example 2.24**.: Again we have the same problem as before, but now we want to count the number of distributions where only Audrey and Cecilia are guaranteed to get a folder. Bart and Darren are allowed to get zero folders. Now the trick is to artificially inflate Bart and Darren's allocation, but leave the numbers for Audrey and Cecilia as is. So the answer is \\(C(19,3)\\).\n**Example 2.25**.: Here is a reformulation of the preceding discussion expressed in terms of integer solutions of inequalities.\n\n\n",

All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

By the inductive assumption we can color what remains. Since \\(v\\) has at most \\(d\\) neighbors, there is at least one free color out of the \\((d+1)\\)-colors we can use to color \\(v\\) compatibly. Hence we are done by induction.\nBelow is a picture in the case when \\(d=3\\).\n_Aside._ Furthermore, a graph in which every vertex has degree at most \\(d\\) is \\(d\\)-colorable unless\n* \\(d=2\\) and some connected component is an odd cycle, or\n* \\(d>2\\) and some connected component is \\(K_{d+1}\\).\nThe proof of this aside is very hard!\n**Exercise.** Show the following graph is not \\(3\\)-colorable.\n**Remark 12.4.4**.: Sadly there is no \\(K_{4}\\) in this graph, because then we'd be done immediately.\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction that this graph were \\(3\\)-colorable. Without loss of generality let vertex \\(1\\) be Red. Then vertices \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) are Blue and Green or Green and Blue, which implies \\(6\\) is Red. Also vertices \\(4\\) and \\(5\\) are Blue and Green or Green and Blue, which implies \\(7\\) is Red. This is a contradiction since \\(6\\) and \\(7\\) are adjacent! Hence this graph is not \\(3\\)-colorable.\n**Exercise.** Show the following graph is not \\(3\\)-colorable.\nIn the following solution, we will call the inner vertex \\(P\\) the _central vertex_, and the other vertices are in five pairs of _twins_: \\(A_{1}\\) and \\(A_{2}\\) are twins, \\(B_{1}\\) and \\(B_{2}\\) are twins, and so on. In its pair, \\(A_{1}\\) is called the _outer twin_ and \\(A_{2}\\) is called the _inner twin_ (and similarly for all other twin pairs).\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction this graph were 3-colorable. Without loss of generality let the central vertex be Red. So all 5 inner vertices are Blue or Green. A way of coloring the vertices that agrees with this choice is shown below (but naturally is not a 3-coloring - we will just pretend that it is a valid coloring as an illustration).\nWe will show that, if this coloring is a valid 3-coloring, then we can use it to produce a valid 2-coloring of the outer 5-cycle (but _not_ of the entire graph) as follows: if any outer twin is colored Red, replace Red with the color of its inner twin (Blue or Green). Then in this coloring of the outer cycle with Blue and Green, if an outer twin \\(v\\) is changed from Red to Blue (for example), then both of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins must be Green. Indeed, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been Blue since they are each connected to \\(v\\)'s inner twin which is Blue. Also, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been changed from Red (to any other color) since \\(v\\) was originally Red.\nBut this is a contradiction--no odd cycle can be 2-colored. Hence the original graph must not be 3-colorable.\n### Exercises\n1. Brook's Theorem guarantees that \\(G\\) is \\(k\\)-colorable for some \\(k\\), but \\(k\\) might be larger than the chromatic number \\(C(G)\\).

These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right. Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n**Example 5.6.11**.: If 17 people are seated in a circle of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 6 chairs are filled with people.\n_Answer._ The 3 empty chairs partition the circle into \\(n=3\\) \"boxes\" of consecutively filled chairs. Let \\(k+1=6\\), so \\(k=5\\). Since \\(17>15=5\\cdot 3=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=6\\) objects, which are consecutively filled chairs.\nOne of the most fun applications of the pigeonhole principle is to _Ramsey theory_. Here we give one example of this.\n**Example 5.6.12**.: Consider the complete graph \\(K_{6}\\) with 6 vertices (every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge). If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n### Exercises\n1. _Counting Rocks!_ If 5 people pick up 11 rocks in total, show that someone picked up at least 3.\n2. _Counting Socks!_ If a drawer contains 16 black and 16 white socks, how many do you need to pick in order to have a matching pair?\n3.

Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.

And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition.

And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n**Definition 10.4.9**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(k\\) colors \\(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{k}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n\n\n",

A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other.

The coefficient of \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) is the multinomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}\\). In other words,_\n\\[(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}=\\sum_{k_{1}+\\ldots+k_{m}=n}\\binom{n}{k_{1}, \\cdots,k_{m}}x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}.\\]\nFor example, the term \\(3x^{2}y\\) in the above expansion of \\((x+y+z)^{3}\\) can be written as \\(3x^{2}y^{1}z^{0}\\), which does indeed agree with the multinomial coefficient\n\\[\\binom{3}{2,1,0}=3.\\]\nThe following proof is quite difficult and it is alright for you to come back to it after gaining more experience with proofs.\nProof.: We can count how many ways to obtain the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) by multiplying terms in the expansion as follows. We label the factors of \\((x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}\\) by \\(F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\). (Each factor equals \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m}\\) but we think of them as being different since one of them is first, second, etc). Let \\(S=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}\\) be the set of the \\(n\\) factors. To make the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) in the product, we need to choose the variable \\(x_{1}\\) from \\(k_{1}\\) of the factors, then choose the variable \\(x_{2}\\) from \\(k_{2}\\) of the factors, and so on. This forms an ordered set partition of \\(S\\) with sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\), and so the result follows by Theorem 4.6.3.\n### Exercises\n1.

If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2.

See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 5.7 Additional problems for Chapter 5\n1.

Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9.

For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it.

Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

When they arrive at the ice cream shop, they need to wait in line. Student \\(a\\) argues they should wait in alphabetical order, but student \\(g\\) has a strong opposition to this ordering. This prompts the question: How many different ways are there for them to wait in an ordered line?\nTo solve this kind of problem, we need the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.1**.: A **permutation** of \\(n\\) objects is an ordering or arrangement of all \\(n\\) of them.\nA permutation can be expressed as a sequence or string.\n**Example 3.3.2**.: For example, the set \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\) has 6 permutations:\n\\[abc\\quad acb\\quad bac\\quad cab\\quad cba\\]\n**Example 3.3.3**.: To write down a permutation of the set \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}\\), we use sequence notation rather than string notation, since 10 has two digits. One possible permutation is:\n\\[(3,6,7,2,1,10,4,5,9,8).\\]\nRecall that \\(n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\), and we pronounce the symbol \\(n!\\) as \"\\(n\\) factorial\".\n**Theorem 3.3.4**.: _The number of permutations of \\(n\\) objects is \\(n!\\)._\nProof.: By Theorem 3.2.9, there are \\(n\\) choices for the first object, then \\(n-1\\) choices for the second object, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on until there is only one 1 choice remaining for the \\(n\\)th object. So there are \\(n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=n!\\) permutations in total.\n**Remark 3.3.5**.: If there are 0 objects, then there is only one way to arrange them (do nothing). This can be thought of as the \"empty sequence\" or \"empty string\". Therefore, we set \\(0!=1\\).\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\n\n\n",

Each table must have at least 1 person seated.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 5.7 Additional problems for Chapter 5\n1.

If 30 numbers are chosen from 1 to 82, then show that there is a group of at least 5 of them such that the difference between any two numbers in this group is less than 12.\n5. Suppose that 64 chairs are arranged in a circle. Prove that if 57 people sit in this circle of 64 chairs, then there are at least 9 consecutively filled chairs.\n6. Suppose that 80 chairs are arranged in a _row_. Prove that if 75 people sit in this row of 80 chairs, then there are at least 13 consecutively filled chairs.\n7. 1. Look up the statement of the Well-Ordering Principle. Explain how it is similar to and different from induction. 2. Prove the Well-Ordering principle using only strong induction and the axiom that 0 is smaller than every positive integer, as follows. 1. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the statement that any subset of the natural numbers containing \\(n\\) has a least element.\n2. Prove \\(P(0)\\). 3. Prove that if \\(P(0),P(1),\\ldots,P(n)\\) are all true, then \\(P(n+1)\\) is true.\n8. Let \\(p\\) be a prime. Fermat's Little Theorem states that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), for any positive integer \\(a\\). For example, when \\(p=7\\): then \\(7\\) divides \\(1^{7}-1\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(2^{7}-2\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(3^{7}-3\\); etc. 1. For any \\(a\\geq 2\\), generalize Exercise 12b from Section 4.2 to show \\((x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{a})^{p}\\equiv x_{1}^{p}+\\cdots+x_{a}^{p}\\bmod p\\). 2. Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9. In this problem, we will prove Fermat's Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument. 1. Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

Comparing this with Table 15.2 shows that the generating function is right on.\nBy now the pattern is becoming apparent. If we substitute \\(w^{i}+g^{i}\\) for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index for each \\(i\\), we then keep track of how many vertices are colored white and how many are colored gold. The simplification of the cycle index in this case is then a generating function in which the coefficient on \\(g^{s}w^{t}\\) is the number of distinct colorings of the vertices of the square with \\(s\\) vertices colored gold and \\(t\\) vertices colored white. Doing this and simplifying gives\n\\[P_{D_{8}}(w+g,w^{2}+g^{2},w^{3}+g^{3},w^{4}+g^{4})=g^{4}+g^{3}w+2g^{2}w^{2}+gw ^{3}+w^{4}.\\]\nFrom this we find one coloring with all vertices gold, one coloring with all vertices white, one coloring with three gold vertices and one white vertex, one coloring with one gold vertex and three white vertices, and two colorings with two vertices of each color.\nAs with the other results we've discovered in this chapter, this property of the cycle index holds up beyond the case of coloring the vertices of the square with two colors. The full version is Polya's enumeration theorem:\n**Theorem 15.11** (Polya's Enumeration Theorem).: _Let \\(S\\) be a set with \\(|S|=r\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) the set of colorings of \\(S\\) using the colors \\(c_{1},\\ldots,c_{m}\\). If a permutation group \\(G\\) acts on \\(S\\) to induce an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), then_\n\\[P_{G}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i},\\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i}^{2},\\ldots,\\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_ {i}^{r}\\right)\\]\n_is the generating function for the number of nonequivalent colorings of \\(S\\) in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\)._\nIf we return to coloring the vertices of the square but now allow the color blue as well, we find\n\\[P_{D_{8}}(w+g+b,w^{2}+g^{2}+b^{2},w^{3}+g^{3}+b^{3},w^{4}+g^{4}+b^{4})=b^{4}+b ^{3}g+2b^{2}g^{2}\\]\n\\[+bg^{3}+g^{4}+b^{3}w+2b^{2}gw+2bg^{2}w+g^{3}w+2b^{2}w^{2}+2bgw^{2}+2g^{2 }w^{2}\\] \\[+bw^{3}+gw^{3}+w^{4}.\\]\nFrom this generating function, we can readily determine the number of nonequivalent colorings with two blue vertices, one gold vertex, and one white vertex to be 2. Because the generating function of Polya's Enumeration Theorem records the number of nonequivalent patterns, it is sometimes called the **pattern inventory**.\nWhat if we were interested in making necklaces with 500 (very small) beads colored white, gold, and blue? This would be equivalent to coloring the vertices of a regular 500-gon, and the dihedral group \\(D_{1000}\\) would give the appropriate transformations. With a computer algebra system1 such as _Mathematica(r)_, it is possible to quickly produce the pattern inventory for such a problem.

In Figure 1.1, we show four such necklaces--however, note that the first three are actually the _same_ necklace. Each has three red beads, two blues and one green. On the other hand, the fourth necklace has the same number of beads of each color but it is a _different_ necklace.\n1. How many different necklaces of six beads can be formed using three reds, two blues and one green?\n2. How many different necklaces of six beads can be formed using red, blue and green beads (not all colors have to be used)?\n3. How many different necklaces of six beads can be formed using red, blue and green beads if all three colors have to be used?\n4. How would we possibly answer these questions for necklaces of six thousand beads made with beads from three thousand different colors? What special software would be required to find the exact answer and how long would the computation take?\n### 1.3 Combinatorics and Graph Theory\nA **graph**\\(G\\) consists of a **vertex** set \\(V\\) and a collection \\(E\\) of 2-element subsets of \\(V\\). Elements of \\(E\\) are called **edges**. In our course, we will (almost always) use the convention that \\(V=\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) for some positive integer \\(n\\). With this convention, graphs can be described _precisely_ with a text file:\n1. The first line of the file contains a single integer \\(n\\), the number of vertices in the graph.\n2. Each of the remaining lines of the file contains a pair of distinct integers and specifies an edge of the graph.\nFigure 1.1: Necklaces made with three colors\nWe illustrate this convention in Figure 1.2 with a text file and the diagram for the graph \\(G\\) it defines.\nMuch of the notation and terminology for graphs is quite natural. See if you can make sense out of the following statements which apply to the graph \\(G\\) defined above:\n1. \\(G\\) has 9 vertices and 10 edges.\n2. \\(\\{2,6\\}\\) is an edge.\n3. Vertices 5 and 9 are adjacent.\n4. \\(\\{5,4\\}\\) is not an edge.\n5. Vertices 3 and 7 are not adjacent.\n6. \\(P=(4,3,1,7,9,5)\\) is a path of length 5 from vertex 4 to vertex 5.\n7. \\(C=(5,9,7,1)\\) is cycle of length 4.\n8. \\(G\\) is disconnected and has two components. One of the components has vertex set \\(\\{2,6,8\\}\\).\n9. \\(\\{1,5,7\\}\\) is a triangle.\n10. \\(\\{1,7,5,9\\}\\) is a clique of size 4.\n11. \\(\\{4,2,8,5\\}\\) is an independent set of size 4.\nFigure 1.2: A graph defined by data\nEquipped only with this little bit of background material, we are already able to pose a number of interesting and challenging problems.\n**Example 1.3**.: Consider the graph \\(G\\) shown in Figure 1.4.\n1.

An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\\[\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\mid\\bullet.\\]\nThe first stone indicates that there is one apple, then the next two stones indicates that there are two bananas, and so on. There are no stones between the last two sticks because there are no oranges in the bag.\nEach bag can be written using six stones and four sticks. There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* by writing the multiplicity as a superscript on the element; (This method can sometimes lead to confusion.)\n* by writing down the function \\(f\\).\n**Example 3.5.3**.: Here are several ways to write the multiset with three 4's, one 5, and two 6's:\n* \\(\\{4,4,4,5,6,6\\}\\) or \\(\\{4,5,4,6,4,6\\}\\) (the order does not matter).\n* \\(\\{4^{\\times 3},5^{\\times 1},6^{\\times 2}\\}\\) Warning! The \\(4^{\\times 3}\\) written here does not mean 4 raised to the power \\(\\times 3\\). It means that 4 occurs 3 times in the multiset.\n* The function \\(f:\\{4,5,6\\}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(f(4)=3\\), \\(f(5)=1\\), and \\(f(6)=2\\).\n**Notation 3.5.4**.: The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements are chosen from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is sometimes written \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). We pronounce this symbol \"\\(n\\) multichoose \\(k\\)\" or \"\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\) with repeats\".\n#### Counting multisets with sticks and stones\nTo count the number of multisets of a certain kind, we use what we call the \"sticks and stones\" method. (In other sources, this is sometimes called the \"stars and bars\" method.) We illustrate this method first with an example.\n**Example 3.5.5**.: Suppose we have an unlimited supply of 5 kinds of fruit: apples, bananas, mangoes, oranges, and pears. Let's write them as A, B, M, O, and P for short. How many ways can we make a bag of 6 fruits?\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\\[\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\mid\\bullet.\\]\nThe first stone indicates that there is one apple, then the next two stones indicates that there are two bananas, and so on. There are no stones between the last two sticks because there are no oranges in the bag.\nEach bag can be written using six stones and four sticks. There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts.

To do this, we define a _set partition_, which is a a helpful way to organize sets.\n**Definition 2.9.1**.: Let \\(A\\) be a finite set. A non-empty subset \\(B\\) of \\(A\\) is called a **block**. A **set partition** of a finite set \\(A\\) is a set of blocks \\(\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) of \\(A\\) such that:\n1. the blocks are disjoint, that is, \\(B_{i}\\cap B_{j}=\\emptyset\\) for all \\(i\\neq j\\); and\n2. the union of the blocks is \\(A\\), that is \\(B_{1}\\cup B_{2}\\cup\\cdots\\cup B_{k}=A\\).\n**Example 2.9.2**.: The following is a set partition of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}\\):\n\\[\\{\\{1,3,4\\},\\{2,6\\},\\{5,7\\}\\}.\\]\nThe division principle arises when we split a set into blocks of equal sizes. It can be stated as follows.\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdots k_{m}!}.\\]\nProof.: We count the number of ordered set partitions of a set \\(S\\) of size \\(n\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) as follows. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\). Out of the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements, there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{(n-k_{1})!}{k_{2}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2})}\\) ways to choose the next block \\(B_{2}\\). If \\(m\\geq 3\\), there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}!}=\\frac{(n-k_{1}-k_{2})!}{k_{3}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2}-k_ {3})!}\\) ways to choose the third block \\(B_{3}\\), and so on. Multiplying these together, all the factorials cancel except for \\(n!\\) in the numerator and the terms \\(k_{1}!,\\ldots,k_{m}!\\) in the denominator. The result follows.\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\). The number of ways we can do this is\n\\[\\binom{11}{4,1,2,4}=\\frac{11!}{4!1!2!4!}=34650.\\]\nIn the next remark, we compare anagrams with ordered set partitions. We will use this to prove Theorem 4.5.7.\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n\n\n",

Now for integers \\(m,n\\) with \\(m\\geq n\\geq 0\\) define \\(P(m,n)\\) by\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)\\cdots(m-n+1).\\]\nFor example, \\(P(9,3)=9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7=504\\) and \\(P(8,4)=8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5=1680\\).

After fixing \\(x_{1}\\), we have that for \\(x_{2}\\), there are \\(m-1\\) choices, as we can use any element of \\(X-\\{x_{1}\\}\\). For \\(x_{3}\\), there are \\(m-2\\) choices, since we can use any element in \\(X-\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}\\). For \\(x_{n}\\), there are \\(m-n+1\\) choices, because we can use any element of \\(X\\) except \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots x_{n-1}\\). Noting that\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)(m-2)\\dots(m-n+1),\\]\nour proof is complete.\nNote that the answer we arrived at in Example 2.5 is simply \\(P(26,6)\\) as we would expect in light of Proposition 2.6.\n**Example 2.7**.: It's time to elect a slate of four class officers (President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer) from the pool of 80 students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. If any interested student could be elected to any position (Alice contends this is a big \"if\" since Bob is running), how many different slates of officers can be elected?\nSolution.To count possible officer slates, work from a set \\(X\\) containing the names of the 80 interested students (yes, even poor Bob). A permutation of length four chosen from \\(X\\) is then a slate of officers by considering the first name in the permutation as the President, the second as the Vice President, the third as the Secretary, and the fourth as the Treasurer. Thus, the number of officer slates is \\(P(80,4)=37957920\\).\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\n\n",

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners.

Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n**Definition 10.4.9**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(k\\) colors \\(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{k}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n**Ramsey's theorem** says that the Ramsey number \\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is always finite; that is, there does exist some sufficiently large \\(n\\) for which the statement is true. But what is the minimum such number \\(n=R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\)? This is in general an unsolved problem, and the study of computing the Ramsey numbers is called _Ramsey theory_, and is one of a large class of optimization problems in graph theory involving coloring graphs.\n### Exercises\n1.

If each university van seats 4 people, \\(36/4=9\\) vans are needed to transport the students.\n**Example 2.3.4**.: How many lotto tickets are there, if a lotto ticket is a collection of 5 different numbers from \\(\\{1,\\ldots,90\\}\\), where order does not matter?\nWe already know one way to solve this problem! The number of lotto tickets is the number of ways to choose 5 numbers out of 90. This equals\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

In Section 5.5, we will prove that \\(\\sqrt{3}\\notin\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n**Example 2.5.10**.: In the 1760s, Lambert proved that the real number \\(\\pi\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n**Example 2.5.11**.: There are several ways to describe the set of all even natural numbers:\n\\[\\{x\\in\\mathbb{N}\\mid x\\text{ is even}\\}=\\{0,2,4,6,8,\\ldots\\}=\\{2\\cdot k\\mid k \\in\\mathbb{N}\\}.\\]\n#### Subsets\nInformally, a _subset_ is a set contained in a bigger set.\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\).

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\nwhich there are no restrictions, a factor of \\(e^{7x}\\) is introduced. To account for an even number of \\(0\\)s, he uses \\((e^{x}+e^{-x})/2\\). For at least one \\(1\\), a factor of \\(e^{x}-1\\) is required. Finally, \\(1+x+x^{2}/2!+x^{3}/3!\\) accounts for the restriction of at most three \\(2\\)s. The exponential generating function for the number of \\(n\\)-digit passcodes is thus\n\\[e^{7x}\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}(e^{x}-1)\\left(1+x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3! }\\right).\\]\nDave sees this mess written on the whiteboard and groans. He figures they'll be there all day multiplying and making algebra mistakes in trying to find the desired coefficient. Alice points out that they don't really need to find the coefficient on \\(x^{n}/n!\\) for all \\(n\\). Instead, she suggests they use SageMath to just find the coefficient on \\(x^{8}/8!\\).\n``` f(x)=(exp(7*x)*((exp(x)+exp(-1*x))/(2))*(exp(x)-1)*\\) (1+x+x^2/2+x^3/factorial(3))).series(x,9) f(x).List()[8] ```\n\n\n",

If 30 numbers are chosen from 1 to 82, then show that there is a group of at least 5 of them such that the difference between any two numbers in this group is less than 12.\n5. Suppose that 64 chairs are arranged in a circle. Prove that if 57 people sit in this circle of 64 chairs, then there are at least 9 consecutively filled chairs.\n6. Suppose that 80 chairs are arranged in a _row_. Prove that if 75 people sit in this row of 80 chairs, then there are at least 13 consecutively filled chairs.\n7. 1. Look up the statement of the Well-Ordering Principle. Explain how it is similar to and different from induction. 2. Prove the Well-Ordering principle using only strong induction and the axiom that 0 is smaller than every positive integer, as follows. 1. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the statement that any subset of the natural numbers containing \\(n\\) has a least element.\n2. Prove \\(P(0)\\). 3. Prove that if \\(P(0),P(1),\\ldots,P(n)\\) are all true, then \\(P(n+1)\\) is true.\n8. Let \\(p\\) be a prime. Fermat's Little Theorem states that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), for any positive integer \\(a\\). For example, when \\(p=7\\): then \\(7\\) divides \\(1^{7}-1\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(2^{7}-2\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(3^{7}-3\\); etc. 1. For any \\(a\\geq 2\\), generalize Exercise 12b from Section 4.2 to show \\((x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{a})^{p}\\equiv x_{1}^{p}+\\cdots+x_{a}^{p}\\bmod p\\). 2. Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9. In this problem, we will prove Fermat's Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument. 1. Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\n\n",

To celebrate, the seven students decide to get a large sundae in a bowl, filled with many different scoops of ice cream. There are 10 flavors of ice cream and a large sundae has 15 scoops. Since it is a hot day in Colorado, all of the scoops will melt together, so the order of the scoops does not matter. Each flavor can be used for as many of the 15 scoops as they want. How many different sundaes can student \\(c\\) order?\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.4. To solve problems of this type, we define a _multiset_; intuitively, this is a set whose elements do not need to be different.\n**Example 3.5.1**.: The multiset \\(\\{\\text{apple},\\text{apple},\\text{orange},\\text{pear},\\text{pear}\\}\\) denotes a collection of two identical apples, one orange, and two identical pears.\n**Definition 3.5.2**.: A **multiset** is a set, together with a positive integer multiplicity assigned to each element. Equivalently, it is a set \\(S\\), together with a function \\(f:S\\to\\mathbb{N}-\\{0\\}\\).\nA multiset can be written down in several ways:\n* by listing an element of the set \\(m\\) times if it has multiplicity \\(m\\);\n* by writing the multiplicity as a superscript on the element; (This method can sometimes lead to confusion.)\n* by writing down the function \\(f\\).\n**Example 3.5.3**.: Here are several ways to write the multiset with three 4's, one 5, and two 6's:\n* \\(\\{4,4,4,5,6,6\\}\\) or \\(\\{4,5,4,6,4,6\\}\\) (the order does not matter).\n* \\(\\{4^{\\times 3},5^{\\times 1},6^{\\times 2}\\}\\) Warning! The \\(4^{\\times 3}\\) written here does not mean 4 raised to the power \\(\\times 3\\). It means that 4 occurs 3 times in the multiset.\n* The function \\(f:\\{4,5,6\\}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(f(4)=3\\), \\(f(5)=1\\), and \\(f(6)=2\\).\n**Notation 3.5.4**.: The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements are chosen from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is sometimes written \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). We pronounce this symbol \"\\(n\\) multichoose \\(k\\)\" or \"\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\) with repeats\".\n#### Counting multisets with sticks and stones\nTo count the number of multisets of a certain kind, we use what we call the \"sticks and stones\" method. (In other sources, this is sometimes called the \"stars and bars\" method.) We illustrate this method first with an example.\n**Example 3.5.5**.: Suppose we have an unlimited supply of 5 kinds of fruit: apples, bananas, mangoes, oranges, and pears. Let's write them as A, B, M, O, and P for short. How many ways can we make a bag of 6 fruits?\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. Suppose that he does this by selecting a specific type of donut for each person.

As before we assume that we have constructed for some \\(t\\geq 3\\) a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t})=2\\) and \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t})=t\\). Again, label the vertices of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n_{t}}\\). To construct \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\), we now start with an independent set \\(I\\), but now \\(I\\) has only \\(n_{t}\\) points, which we label as \\(y_{1},y_{2},\\ldots,y_{n_{t}}\\). We then add a copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with \\(y_{i}\\) adjacent to \\(x_{j}\\) if and only if \\(x_{i}\\) is adjacent to \\(x_{j}\\). Finally, attach a new vertex \\(z\\) adjacent to all vertices in \\(I\\).\nClearly, \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=2\\). Also, \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})\\geq t\\), since it contains \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) as a subgraph. Furthermore, \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})\\leq t+1\\), since we can color \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with colors from \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,t\\}\\), use color \\(t+1\\) on the independent set \\(I\\), and then assign color \\(1\\) to the new vertex \\(z\\). We claim that in fact \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t+1\\). Suppose not. Then we must have \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t\\). Let \\(\\phi\\) be a proper\ncoloring of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1}\\). Without loss of generality, \\(\\phi\\) uses the colors in \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,t\\}\\) and \\(\\phi\\) assigns color \\(t\\) to \\(z\\). Then consider the nonempty set \\(S\\) of vertices in the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) to which \\(\\phi\\) assigns color \\(t\\). For each \\(x_{i}\\) in \\(S\\), change the color on \\(x_{i}\\) so that it matches the color assigned to \\(y_{i}\\) by \\(\\phi\\), which cannot be \\(t\\), as \\(z\\) is colored \\(t\\). What results is a proper coloring of the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\) with only \\(t-1\\) colors since \\(x_{i}\\) and \\(y_{i}\\) are adjacent to the same vertices of the copy of \\(\\mathbf{G}_{t}\\). The contradiction shows that \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G}_{t+1})=t+1\\), as claimed.\nSince a 3-clique looks like a triangle, Proposition 5.25 is often stated as \"There exist triangle-free graphs with large chromatic number.\" As an illustration of the construction in the proof of Mycielski, we again refer to Figure 5.19. The graph shown is \\(\\mathbf{G}_{4}\\). We will return to the topic of graphs with large chromatic number in Section 11.6 where we show that are there graphs with large chromatic number which lack not only cliques of more than two vertices but also _cycles_ of fewer than \\(g\\) vertices for _any_ value of \\(g\\). In other words, there is a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) with \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})=10^{6}\\) but no cycle with fewer than \\(10^{10}\\) vertices!\n#### Can We Determine Chromatic Number?\nSuppose you are given a graph \\(\\mathbf{G}\\). It's starting to look like it is not easy to find an algorithm that answers the question \"Is \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})\\leq t\\)?\" It's easy to verify a certificate (a proper coloring using at most \\(t\\) colors), but how could you even find a proper coloring, not to mention one with the fewest number of colors? Similarly for the question \"Is \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\geq k\\)?\", it is easy to verify a certificate. However, finding a maximum clique appears to be a very hard problem. Of course, since the gap between \\(\\chi(\\mathbf{G})\\) and \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{G})\\) can be arbitrarily large, being able to find one value would not (generally) help in finding the value of the other. No polynomial-time algorithm is known for either of these problems, and many believe that no such algorithm exists. In this subsection, we look at one approach to finding chromatic number and see a case where it does work efficiently.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n**Definition 10.4.9**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(k\\) colors \\(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{k}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n\n\n",

And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe coefficients of this expansion are all examples of multinomial coefficients.\nHere is the **Multinomial Theorem**, which directly generalizes the Binomial Theorem from Theorem 4.2.2.\n**Theorem 4.6.9**.: _Consider the expansion of \\((x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}\\). The coefficient of \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) is the multinomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}\\). In other words,_\n\\[(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}=\\sum_{k_{1}+\\ldots+k_{m}=n}\\binom{n}{k_{1}, \\cdots,k_{m}}x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}.\\]\nFor example, the term \\(3x^{2}y\\) in the above expansion of \\((x+y+z)^{3}\\) can be written as \\(3x^{2}y^{1}z^{0}\\), which does indeed agree with the multinomial coefficient\n\\[\\binom{3}{2,1,0}=3.\\]\nThe following proof is quite difficult and it is alright for you to come back to it after gaining more experience with proofs.\nProof.: We can count how many ways to obtain the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) by multiplying terms in the expansion as follows. We label the factors of \\((x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}\\) by \\(F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\). (Each factor equals \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m}\\) but we think of them as being different since one of them is first, second, etc). Let \\(S=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}\\) be the set of the \\(n\\) factors. To make the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) in the product, we need to choose the variable \\(x_{1}\\) from \\(k_{1}\\) of the factors, then choose the variable \\(x_{2}\\) from \\(k_{2}\\) of the factors, and so on. This forms an ordered set partition of \\(S\\) with sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\), and so the result follows by Theorem 4.6.3.\n### Exercises\n1.

They read the first problem that they were assigned.\nFootnote 1: To protect their privacy, students are identified by their first initial in this book.\n**Question 2.1.1**.: How many ways are there to choose 6 numbers from the set \\(\\{1,\\ldots,20\\}\\) so that at least four of them are odd?\nStudent \\(d\\) watched as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) each worked on the problem for several minutes, using paper, calculators, and tablets. Finally, student \\(d\\) said 'Hey, I don't know how to get started with this.'\n**Student \\(a\\)**: My thought is there are 10 odd numbers between 1 and 20. So there are 10 choices for the first odd number, 9 choices for the second, 8 choices for the third, and 7 choices for the fourth. The last two numbers can be odd or even and there are 16 numbers left. So that gives 16 choices for the fifth and 15 choices for the sixth. So the answer is\n\\[10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 16\\cdot 15=1,209,600.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: You're forgetting that the order doesn't matter. So first we need to choose four numbers out of the 10 odd numbers, then we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 16 numbers. So the answer is\n\\[\\binom{10}{4}\\cdot\\binom{16}{2}=\\frac{10!}{4!6!}\\cdot\\frac{16!}{2!14!}=25,200.\\]\n**Student \\(c\\)**: I have a different way of doing it. There are \\(\\binom{20}{6}\\) ways to choose six integers out of the 20, but the probability that a number is odd is \\(1/2\\). So the answer is\n\\[\\binom{20}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{4}}=\\frac{20!}{6!14!}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2^{4}}=2422.5.\\]\nWait, that's not an integer....\n**Student \\(d\\)**: What if there are more than four odd numbers? Forget this, let's try the next question.\n**Question 2.1.2**.: In a game of poker, you are dealt five cards from a standard 52 card deck. How many ways can you be dealt a full house?\n**Student \\(c\\)**: I've never played cards. What is a full house?2\nFootnote 2: If you are not familiar with cards or poker, there is a lot of helpful information in Section 3.8.\n**Student \\(a\\)**: It's a triple of the same number together with a pair of a different number. Like 6 of hearts, 6 of clubs, and 6 of diamonds, together with 3 of hearts and 3 of spades. So I'm thinking for the first card, we have 52 choices; no matter what number it is, to get a triple we need to choose two more out of the three remaining cards of that number, and there are three ways to do that. Then there are 48 choices for the next card; no matter what number it is, to get a pair we need to choose one more out of the three remaining cards of that number, and there are three ways to do that. So the answer is:\n\\[52\\cdot 3\\cdot 48\\cdot 3=22464.\\]\n**Student \\(b\\)**: That's over counting again because it doesn't matter which card is dealt first. Instead, let's choose two numbers out of 13, then choose three suits for the first number and then choose two suits for the second number. So the answer is:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

(Later, we might also choose to weight the edge by the number of pizzas ordered from that parlor over the last month.)\nThis graph has a particular structure: there are no edges between two pizza parlors, since a pizza parlor never orders pizza from another parlor; similarly, there are no edges between two houses, since no house ever orders pizza from another house!\nMany problems in graph theory involve matching two different types of objects, like students with jobs, or pets with owners.\n**Definition 8.2.8**.: A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) is **bipartite** if \\(V\\) is the disjoint union of two sets \\(L\\) (left) and \\(R\\) (right) and every edge connects a vertex in \\(L\\) with a vertex in \\(R\\).\nIn other words, there are no edges between two vertices in \\(L\\) and no edges between two vertices in \\(R\\).\nFigure 8.6: Bipartite graph with three vertices on the left corresponding to pizza parlors, and four vertices on the right corresponding to houses. An edge represents an order between that house and that parlor in the last month.\n**Definition 8.2.9**.: The **complete bipartite graph**\\(B_{n,m}\\) is the bipartite graph with \\(n\\) vertices on the left and \\(m\\) vertices on the right, such that every vertex on the left is adjacent to every vertex on the right.\nIn the example with three pizza parlors and four student houses, the complete bipartite graph \\(B_{3,4}\\) would model the situation in which all four houses have ordered pizza from all three parlors within the last month.\n#### Exercises\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute \\(C(n,k)\\) in general.\n**Proposition 2.9**.: _If \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are integers with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\), then_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=C(n,k)=\\frac{P(n,k)}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\]\nProof.: If \\(X\\) is an \\(n\\)-element set, then \\(P(n,k)\\) counts the number of \\(X\\)-permutations of length \\(k\\). Each of the \\(C(n,k)\\)\\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) can be turned into \\(k!\\) permutations, and this accounts for each permutation exactly once. Therefore, \\(k!C(n,k)=P(n,k)\\) and dividing by \\(k!\\) gives the formula for the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets.\nUsing Proposition 2.9, we can now determine that \\(C(80,4)=1581580\\) is the number of ways a four-member executive council could be elected from the 80 interested students.\nOur argument above illustrates a common combinatorial counting strategy. We counted one thing and determined that the objects we wanted to count were _over-counted_ the same number of times each, so we divided by that number (\\(k!\\) in this case).\nThe following result is tantamount to saying that choosing elements to belong to a set (the executive council election winners) is the same as choosing those elements which are to be denied membership (the election losers).\n**Proposition 2.10**.: _For all integers \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\),_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}.\\]\n**Example 2.11**.: A Southern restaurant lists 21 items in the \"vegetable\" category of its menu. (Like any good Southern restaurant, macaroni and cheese is _one_ of the vegetable options.) They sell a vegetable plate which gives the customer four different vegetables from the menu. Since there is no importance to the order the vegetables are placed on the plate, there are \\(C(21,4)=5985\\) different ways for a customer to order a vegetable plate at the restaurant.\nOur next example introduces an important correspondence between sets and bit strings that we will repeatedly exploit in this text.\n**Example 2.12**.: Let \\(n\\) be a positive integer and let \\(X\\) be an \\(n\\)-element set. Then there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between subsets of \\(X\\) and bit strings of length \\(n\\). To be precise, let \\(X=\\{x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}\\). Then a subset \\(A\\subseteq X\\) corresponds to the string \\(s\\) where \\(s(i)=1\\) if and only if \\(i\\in A\\). For example, if \\(X=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\\}\\), then the subset \\(\\{b,c,g\\}\\) corresponds to the bit string \\(01100010\\). There are \\(C(8,3)=56\\) bit strings of length eight with precisely three 1's. Thinking about this correspondence, what is the total number of subsets of an \\(n\\)-element set?\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nIn how many ways can a set of 6 distinct letters be partitioned into 2 non-empty groups if each group must contain at least 2 letters?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nEach bag can be written using six stones and four sticks. There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nto denote the infinite sequence whose \\(i\\)th entry is \\(a_{i}\\) for each integer \\(i\\geq 1\\).\nThe set of numbers or symbols we use in a sequence is called the _alphabet_. Commonly used alphabets are the binary alphabet \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), the letters in the English alphabet, ASCII, or the natural numbers.\nThe next remark explains some other variations on sequences.\n**Remark 3.2.3**.:\n1. It is sometimes convenient to \"zero-index\", by starting a sequence with \\(a_{0}\\) rather than \\(a_{1}\\), see Chapter 6.\n2. It is sometimes convenient to write a sequence as a _string_ or _word_, in which we drop the parentheses and commas. For instance, the sequence \\((a,p,p,l,e)\\) can be more easily written as the string of letters \\(apple\\), and the string of digits \\((1,0,1,1,0)\\) can be written as the binary string \\(10110\\). _Warning:_ We do not want to write the sequence \\((1,0,10,100,1000)\\) as the string \\(10101001000\\), because we would lose information about the length of each entry. This topic is important in coding theory where it is called the theory of uniquely decipherable codes.\n3. A sequence of length \\(n\\) can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\). An infinite sequence can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer.\n#### Counting where order matters and repeats are allowed\nThe type of counting seen in Example 3.1.3, where **order matters** and **repeats are allowed**, can be restated in terms of counting sequences. Indeed, if we choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects in order, with repeats allowed, we can write them as a sequence from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols.\nWe can count such sequences as follows.\n**Theorem 3.2.4**.: _The number of sequences of length \\(k\\) composed from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols is \\(n^{k}\\). More generally, there are \\(n^{k}\\) combinations of \\(k\\) objects chosen from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: There are \\(n\\) ways to choose the first symbol in the sequence, then \\(n\\) ways to choose the second, and so on up to the \\(k\\)th. Therefore there are \\(n\\cdot n\\cdot n\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot n=n^{k}\\) possibilities.\nUsing Theorem 3.2.4, we can complete the general formula for one entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order does not matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & & \\\\ Repeats allowed & & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\nLet's look at a few examples; for convenience we write these examples as strings.\n**Example 3.2.5**.: The number of binary strings (consisting of 0's and 1's) of length \\(k\\) is \\(2^{k}\\) (here \\(n=2\\)). We can verify this for \\(k=3\\) by listing all \\(8=2^{3}\\) possible binary strings of length three:\n\\[000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111.\\]\n**Example 3.2.6**.: The number of strings of three letters from the English alphabet is \\((26)^{3}=17,576\\). Some examples are \\(pxy\\) or \\(csu\\).\n**Example 3.2.7**.: The number of strings of three letters or numbers, such as \\(p17\\), \\(2xy\\), or \\(pqm\\), is \\((26+10)^{3}=36^{3}=46,656\\).\n\n\n",

Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n**Example 5.6.11**.: If 17 people are seated in a circle of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 6 chairs are filled with people.\n_Answer._ The 3 empty chairs partition the circle into \\(n=3\\) \"boxes\" of consecutively filled chairs.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to divide a set of 5 elements into 2 non-empty ordered subsets?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n#### Subsets\nInformally, a _subset_ is a set contained in a bigger set.\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different different bouquets of 10 balloons are there that contain at least one balloon of each color? In this case, \\(m=10\\) and \\(n=6\\). Hence the number of ways is \\(\\binom{10-1}{6-1}=\\binom{9}{5}\\).\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\n\n",

The number of lotto tickets is the number of ways to choose 5 numbers out of 90. This equals\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

In how many ways can you attach the letters of MATH in some order to a piece of string? (If you turn the string over so that the order of the letters is reversed, it is not considered a different possibility. So for instance, MATH and HTAM are considered the same ordering.)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 10.4.3**.: Suppose a graph \\(G\\) has every edge assigned a color. A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\n\n",

To properly distinguish one region from another, it is crucial to utilize a different color for territories sharing a common border. After making many maps for various royal affairs, you begin to question the coloring of your maps. How many colors are needed to color planar maps in a satisfactory way? The below map can be colored with four colors.\nColoring maps can be related to coloring planar graphs. Indeed, below we show how to turn this map into a planar graph, and how a valid coloring of this map translates into a vertex coloring of the corresponding planar graph. To form the graph, add a vertex for each region, and add an edge between two vertices if the corresponding regions are adjacent. A valid coloring of the map, with no adjacent regions of the same color, corresponds to a vertex coloring of the graph, meaning that no adjacent vertices have the same color.\nLet us explain why this map requires at least 4 colors, in order for adjacent regions to have different colors. Suppose for a contradiction 3 colors sufficed. Without loss of generality, color the region 'N' red, color the region 'C' blue, and color the region 'O' green. Then necessarily the region 'I' must be blue, as it is already adjacent to green and red regions, and we have only three colors at our disposal. And similarly, the region 'U' must now necessarily be green. There is now no valid color for region 'A', as it is already adjacent to regions labeled blue, red, and green. Hence at least 4 colors are needed to color this map!\nBelow is a smaller map that requires 4 colors so that adjacent regions are not of the same color. Indeed, the planar graph corresponding to this map is \\(K_{4}\\), the complete graph on four vertices, which requires at least 4 colors.\nAfter successfully coloring many large maps with only four colors, our cartographer begins to wonder if _all_ planar maps can be colored with four colors. This is true and is now called the four-color theorem; it states that any map drawn on the plane or the surface of a sphere can be colored using four colors in such a way that areas with a common boundary are not the same color.\n**Theorem 12.7.1** (Four color theorem).: _Every planar map can be colored with only 4 colors, so that adjacent regions (sharing a boundary of positive length) have different colors._\nThe history of the four color theorem is quite interesting. The question \"Can every planar map be 4-colored\" was first raised by Francis Guthrie in England in 1852. In 1879, Alfred Kempe published an incorrect proof, which for a decade was regarded as correct before the error was found! Indeed, in 1886 the problem of showing that any planar map can be 4-colored was posed to the students of Clifton College,\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.5.16**.: The number of ways to distribute \\(m=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people so that each person gets at least one is \\(\\binom{9-1}{4-1}=\\binom{8}{3}=56\\).\n**Example 3.5.17**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 positive integers have sum equal to 9?

This matches the problem in Example 3.5.13 and is therefore 56.\n### Exercises\n1. In each of the questions below, there are 7 types of sushi (each costing 1 dollar). 1.

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

In how many ways can you attach the letters of MATH in some order to a piece of string? (If you turn the string over so that the order of the letters is reversed, it is not considered a different possibility. So for instance, MATH and HTAM are considered the same ordering.)\n4. There are 10 people in a dance class. How many ways can they pair off into 5 pairs of dance partners? (Gender does not matter in making the pairings.)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\). The number of ways we can do this is\n\\[\\binom{11}{4,1,2,4}=\\frac{11!}{4!1!2!4!}=34650.\\]\nIn the next remark, we compare anagrams with ordered set partitions. We will use this to prove Theorem 4.5.7.\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n2. This is a set partition since the blocks of students are not assigned to different days of the week. There are \\(4!\\) ways to order the \\(4\\) blocks. So we divide the answer to part (1) by \\(4!\\).\nAs a final application, we see what happens if we take a power of a sum of more than two variables. The answer to this question is why the expression \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{n}}\\) is often called a _multinomial coefficient_.\n**Example 4.6.8**.: The third power of \\(x+y+z\\) is\n\\[(x+y+z)^{3}=x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+3x^{2}y+3xy^{2}+3x^{2}z+3xz^{2}+3y^{2}z+3yz^{2}+ 6xyz.\\]\nThe coefficients of this expansion are all examples of multinomial coefficients.\n\n\n",

Look up the statement of the Well-Ordering Principle. Explain how it is similar to and different from induction. 2. Prove the Well-Ordering principle using only strong induction and the axiom that 0 is smaller than every positive integer, as follows. 1. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the statement that any subset of the natural numbers containing \\(n\\) has a least element.\n2. Prove \\(P(0)\\). 3. Prove that if \\(P(0),P(1),\\ldots,P(n)\\) are all true, then \\(P(n+1)\\) is true.\n8. Let \\(p\\) be a prime.

Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\n\n",

One very famous such object is called a _partition_. The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n#### Fun with infinite products\nIn the video above, it was shown informally that the generating function for the partition numbers \\(p(n)\\) has the infinite product formula:\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}p(n)x^{n}=\\frac{1}{(1-x)}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(1-x^{2})}\\cdot\\frac {1}{(1-x^{3})}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(1-x^{4})}\\cdots.\\]\nWe now explore infinite products of generating functions in more rigorous detail.\n**Definition 7.8.6**.: Let \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x),\\ldots\\) be an infinite collection of generating functions. We say that the infinite product\n\\[\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}F_{n}(x)=F_{1}(x)F_{2}(x)F_{3}(x)\\cdots\\]\n**converges to \\(G(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}b_{i}x^{i}\\)**, if the partial products\n\\[P_{m}(x)=\\prod_{n=0}^{m}F_{n}(x)=F_{1}(x)F_{2}(x)\\cdots F_{m}(x)\\]\nhave coefficients that eventually match those of \\(G(x)\\). This means that for all \\(i\\), there is some positive integer \\(N\\) such that if \\(m>N\\), the coefficient of \\(x^{i}\\) in \\(P_{m}(x)\\) equals \\(b_{i}\\).\nIf the product converges to \\(G(x)\\), we simply say that the infinite product is **equal** to \\(G(x)\\).\n**Question 7.8.7**.: Suppose \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x),\\ldots\\) are all equal to \\(1+x\\).\n1. Expand the first three partial products: \\[P_{1}(x)=F_{1}(x)=(1+x)=?\\] \\[P_{2}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)=(1+x)^{2}=?\\] \\[P_{3}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)=(1+x)^{3}=?\\]\n2. What is the coefficient of \\(x\\) in your answers to part 1? Find a pattern and determine the coefficient of \\(x\\) in \\(P_{m}(x)\\).\n3. Prove that the infinite product \\[F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdot F_{4}(x)\\cdots=(1+x)(1+x)(1+x)(1+x)\\cdots\\] does **not** converge to any generating function, because the pattern you found in part 2 does not converge.\n**Question 7.8.8**.: Define \\(F_{i}(x)=1+x^{2^{i-1}}\\) for all \\(i\\).\n1. Write out \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x)\\), and \\(F_{4}(x)\\).\n2. Expand the first four partial products * \\(P_{1}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\), * \\(P_{2}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\), * \\(P_{3}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\), * \\(P_{4}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdot F_{4}(x)\\).\n3. Find a pattern and use it to prove that the infinite product \\[F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdots=(1+x)(1+x^{2})(1+x^{4})(1+x^{8})(1 +x^{16})\\cdots\\] does converge, and explain what generating function it converges to.\nFor the next two questions, you may find it helpful to watch the explanation in this section's video for why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-x^{i}}=\\sum p(n)x^{n}\\).\n**Question 7.8.9**.: Recall the definition of \\(q(n)\\) in Definition 7.8.3. Explain why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}(1+x^{i})=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}q(n)x^{n}\\).\n**Question 7.8.10**.: Explain why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-x^{2i}}=\\sum E(n)x^{n}\\) where \\(E(n)\\) is the number of partitions of \\(n\\) that use only even parts.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nTo account for edges, we move from the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\) to its **pair group**\\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\). The objects that \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\) permutes are the 2-element subsets of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\). For ease of notation, we will denote the 2-element subset \\(\\{i,j\\}\\) by \\(e_{ij}\\). To find the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), we consider the vertex permutations in \\(S_{4}\\) and see how they permute the \\(e_{ij}\\). The identity permutation \\(\\iota=(1)(2)(3)(4)\\) of \\(S_{4}\\) corresponds to the identity permutation \\(\\iota=(e_{12})(e_{13})(e_{14})(e_{23})(e_{24})(e_{34})\\) of \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\). Now let's consider the permutation \\((12)(3)(4)\\). It fixes \\(e_{12}\\) since it sends 1 to 2 and 2 to 1. It also fixes \\(e_{34}\\) by fixing 3 and 4. However, it interchanges \\(e_{13}\\) with \\(e_{23}\\) (3 is fixed and 1 is swapped with 2) and \\(e_{14}\\) with \\(e_{24}\\) (1 is sent to 2 and 4 is fixed). Thus, the corresponding permutation of pairs is \\((e_{12})(e_{13}e_{23})(e_{14}e_{24})(e_{34})\\). For another example, consider the permutation \\((123)(4)\\). It corresponds to the permutation \\((e_{12}e_{23}e_{13})(e_{14}e_{24}e_{34})\\) in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\).\nSince we're only after the cycle index of \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), we don't need to find all 24 permutations in the pair group. However, we do need to know the types of those permutations in terms of cycle lengths so we can associate the appropriate monomials. For the three examples we've considered, the cycle structure of the permutation in the pair group doesn't depend on the original permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) other than for _its_ cycle structure. Any permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a 2-cycle and two 1-cycles will correspond to a permutation with two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\). A permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) with one 3-cycle and one 1-cycle will correspond to a permutation with two 3-cycles in the pair group. By considering an example of a permutation in \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of a single 4-cycle, we find that the corresponding permutation in the pair group has a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. Finally, a permutation of \\(S_{4}\\) consisting of two 2-cycles corresponds to a permutation in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\) having two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles. (Exercise 15.6.8 asks you to verify these claims using specific permutations.)\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\nconsist of two 2-cycles, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose two elements for the first 2-cycle. The other two are then put in the second 2-cycle. However, this counts each permutation twice, once for when the first 2-cycle is the chosen pair and once for when it is the \"other two.\" Thus, there are 3 permutations consisting of two 2-cycles. Finally, only \\(\\iota\\) consists of four 1-cycles.\nNow we're prepared to write down the cycle index of the pair group\n\\[P_{S_{4}^{(2)}}(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{6})=\\frac{1}{24}\\left(x_{6}^{1}+9x_{1}^{2}x_{2 }^{2}+8x_{3}^{2}+6x_{2}x_{4}\\right).\\]\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nIn how many ways can a convex polygon with 8 sides be divided into triangles by connecting its vertices, with no intersecting lines?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nProof.: Suppose for a contradiction that \\(K_{5}\\) can be drawn as a planar graph. Note that \\(v=5\\) and \\(e=\\binom{5}{2}=10\\). By Euler's formula, then \\(v-e+f=2\\). So \\(5-10+f=2\\). This implies that \\(f=7\\).\nBy Lemma 11.3.1, \\(10=e\\geq\\frac{3f}{2}=\\frac{3.7}{2}=10.5\\). This is a contradiction, and hence \\(K_{5}\\) cannot be planar.\nSince \\(K_{5}\\) is not planar, any graph that contains \\(K_{5}\\) as a subgraph is not planar. One of the exercises is to show that \\(B_{3,3}\\) is not planar; because of this, any graph that contains \\(B_{3,3}\\) as a subgraph is not planar.\nThe following theorem says that the reason any graph is non-planar is because either \\(K_{5}\\) or \\(B_{3,3}\\) is hidden in the graph. In order to understand this theorem, we need to generalize the idea of subgraphs to a new concept of _minors_. (In some texts, this theorem is expressed using _subdivisions_ rather than minors.) We include this theorem just for your general knowledge -- we will often ask you to determine whether a graph is planar or not _without_ using Kuratowski's Theorem!\n**Definition 11.3.5**.: Given a graph \\(G\\), an _edge contraction_ is a way to make a new graph by removing an edge from \\(G\\) and merging the two vertices that were at its endpoints. A graph \\(H\\) is a _minor_ of \\(G\\) if \\(H\\) can be obtained from G by contracting some edges, deleting some edges, and deleting some isolated vertices.\nIn the graph below on the left, if we contract the red edge, then we obtain the graph below on the right.\n**Theorem 11.3.6** (Kuratowski's Theorem).: _A graph \\(G\\) is planar if and only if it does not contain \\(K_{5}\\) or \\(K_{3,3}\\) as a minor._\nFor example, the Petersen graph is not planar since it has \\(K_{5}\\) as a minor.\nIndeed, one can contract all five edges connecting the \"inner star\" to the \"outer pentagon\" to form a copy of \\(K_{5}\\).\n### Exercises\n1. What is the smallest number of crossings needed for a graph of \\(K_{5}\\) drawn in the plane? Illustrate this.\n2. Is it possible to find any set of nine edges from \\(K_{8}\\) such that if you remove those 9 edges then you obtain a (connected) planar graph? If so, draw it. If not, explain why not.\n3. If \\(G\\) is a bipartite graph which is a planar graph, prove that \\(e\\geq 2f\\).\n4. Prove that the complete bipartite graph \\(B_{3,3}\\) is not planar. You are not allowed to use Kuratowski's Theorem. (As a consequence, it is impossible to connect the above three houses on the left to the water, electricity and gas utilities on the right, without having some of the utility lines cross.)\n5. Draw the graph \\(B_{3,3}\\) in the plane with the smallest number of crossings possible.\n6. Show that the Petersen graph is not planar. (You are not allowed to use Kuratowski's Theorem.) Use the fact (which you don't need to prove) that there are no cycles of length \\(3\\) or \\(4\\) in the Petersen graph.\n7. Prove that a planar graph with \\(v\\) vertices (where \\(v\\geq 3\\)) has at most \\(3v-6\\) edges. This result says that a planar graph with a fixed number of vertices cannot have too many edges!\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThus in particular we have \\(D_{n+1,1}=D_{0}D_{n}\\), \\(D_{n+1,2}=D_{1}D_{n-1}\\), and so on. Plugging these formulas into Equation 6.8 above, we obtain\n\\[D_{n+1}=D_{0}D_{n}+D_{1}D_{n-1}+\\cdots+D_{n}D_{0}\\]\nas desired. Therefore, \\(D_{n}\\) satisfies the same recursion as the Catalan numbers, so \\(D_{n}=C_{n}\\) for all \\(n\\).\n**Theorem 6.6.4**.: _A closed form formula for the \\(n\\)th Catalan number is_\n\\[C_{n}=\\binom{2n}{n}-\\binom{2n}{n+1}=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}.\\] (6.9)\nTheorem 6.6.4 will be proven later in Section 7.6. It is not hard to check that the two formulas for \\(C_{n}\\) in (6.9) are the same.\nCatalan numbers do not just count Dyck paths; in fact, there are 214 different known combinatorial descriptions of the Catalan numbers2! Let's consider some descriptions in the case \\(n=3\\).\nFootnote 2: All of these descriptions can be found in the book “Catalan Numbers” by Richard Stanley.\n**Example 6.6.5**.: The fact that \\(C_{3}=5\\) is equivalent to there being 5 ways to:\n1. put parentheses around 4 letters \\[((xy)z)w,\\ (x(yz))w,\\ (xy)(zw),\\ x((yz)w),\\ x(y(zw));\\]\n2. divide a convex pentagon into triangles;\n3. tile a stair of height 3 with 3 rectangles;\n4. arrange the numbers \\(\\{1,\\ldots,6\\}\\) in a \\(2\\times 3\\) grid so that each row and each column is increasing;\n5. pair the vertices of a hexagon so that the line segments joining paired vertices do not intersect;\n6. draw a rooted binary tree with 4 leaves such that every vertex has either 0 or 2 children (we will see more about trees in Chapter 9).\n7. write down a sequence \\((a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{6})\\) of 1's and \\(-1\\)'s such that each partial sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{j}\\) is nonnegative and the entire sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{6}\\) is 0. \\[(1,1,1,-1,-1,-1),(1,1,-1,1,-1,-1),(1,1,-1,1,-1),(1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1)\\]\n### Exercises\n1. How many lattice paths from (0,0) to (4,4) using up and right unit steps stay **on or below** the diagonal?\n2. How many Dyck paths from (0,0) to (5,5) stay **strictly above** the diagonal, that is, they don't touch the diagonal at any point between (0,0) and (5,5)?\n3. Suppose candidates Uppity and Rightley are running for class president. 13 of the students in the class plan on voting; 6 of them will be voting for Uppity and 7 will be voting for Rightley. How many sequences of ballots (which can be thought of as sequences of 6 U's and 7 R's in some order) have the property that, as they are counted in order, Rightley is never ahead until the very last ballot is counted?\n4. When \\(n=4\\), then \\(C_{4}=14\\). In these exercises, find the 14 ways to do each of the following. 1. Draw a Dyck path; 2. write a Dyck word; 3. put parentheses around 5 letters \\(xyzwv\\); 4. divide a convex hexagon into triangles; 5. tile a stair of height 4 with rectangles; 6. arrange the numbers \\(\\{1,\\ldots,8\\}\\) in a \\(2\\times 4\\) grid so that each row and each column is increasing; 7. pair the vertices of an octagon so that the line segments joining paired vertices do not intersect; 8. draw a rooted binary tree with 5 leaves such that every vertex has either 0 or 2 children; 9. write down a sequence \\((a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{8})\\) of 1's and \\(-1\\)'s such that each partial sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{j}\\) is nonnegative and the entire sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{8}\\) is 0.\n\n\n",

So the number of ways to choose 103 people out of 107 gives the same answer.

To form such a binary string, we simply have to choose \\(k\\) positions for the 0's, out of \\(n\\) possible positions. This is the same as choosing an _unordered_ subset of \\(k\\) of the positions in the string (even though the string itself is ordered). Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n### Exercises\n1. You have 7 different rolls of wrapping paper and 4 identical teddy bears.

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3.

Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12.

The players mark the squares of the grid with the symbols X and O. This exercise uses Polya's enumeration theorem to investigate the number of different tic-tac-toe boards. (The analysis of _games_ is more complex, since it requires attention to the order the squares are marked and stopping when one player has won the game.)\n* Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the \\(9\\times 9\\) grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group \\(D_{8}\\) that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in Figure 15.16. For example, the effect of the transformation \\(r_{1}\\), which rotates the board \\(90^{\\circ}\\) clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as (13971)(2684)(5). Write each of the eight elements of \\(D_{8}\\) as permutations of the nine squares of a tic-tac-toe board.\n* Find the cycle index of \\(D_{8}\\) in terms of these permutations.\n* Make an appropriate substitution for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index to find a generating function \\(t(X,O)\\) in which the coefficient on \\(X^{i}O^{j}\\) is the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards having \\(i\\) squares filled by symbol X and \\(j\\) squares filled by symbol O. (Notice that some squares might be blank!)\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards are there?\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards have three X's and three O's?\n* When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 15.1 Coloring the Vertices of a Square\nLet's begin by coloring the vertices of a square using white and gold. If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\nFigure 15.1: The 16 colorings of the vertices of a square.\nby a different angle.)\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\n\n",

How many handshakes took place?\nThere are several ways to approach this problem. One way is to reason that, because 5 students each shake 4 hands, and each handshake involves 2 students, we counted \\(5\\cdot 4=20\\) handshakes but counted each handshake twice. So exactly 10 handshakes took place.\nAnother way to see this is to call the students \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and directly count the handshakes as follows. Student \\(a\\) shakes hands with 4 others, then student \\(b\\) shakes hands with 3 others besides \\(a\\), then student \\(c\\) shakes 2 more hands besides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then student \\(d\\) shakes 1 more hand (with \\(e\\)), and finally student \\(e\\) does not need to shake any more hands. So the total number of handshakes is \\(1+2+3+4=10\\).\nFinally, we can visually model this problem by drawing a dot to represent each student, and a line segment connecting each pair of dots to represent the handshakes:\nWith this visual tool, called a _graph_, we can count that there are 10 line segments (the handshakes) between the labeled dots (the students). The graph above is called \\(K_{5}\\), the \"complete graph on 5 vertices.\" The dots representing the students are called _vertices_ of the graph, and line segments between the vertices are called _edges_. The intersection points of the line segments which are not labeled should be ignored; they are not vertices. We say the graph is _complete_ because every two vertices are connected by an edge.\nIn this class, Introduction to Combinatorics, we will learn about counting problems, mathematical proofs, generating functions, and graph theory. Here are some examples of questions that we will answer. These questions will become more complicated when we later increase the number of students beyond 5.\n**Chapters 2-4: Basic counting, sets, and binomial coefficients.**\n1.

Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car.

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom.

The players mark the squares of the grid with the symbols X and O. This exercise uses Polya's enumeration theorem to investigate the number of different tic-tac-toe boards. (The analysis of _games_ is more complex, since it requires attention to the order the squares are marked and stopping when one player has won the game.)\n* Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the \\(9\\times 9\\) grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group \\(D_{8}\\) that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in Figure 15.16. For example, the effect of the transformation \\(r_{1}\\), which rotates the board \\(90^{\\circ}\\) clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as (13971)(2684)(5). Write each of the eight elements of \\(D_{8}\\) as permutations of the nine squares of a tic-tac-toe board.\n* Find the cycle index of \\(D_{8}\\) in terms of these permutations.\n* Make an appropriate substitution for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index to find a generating function \\(t(X,O)\\) in which the coefficient on \\(X^{i}O^{j}\\) is the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards having \\(i\\) squares filled by symbol X and \\(j\\) squares filled by symbol O. (Notice that some squares might be blank!)\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards are there?\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards have three X's and three O's?\n* When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 15.1 Coloring the Vertices of a Square\nLet's begin by coloring the vertices of a square using white and gold. If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\nFigure 15.1: The 16 colorings of the vertices of a square.\nby a different angle.)\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\n\n",

The coefficient of \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) is the multinomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}\\). In other words,_\n\\[(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}=\\sum_{k_{1}+\\ldots+k_{m}=n}\\binom{n}{k_{1}, \\cdots,k_{m}}x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}.\\]\nFor example, the term \\(3x^{2}y\\) in the above expansion of \\((x+y+z)^{3}\\) can be written as \\(3x^{2}y^{1}z^{0}\\), which does indeed agree with the multinomial coefficient\n\\[\\binom{3}{2,1,0}=3.\\]\nThe following proof is quite difficult and it is alright for you to come back to it after gaining more experience with proofs.\nProof.: We can count how many ways to obtain the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) by multiplying terms in the expansion as follows. We label the factors of \\((x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}\\) by \\(F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\). (Each factor equals \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m}\\) but we think of them as being different since one of them is first, second, etc). Let \\(S=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}\\) be the set of the \\(n\\) factors. To make the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) in the product, we need to choose the variable \\(x_{1}\\) from \\(k_{1}\\) of the factors, then choose the variable \\(x_{2}\\) from \\(k_{2}\\) of the factors, and so on. This forms an ordered set partition of \\(S\\) with sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\), and so the result follows by Theorem 4.6.3.\n### Exercises\n1.
