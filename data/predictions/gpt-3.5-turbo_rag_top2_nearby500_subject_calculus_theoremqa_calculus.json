We compute \\(x^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\), \\(y^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{\\sin t}{1-\\cos t}.\\]\nNote that when \\(t\\) is an odd multiple of \\(\\pi\\), like \\(\\pi\\) or \\(3\\pi\\), this is \\((0/2)=0\\), so there is a horizontal tangent line, in agreement with figure 10.4.1. At even multiples of \\(\\pi\\), the fraction is \\(0/0\\), which is undefined. The figure shows that there is no tangent line at such points. \\(\\Box\\)\nAreas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on the curve and the area desired. We can potentially compute areas between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis quite easily.\n##### Example 10.5.2\nFind the area under one arch of the cycloid \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\). We would like to compute\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y\\;dx,\\]\nbut we do not know \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\). However, the parametric equations allow us to make a substitution: use \\(y=1-\\cos t\\) to replace \\(y\\), and compute \\(dx=(1-\\cos t)\\;dt\\). Then the integral becomes\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(1-\\cos t)(1-\\cos t)\\;dt=3\\pi.\\]\nFigure 10.4.4: An involute of a circle.\n### Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations\nNote that we need to convert the original \\(x\\) limits to \\(t\\) limits using \\(x=t-\\sin t\\). When \\(x=0\\), \\(t=\\sin t\\), which happens only when \\(t=0\\). Likewise, when \\(x=2\\pi\\), \\(t-2\\pi=\\sin t\\) and \\(t=2\\pi\\). Alternately, because we understand how the cycloid is produced, we can see directly that one arch is generated by \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\). In general, of course, the \\(t\\) limits will be different than the \\(x\\) limits. \\(\\Box\\)\nThis technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas, as illustrated by the exercises.\nAs a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric equations. Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), and develops the formula for length:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx.\\]\nUsing some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use parametric equations \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx&=\\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;\\frac{dt}{dx}\\;dx\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2}}\\;dt\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v} \\sqrt{(f^{\\prime}(t))^{2}+(g^{\\prime}(t))^{2}}\\;dt.}\\]\nHere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the \\(t\\) limits corresponding to the \\(x\\) limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n**EXAMPLE 10.5.3** Find the length of one arch of the cycloid. From \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\), we get the derivatives \\(f^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so the length is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{(1-\\cos t)^{2}+\\sin^{2}t}\\;dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{2-2 \\cos t}\\;dt.\\]\nNow we use the formula \\(\\sin^{2}(t/2)=(1-\\cos(t))/2\\) or \\(4\\sin^{2}(t/2)=2-2\\cos t\\) to get\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{4\\sin^{2}(t/2)}\\;dt.\\]\nSince \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\), \\(\\sin(t/2)\\geq 0\\), so we can rewrite this as\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}2\\sin(t/2)\\;dt=8.\\]\n### 10.5 Calculus with Parametric Equations\nExercises 10.5.1: Consider the curve of exercise 6 in section 10.4. Find all values of \\(t\\) for which the curve has a horizontal tangent line. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nConsider the curve of exercise 6 in section 10.4.

Set up an integral for the length of one arch of the curve. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 16.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals\nOne way to write the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (7.2.1) is:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx=f(b)-f(a).\\]\nThat is, to compute the integral of a derivative \\(f^{\\prime}\\) we need only compute the values of \\(f\\) at the endpoints. Something similar is true for line integrals of a certain form.\n**Theorem 16.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals**  Suppose a curve \\(C\\) is given by the vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), with \\({\\bf a}={\\bf r}(a)\\) and \\({\\bf b}={\\bf r}(b)\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=f({\\bf b})-f({\\bf a}),\\]\nprovided that \\({\\bf r}\\) is sufficiently nice.\nProof.: We write \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\\rangle\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle x^{\\prime}(t),y^{\\prime}(t),z^{\\prime}(t)\\rangle\\). Also, we know that \\(\\nabla f=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle \\cdot\\langle x^{\\prime}(t),y^{\\prime}(t),z^{\\prime}(t)\\rangle\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b }f_{x}x^{\\prime}+f_{y}y^{\\prime}+f_{z}z^{\\prime}\\,dt.\\]\nBy the chain rule (see section 14.4) \\(f_{x}x^{\\prime}+f_{y}y^{\\prime}+f_{z}z^{\\prime}=df/dt\\), where \\(f\\) in this context means \\(f(x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), a function of \\(t\\). In other words, all we have is\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}f^{\\prime}(t)\\,dt=f(b)-f(a).\\]\nIn this context, \\(f(a)=f(x(a),y(a),z(a))\\). Since \\({\\bf a}={\\bf r}(a)=\\langle x(a),y(a),z(a)\\rangle\\), we can write \\(f(a)=f({\\bf a})\\)--this is a bit of a cheat, since we are simultaneously using \\(f\\) to mean \\(f(t)\\) and \\(f(x,y,z)\\), and since \\(f(x(a),y(a),z(a))\\) is not technically the same as \\(f(\\langle x(a),y(a),z(a)\\rangle)\\), but the concepts are clear and the different uses are compatible. Doing the same for \\(b\\), we get\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}f^{\\prime}(t)\\,dt=f(b)-f(a)=f({\\bf b })-f({\\bf a}).\\]\nThis theorem, like the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, says roughly that if we integrate a \"derivative-like function\" (\\(f^{\\prime}\\) or \\(\\nabla f\\)) the result depends only on the values of the original function (\\(f\\)) at the endpoints.\nIf a vector field \\({\\bf F}\\) is the gradient of a function, \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla f\\), we say that \\({\\bf F}\\) is a **conservative vector field**. If \\({\\bf F}\\) is a conservative force field, then the integral for work, \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\), is in the form required by the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals. This means that in a conservative force field, the amount of work required to move an object from point \\({\\bf a}\\) to point \\({\\bf b}\\) depends only on those points, not on the path taken between them.\n**Example 16.3.2**: An object moves in the force field\n\\[{\\bf F}=\\left\\langle\\frac{-x}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-y}{(x^{2}+y^{ 2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-z}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}}\\right\\rangle,\\]\nalong the curve \\({\\bf r}=\\langle 1+t,t^{3},t\\cos(\\pi t)\\rangle\\) as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Find the work done by the force on the object.\nThe straightforward way to do this involves substituting the components of \\({\\bf r}\\) into \\({\\bf F}\\), forming the dot product \\({\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\), and then trying to compute the integral, but this integral is extraordinarily messy, perhaps impossible to compute. But since \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla(1/\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}})\\) we need only substitute:\n\\[\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\left.\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right| _{(1,0,0)}^{(2,1,-1)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}-1.\\]\n### The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals\nAnother immediate consequence of the Fundamental Theorem involves **closed paths**. A path \\(C\\) is closed if it forms a loop, so that traveling over the \\(C\\) curve brings you back to the starting point. If \\(C\\) is a closed path, we can integrate around it starting at any point \\({\\bf a}\\); since the starting and ending points are the same,\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=f({\\bf a})-f({\\bf a})=0.\\]\n\n\n",

We can graph \\(g\\) using the six step procedure outlined in Section 4.2. We get the sole intercept at \\((0,0)\\), a vertical asymptote \\(x=1\\) and a horizontal asymptote (which the graph never crosses) \\(y=-2\\). We see from that the graph of \\(g\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test.\n3. 1. We begin with \\(h(c)=h(d)\\). As we work our way through the problem, we encounter a nonlinear equation. We move the non-zero terms to the left, leave a \\(0\\) on the right and factor accordingly. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}h(c)&=&h(d)\\\\ c^{2}-2c+4&=&d^{2}-2d+4\\\\ c^{2}-2c&=&d^{2}-2d\\\\ c^{2}-d^{2}-2c+2d&=&0\\\\ (c+d)(c-d)-2(c-d)&=&0\\\\ (c-d)((c+d)-2)&=&0\\\\ c-d=0&\\mbox{or}&c+d-2=0\\\\ c=d&\\mbox{or}&c=2-d\\end{array}\\] factor by grouping We get \\(c=d\\) as one possibility, but we also get the possibility that \\(c=2-d\\). This suggests that \\(f\\) may not be one-to-one. Taking \\(d=0\\), we get \\(c=0\\) or \\(c=2\\). With \\(f(0)=4\\) and \\(f(2)=4\\), we have produced two different inputs with the same output meaning \\(f\\) is not one-to-one. 2. We note that \\(h\\) is a quadratic function and we graph \\(y=h(x)\\) using the techniques presented in Section 2.3. The vertex is \\((1,3)\\) and the parabola opens upwards. We see immediately from the graph that \\(h\\) is not one-to-one, since there are several horizontal lines which cross the graph more than once.\n4. 1. The function \\(F\\) is given to us as a set of ordered pairs. The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\nWe have shown that the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1 are one-to-one. This means they are invertible, so it is natural to wonder what \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) would be. For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\). We can track step-by-step what is done to \\(x\\) and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter. The function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x}{1-x}\\) is a bit trickier since \\(x\\) occurs in two places. When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem. Theorem 5.2 tells us equation \\(y=f^{-1}(x)\\) is equivalent to \\(f(y)=x\\) and this is the basis of our algorithm.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|} \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Steps for finding the Inverse of a One-to-one Function**} \\\\\n1.

This means that the maximum profit is a whopping $41.67 when the price per dOpi is set to $275. At this price, we can produce and sell \\(p^{-1}(275)=11.\\overline{6}\\) dOpis. Since we cannot sell part of a system, we need to adjust the price to sell either 11 dOpis or 12 dOpis. We find \\(p(11)=285\\) and \\(p(12)=270\\), which means we set the price per dOpi at either $285 or $270, respectively. The profits at these prices are \\(\\left(P\\circ p^{-1}\\right)(285)=35\\) and \\(\\left(P\\circ p^{-1}\\right)(270)=40\\), so it looks as if the maximum profit is $40 and it is made by producing and selling 12 dOpis a week at a price of $270 per dOpi.\n\n\n",

Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\nThis has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:\nProof that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Given any \\(\\epsilon\\), pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Then when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), \\(|x+2|<5\\) and \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\nguarantees that \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? Of course: no matter what \\(\\epsilon\\) is, \\(\\delta=\\epsilon\\) works. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it turns out to be very easy to prove something \"obvious,\" which is nice. It doesn't take long before things get trickier, however.\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)?

We have seen one way to look at it, by viewing the desired area as a big area minus a small area, which leads naturally to the difference between two integrals. But it is instructive to consider how we might find the desired area directly. We can approximate the area by dividing the area into thin sections and approximating the area of each section by a rectangle, as indicated in figure 9.1.2. The area of a typical rectangle is \\(\\Delta x(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i}))\\), so the total area is approximately\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i}))\\Delta x.\\]\nThis is exactly the sort of sum that turns into an integral in the limit, namely the integral\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx.\\]\nOf course, this is the integral we actually computed above, but we have now arrived at it directly rather than as a modification of the difference between two other integrals. In that example it really doesn't matter which approach we take, but in some cases this second approach is better.\n### Area between curves\n**Example 9.1.2**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+1\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\); these are the same curves as before but lowered by 2. In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips below the \\(x\\)-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area by rectangles. The height of a typical rectangle will still be \\(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i})\\), even if \\(g(x_{i})\\) is negative. Thus the area is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+1-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x -2\\,dx.\\]\nThis is of course the same integral as before, because the region between the curves is identical to the former region--it has just been moved down by 2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 9.1.3**: Find the area between \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}-6x+5\\) over the interval \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\); the curves are shown in figure 9.1.4. Generally we should interpret\nFigure 9.1.3: Area between curves.\nFigure 9.1.2: Approximating area between curves with rectangles.\n\"area\" in the usual sense, as a necessarily positive quantity. Since the two curves cross, we need to compute two areas and add them. First we find the intersection point of the curves:\n\\[-x^{2}+4x =x^{2}-6x+5\\] \\[0 =2x^{2}-10x+5\\] \\[x =\\frac{10\\pm\\sqrt{100-40}}{4}=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{15}}{2}.\\]\nThe intersection point we want is \\(x=a=(5-\\sqrt{15})/2\\). Then the total area is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{a}x^{2}-6x+5-(-x^{2}+4x)\\,dx +\\int_{a}^{1}-x^{2}+4x-(x^{2}-6x+5)\\,dx\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{a}2x^{2}-10x+5\\,dx+\\int_{a}^{1}-2x^{2}+10x-5\\,dx\\] \\[=\\left.\\frac{2x^{3}}{3}-5x^{2}+5x\\right|_{0}^{a}+-\\frac{2x^{3}}{3 }+5x^{2}-5x\\right|_{a}^{1}\\] \\[=-\\frac{52}{3}+5\\sqrt{15},\\]\nafter a bit of simplification. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 9.1.4**: Find the area between \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}-6x+5\\); the curves are shown in figure 9.1.5. Here we are not given a specific interval, so it must\nFigure 9.1.4: Area between curves that cross.\nbe the case that there is a \"natural\" region involved. Since the curves are both parabolas, the only reasonable interpretation is the region between the two intersection points, which we found in the previous example:\n\n\n",

Combining these results, we have \\(4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(4x^{2}-12\\right)\\). To find the remaining zeros of \\(p\\), we set \\(4x^{2}-12=0\\) and get \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\).\nA couple of things about the last example are worth mentioning. First, the extension of the synthetic division tableau for repeated divisions will be a common site in the sections to come. Typically, we will start with a higher order polynomial and peel off one zero at a time until we are left with a quadratic, whose roots can always be found using the Quadratic Formula. Secondly, we found \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\) are zeros of \\(p\\). The Factor Theorem guarantees \\(\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x-\\left(-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\) are both factors of \\(p\\). We can certainly put the Factor Theorem to the test and continue the synthetic division tableau from above to see what happens.\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\\frac{1}{2}&4&-4&-11&12&-3\\\\ \\downarrow&2&-1&-6&3\\\\ \\hline\\frac{1}{2}&4&-2&-12&6&0\\\\ \\downarrow&2&0&-6\\\\ \\hline\\sqrt{3}&\\framebox{4}&0&-12&0\\\\ \\downarrow&4\\sqrt{3}&12\\\\ \\downarrow&4\\sqrt{3}&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4\\sqrt{3}&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4\\sqrt{3}&\\\\ \\hline 4&\\framebox{0}\\end{array}\\]\nThis gives us \\(4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-\\sqrt{3} \\right)\\left(x-\\left(-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\left(4\\right)\\), or, when written with the constant in front\n\\[p(x)=4\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left(- \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\]\nWe have shown that \\(p\\) is a product of its leading coefficient times linear factors of the form \\((x-c)\\) where \\(c\\) are zeros of \\(p\\). It may surprise and delight the reader that, in theory, all polynomials can be reduced to this kind of factorization. We leave that discussion to Section 3.4, because the zeros may not be real numbers. Our final theorem in the section gives us an upper bound on the number of real zeros.\n**Theorem 3.7**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a polynomial of degree \\(n\\geq 1\\). Then \\(f\\) has at most \\(n\\) real zeros, counting multiplicities.\nTheorem 3.7 is a consequence of the Factor Theorem and polynomial multiplication. Every zero \\(c\\) of \\(f\\) gives us a factor of the form \\((x-c)\\) for \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(f\\) has degree \\(n\\), there can be at most \\(n\\) of these factors. The next section provides us some tools which not only help us determine where the real zeros are to be found, but which real numbers they may be.\nWe close this section with a summary of several concepts previously presented. You should take the time to look back through the text to see where each concept was first introduced and where each connection to the other concepts was made.\n**Connections Between Zeros, Factors and Graphs of Polynomial Functions**\nSuppose \\(p\\) is a polynomial function of degree \\(n\\geq 1\\). The following statements are equivalent:\n* The real number \\(c\\) is a zero of \\(p\\)\n* \\(p(c)=0\\)\n* \\(x=c\\) is a solution to the polynomial equation \\(p(x)=0\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThree of the families of functions studied thus far - constant, linear and quadratic - belong to a much larger group of functions called **polynomials**. We begin our formal study of general polynomials with a definition and some examples.\n**Definition 3.1**.: A **polynomial function** is a function of the form\n\\[f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\ldots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0},\\]\nwhere \\(a_{0}\\), \\(a_{1}\\), ..., \\(a_{n}\\) are real numbers and \\(n\\geq 1\\) is a natural number. The domain of a polynomial function is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\nThere are several things about Definition 3.1 that may be off-putting or downright frightening. The best thing to do is look at an example. Consider \\(f(x)=4x^{5}-3x^{2}+2x-5\\). Is this a polynomial function? We can re-write the formula for \\(f\\) as \\(f(x)=4x^{5}+0x^{4}+0x^{3}+(-3)x^{2}+2x+(-5)\\). Comparing this with Definition 3.1, we identify \\(n=5\\), \\(a_{5}=4\\), \\(a_{4}=0\\), \\(a_{3}=0\\), \\(a_{2}=-3\\), \\(a_{1}=2\\) and \\(a_{0}=-5\\). In other words, \\(a_{5}\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{5}\\), \\(a_{4}\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{4}\\), and so forth; the subscript on the \\(a\\)'s merely indicates to which power of \\(x\\) the coefficient belongs. The business of restricting \\(n\\) to be a natural number lets us focus on well-behaved algebraic animals.1\nFootnote 1: Enjoy this while it lasts. Before we’re through with the book, you’ll have been exposed to the most terrible of algebraic beasts. We will tame them all, in time.\n**Example 3.1.1**.: Determine if the following functions are polynomials. Explain your reasoning.\n1. \\(g(x)=\\frac{4+x^{3}}{x}\\) 2. \\(p(x)=\\frac{4x+x^{3}}{x}\\) 3. \\(q(x)=\\frac{4x+x^{3}}{x^{2}+4}\\)\n4. \\(f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) 5. \\(h(x)=|x|\\) 6. \\(z(x)=0\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. We note directly that the domain of \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4}{x}\\) is \\(x\\neq 0\\). By definition, a polynomial has all real numbers as its domain. Hence, \\(g\\) can't be a polynomial.\n2. Even though \\(p(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x}\\) simplifies to \\(p(x)=x^{2}+4\\), which certainly looks like the form given in Definition 3.1, the domain of \\(p\\), which, as you may recall, we determine _before_ we simplify, excludes \\(0\\). Alas, \\(p\\) is not a polynomial function for the same reason \\(g\\) isn't.\n3. After what happened with \\(p\\) in the previous part, you may be a little shy about simplifying \\(q(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x^{2}+4}\\) to \\(q(x)=x\\), which certainly fits Definition 3.1. If we look at the domain of \\(q\\) before we simplified, we see that it is, indeed, all real numbers. A function which can be written in the form of Definition 3.1 whose domain is all real numbers is, in fact, a polynomial.\n4. We can rewrite \\(f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) as \\(f(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is not a natural number, \\(f\\) is not a polynomial.\n5. The function \\(h(x)=|x|\\) isn't a polynomial, since it can't be written as a combination of powers of \\(x\\) even though it can be written as a piecewise function involving polynomials. As we shall see in this section, graphs of polynomials possess a quality2 that the graph of \\(h\\) does not. Footnote 2: Some authors say \\(f(x)=0\\) has degree \\(-\\infty\\) for reasons not even we will go into.\n6. There's nothing in Definition 3.1 which prevents all the coefficients \\(a_{n}\\), etc., from being \\(0\\). Hence, \\(z(x)=0\\), is an honest-to-goodness polynomial.\n**Definition 3.2**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a polynomial function.\n* Given \\(f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\ldots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}\\) with \\(a_{n}\\neq 0\\), we say\n* The natural number \\(n\\) is called the **degree*\n* of the polynomial \\(f\\).\n* The term \\(a_{n}x^{n}\\) is called the **leading term*\n* of the polynomial \\(f\\).\n\n\n",

The solutions to \\(\\cos(u)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) are \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n3. Since \\(\\cot(3x)=0\\) has the form \\(\\cot(u)=0\\), we know \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\), so, in this case, \\(3x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) yields \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}k\\). Checking our answers, we get \\[\\cot\\left(3\\left[\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}+\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}k\\right]\\right) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of cotangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= 0\\] As \\(k\\) runs through the integers, we obtain six answers, corresponding to \\(k=0\\) through \\(k=5\\), which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\,\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\,\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\) , \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\). To confirm these graphically, we must be careful. On many calculators, there is no function button for cotangent. We choose4 to use the quotient identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis), we see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points approximately match our solutions. Footnote 4: The reader is encouraged to see what happens if we had chosen the reciprocal identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{1}{\\tan(3x)}\\) instead. The graph on the calculator _appears_ identical, but what happens when you try to find the intersection points?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n4. To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\nTo solve \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\), we need the techniques in Chapter 3 to factor \\(4u^{3}-2u-2\\) into \\((u-1)\\left(4u^{2}+4u+2\\right)\\). We get either \\(u-1=0\\) or \\(4u^{2}+2u+2=0\\), and since the discriminant of the latter is negative, the only real solution to \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\) is \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), so \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The only solution which lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) is \\(x=0\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y=2-\\cos(x)\\) on the same set of axes over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) shows that the graphs intersect at what appears to be \\((0,1)\\), as required. \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=3\\cos(x)-2}\\) \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=2-\\cos(x)}\\)\n5. While we could approach \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\) in the same manner as we did the previous two problems, we choose instead to showcase the utility of the Sum to Product Identities. From \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=0\\), and it is the presence of \\(0\\) on the right hand side that indicates a switch to a product would be a good move.7 Using Theorem 10.21, we have that \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=-2\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x+3x}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x-3x}{2} \\right)=-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)\\). Hence, the equation \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is equivalent to \\(-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)=0\\). From this, we get \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=0\\). Solving \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\), and the solution to \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) is \\(x=\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The second set of solutions is contained in the first set of solutions,8 so our final solution to \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\). There are eight of these answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\). Our plot of the graphs of \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y=\\cos(5x)\\) below (after some careful zooming) bears this out. Footnote 7: As always, experience is the greatest teacher here!\n\n\n",

First note that neither the formula given for \\(g(x)\\) nor the one given for \\(h(x)\\) match the form given in Definition 2.5. We could, of course, convert both \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) into that form by expanding and collecting like terms. Doing so, we find \\(g(x)=(x+2)^{2}-3=x^{2}+4x+1\\) and \\(h(x)=-2(x-3)^{2}+1=-2x^{2}+12x-17\\). While these 'simplified' formulas for \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) satisfy Definition 2.5, they do not lend themselves to graphing easily. For that reason, the form of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) presented in Example 2.3.2 is given a special name, which we list below, along with the form presented in Definition 2.5.\n**Definition 2.6**.: **Standard and General Form of Quadratic Functions**: Suppose \\(f\\) is a quadratic function.\n* The **general form** of the quadratic function \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\).\n* The **standard form** of the quadratic function \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k\\), where \\(a\\), \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\).\nIt is important to note at this stage that we have no guarantees that _every_ quadratic function can be written in standard form. This is actually true, and we prove this later in the exposition, but for now we celebrate the advantages of the standard form, starting with the following theorem.\n**Theorem 2.2**.: **Vertex Formula for Quadratics in Standard Form**: For the quadratic function \\(f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k\\), where \\(a\\), \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\), the vertex of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) is \\((h,k)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nsubtle notations on the graph: the arrowhead on the lower left corner of the graph indicates that the graph continues to curve downwards to the left forever more; and the open circle at \\((1,3)\\) indicates that the point \\((1,3)\\) isn't on the graph, but all points on the curve leading up to that point are.\n\\(\\bullet\\)\\(\nAll functions are relations, but not all relations are functions. Thus the equations which described the relations in Section1.2 may or may not describe \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\). The algebraic representation of functions is possibly the most important way to view them so we need a process for determining whether or not an equation of a relation represents a function. (We delay the discussion of finding the domain of a function given algebraically until Section 1.4.)\n**Example 1.3.5**.: Determine which equations represent \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\).\n1. \\(x^{3}+y^{2}=1\\) \\(x^{2}+y^{3}=1\\) \\(x^{2}y=1-3y\\)\n**Solution.** For each of these equations, we solve for \\(y\\) and determine whether each choice of \\(x\\) will determine only one corresponding value of \\(y\\).\n1. \\[x^{3}+y^{2} = 1\\] \\[y^{2} = 1-x^{3}\\] \\[\\sqrt{y^{2}} = \\sqrt{1-x^{3}}\\] extract square roots \\[y = \\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{3}}\\] If we substitute \\(x=0\\) into our equation for \\(y\\), we get \\(y=\\pm\\sqrt{1-0^{3}}=\\pm 1\\), so that \\((0,1)\\) and \\((0,-1)\\) are on the graph of this equation. Hence, this equation does not represent \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\).\n2. \\[x^{2}+y^{3} = 1\\] \\[\\frac{y^{3}}{\\sqrt[3]{y^{3}}} = \\sqrt[3]{1-x^{2}}\\] \\[y = \\sqrt[3]{1-x^{2}}\\] For every choice of \\(x\\), the equation \\(y=\\sqrt[3]{1-x^{2}}\\) returns only **one** value of \\(y\\). Hence, this equation describes \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\).\n3. \\[x^{2}y = 1-3y\\] \\[x^{2}y+3y = 1\\] \\[y\\left(x^{2}+3\\right) = 1\\] factor \\[y = \\frac{1}{x^{2}+3}\\]\nFor each choice of \\(x\\), there is only one value for \\(y\\), so this equation describes \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\).\nWe could try to use our graphing calculator to verify our responses to the previous example, but we immediately run into trouble. The calculator's \"Y=\" menu requires that the equation be of the form '\\(y\\) = some expression of \\(x\\)'. If we wanted to verify that the first equation in Example 1.3.5\ndoes not represent \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\), we would need to enter two separate expressions into the calculator: one for the positive square root and one for the negative square root we found when solving the equation for \\(y\\). As predicted, the resulting graph shown below clearly fails the Vertical Line Test, so the equation does not represent \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\).\nThus in order to use the calculator to show that \\(x^{3}+y^{2}=1\\) does not represent \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\) we needed to know _analytically_ that \\(y\\) was not a function of \\(x\\) so that we could use the calculator properly. There are more advanced graphing utilities out there which can do implicit function plots, but you need to know even more Algebra to make them work properly. Do you get the point we're trying to make here? We believe it is in your best interest to learn the analytic way of doing things so that you are always smarter than your calculator.\n#### 1.3 Introduction to Functions\n\n\n",

Since we have the same base on both sides of the equation \\(\\log_{117}(1-3x)=\\log_{117}\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\), we equate what's inside the logs to get \\(1-3x=x^{2}-3\\). Solving \\(x^{2}+3x-4=0\\) gives \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=1\\). To check these answers using the calculator, we make use of the change of base formula and graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-3x)}{\\ln(117)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)}{\\ln(117)}\\) and we see they intersect only at \\(x=-4\\). To see what happened to the solution \\(x=1\\), we substitute it into our original equation to obtain \\(\\log_{117}(-2)=\\log_{117}(-2)\\). While these expressions look identical, neither is a real number,1 which means \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of the original equation, and is not a solution. Footnote 1: They do, however, represent the same **family** of complex numbers. We stop ourselves at this point and refer the reader to a good course in Complex Variables.\n2. Our first objective in solving \\(2-\\ln(x-3)=1\\) is to isolate the logarithm. We get \\(\\ln(x-3)=1\\), which, as an exponential equation, is \\(e^{1}=x-3\\). We get our solution \\(x=e+3\\). On the calculator, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=2-\\ln(x-3)\\) intersects the graph of \\(g(x)=1\\) at \\(x=e+3\\approx 5.718\\).\n3. We can start solving \\(\\log_{6}(x+4)+\\log_{6}(3-x)=1\\) by using the Product Rule for logarithms to rewrite the equation as \\(\\log_{6}\\left[(x+4)(3-x)\\right]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation, we get \\(6^{1}=(x+4)(3-x)\\). This reduces to \\(x^{2}+x-6=0\\), which gives \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\). Graphing \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+4)}{\\ln(6)}+\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(6)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1\\), we see they intersect twice, at \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\).\n4. Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\). When we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+3)}{\\ln(2)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln(6-x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\), we find they intersect at \\(x=5\\).\n6. Starting with \\(1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\), we gather the logs to one side to get the equation \\(1=2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\). Before we can combine the logarithms, however, we need a common base. Since 4 is a power of 2, we use change of base to convert \\[\\log_{4}(x+1)=\\frac{\\log_{2}(x+1)}{\\log_{2}(4)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Hence, our original equation becomes \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\right)\\] \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Power Rule \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}\\right)\\] Quotient Rule Rewriting this in exponential form, we get \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}=2\\) or \\(x^{2}-2x-2=0\\). Using the quadratic formula, we get \\(x=1\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\). Graphing \\(f(x)=1+\\frac{2\\ln(x+1)}{\\ln(4)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\), we see the graphs intersect only at \\(x=1+\\sqrt{3}\\approx 2.732\\). The solution \\(x=1-\\sqrt{3}<0\\), which means if substituted into the original equation, the term \\(2\\log_{2}\\left(1-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) is undefined.\n\\(y=f(x)=1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\) and \\(y=g(x)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\)\nIf nothing else, Example 6.4.1 demonstrates the importance of checking for extraneous solutions2 when solving equations involving logarithms. Even though we checked our answers graphically, extraneous solutions are easy to spot - any supposed solution which causes a negative number inside a logarithm needs to be discarded. As with the equations in Example 6.3.1, much can be learned from checking all of the answers in Example 6.4.1 analytically. We leave this to the reader and turn our attention to inequalities involving logarithmic functions. Since logarithmic functions are continuous on their domains, we can use sign diagrams.\nFootnote 2: Recall that an extraneous solution is an answer obtained analytically which does not satisfy the original equation.\n**Example 6.4.2**.: Solve the following inequalities. Check your answer graphically using a calculator.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. We start solving \\(\\frac{1}{\\ln(x)+1}\\leq 1\\) by getting \\(0\\) on one side of the inequality: \\(\\frac{1}{\\ln(x)+1}-1\\leq 0\\). Getting a common denominator yields \\(\\frac{1}{\\ln(x)+1}-\\frac{\\ln(x)+1}{\\ln(x)+1}\\leq 0\\) which reduces to \\(\\frac{-\\ln(x)}{\\ln(x)+1}\\leq 0\\), or \\(\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(x)+1}\\geq 0\\). We define \\(r(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(x)+1}\\) and set about finding the domain and the zeros of \\(r\\). Due to the appearance of the term \\(\\ln(x)\\), we require \\(x>0\\). In order to keep the denominator away from zero, we solve \\(\\ln(x)+1=0\\) so \\(\\ln(x)=-1\\), so \\(x=e^{-1}=\\frac{1}{e}\\). Hence, the domain of \\(r\\) is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{1}{e},\\infty\\right)\\). To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(x)+1}=0\\) so that \\(\\ln(x)=0\\), and we find \\(x=e^{0}=1\\). In order to determine test values for \\(r\\) without resorting to the calculator, we need to find numbers between \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{1}{e}\\), and \\(1\\) which have a base of \\(e\\). Since \\(e\\approx 2.718>1\\), \\(0<\\frac{1}{e^{2}}<\\frac{1}{e}<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}}<1<e\\). To determine the sign of \\(r\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)\\), we use the fact that \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)=\\ln\\left(e^{-2}\\right)=-2\\), and find \\(r\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{-2}{-2+1}=2\\), which is \\((+)\\). The rest of the test values are determined similarly. From our sign diagram, we find the solution to be \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\cup[1,\\infty)\\). Graphing \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\ln(x)+1}\\) and \\(g(x)=1\\), we see the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\) on the solution intervals, and that the graphs intersect at \\(x=1\\).\n2. Moving all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}<2\\log_{2}(x)+3\\) to one side of the inequality, we have \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3<0\\). Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\), we get \\(\\log_{2}(x)=-1\\), which gives us \\(x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\log_{2}(x)=3\\), which yields \\(x=2^{3}=8\\). We use test values which are powers of \\(2\\): \\(0<\\frac{1}{4}<\\frac{1}{2}<1<8<16\\), and from our sign diagram, we see \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},8\\right)\\). Geometrically, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{2}\\) is below the graph of \\(y=g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\) on the solution interval.\n3. We begin to solve \\(x\\log(x+1)\\geq x\\) by subtracting \\(x\\) from both sides to get \\(x\\log(x+1)-x\\geq 0\\). We define \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x\\) and due to the presence of the logarithm, we require \\(x+1>0\\), or \\(x>-1\\). To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x=0\\). Factoring, we get \\(x\\left(\\log(x+1)-1\\right)=0\\), which gives \\(x=0\\) or \\(\\log(x+1)-1=0\\). The latter gives \\(\\log(x+1)=1\\), or \\(x+1=10^{1}\\), which admits \\(x=9\\). We select test values \\(x\\) so that \\(x+1\\) is a power of \\(10\\), and we obtain \\(-1<-0.9<0<\\sqrt{10}-1<9<99\\). Our sign diagram gives the solution to be \\((-1,0]\\cup[9,\\infty)\\). The calculator indicates the graph of \\(y=f(x)=x\\log(x+1)\\) is above \\(y=g(x)=x\\) on the solution intervals, and the graphs intersect at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=9\\).\nOur next example revisits the concept of pH first seen in Exercise 77 in Section 6.1.\n**Example 6.4.3**.: In order to successfully breed Ippizuti fish the pH of a freshwater tank must be at least 7.8 but can be no more than 8.5. Determine the corresponding range of hydrogen ion concentration, and check your answer using a calculator.\n**Solution.** Recall from Exercise 77 in Section 6.1 that \\(\\mathrm{pH}=-\\log[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\) where \\([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\) is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per liter. We require \\(7.8\\leq-\\log[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\leq 8.5\\) or \\(-7.8\\geq\\log[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\geq-8.5\\). To solve this compound inequality we solve \\(-7.8\\geq\\log[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\) and \\(\\log[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\geq-8.5\\) and take the intersection of the solution sets.3 The former inequality yields \\(0<[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\leq 10^{-7.8}\\) and the latter yields \\([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\geq 10^{-8.5}\\). Taking the intersection gives us our final answer \\(10^{-8.5}\\leq[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\leq 10^{-7.8}\\). (Your Chemistry professor may want the answer written as \\(3.16\\times 10^{-9}\\leq[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]\\leq 1.58\\times 10^{-8}\\).) After carefully adjusting the viewing window on the graphing calculator we see that the graph of \\(f(x)=-\\log(x)\\) lies between the lines \\(y=7.8\\) and \\(y=8.5\\) on the interval \\([3.16\\times 10^{-9},1.58\\times 10^{-8}]\\).\n\n\n",

What is y(4)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nExample 17.1.6 Consider this specific example of an initial value problem for Newton's law of cooling: , . We first note that if , the right hand side of the differential equation is zero, and so the constant function is a solution to the differential equation. It is not a solution to the initial value problem, since . (The physical interpretation of this constant solution is that if a liquid is at the same temperature as its surroundings, then the liquid will stay at that temperature.)\n### First Order Differential Equations\nSo long as \\(y\\) is not 25, we can rewrite the differential equation as\n\\[\\eqalign{{dy\\over dt}{1\\over 25-y}&=2\\cr{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=2\\,dt,}\\]\nso\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy=\\int 2\\,dt,\\]\nthat is, the two anti-derivatives must be the same except for a constant difference. We can calculate these anti-derivatives and rearrange the results:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\nAs before, all solutions are represented by \\(y=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}\\), allowing \\(A\\) to be zero. \\(\\Box\\)\n**DEFINITION 17.1.8**: A first order differential equation is **separable** if it can be written in the form \\(\\dot{y}=f(t)g(y)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nAs in the examples, we can attempt to solve a separable equation by converting to the form\n\\[\\int{1\\over g(y)}\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nThis technique is called **separation of variables**. The simplest (in principle) sort of separable equation is one in which \\(g(y)=1\\), in which case we attempt to solve\n\\[\\int 1\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nWe can do this if we can find an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)\\).\nAlso as we have seen so far, a differential equation typically has an infinite number of solutions. Ideally, but certainly not always, a corresponding initial value problem will have just one solution. A solution in which there are no unknown constants remaining is called a **particular solution**.\nThe general approach to separable equations is this: Suppose we wish to solve \\(\\dot{y}=f(t)g(y)\\) where \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are continuous functions. If \\(g(a)=0\\) for some \\(a\\) then \\(y(t)=a\\) is a constant solution of the equation, since in this case \\(\\dot{y}=0=f(t)g(a)\\). For example, \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}-1\\) has constant solutions \\(y(t)=1\\) and \\(y(t)=-1\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**THEOREM 17.5.2** Given the differential equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\), \\(a\\neq 0\\), consider the quadratic polynomial \\(ax^{2}+bx+c\\), called the **characteristic polynomial**. Using the quadratic formula, this polynomial always has one or two roots, call them \\(r\\) and \\(s\\). The general solution of the differential equation is:\n**(a)**\\(y=Ae^{rt}+Be^{st}\\), if the roots \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are real numbers and \\(r\\neq s\\).\n**(b)**\\(y=Ae^{rt}+Bte^{rt}\\), if \\(r=s\\) is real.\n**(c)**\\(y=A\\cos(\\beta t)e^{\\alpha t}+B\\sin(\\beta t)e^{\\alpha t}\\), if the roots \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are complex numbers \\(\\alpha+\\beta i\\) and \\(\\alpha-\\beta i\\).\n### Second Order Homogeneous Equations\n##### Example 17.5.3\nSuppose a mass \\(m\\) is hung on a spring with spring constant \\(k\\). If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nOther physical systems that oscillate can also be described by such differential equations. Some electric circuits, for example, generate oscillating current.\n##### Example 17.5.4\nFind the solution to the intial value problem \\(\\ddot{y}-4\\dot{y}+4y=0\\), \\(y(0)=-3\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=1\\). The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}-4x+4=(x-2)^{2}\\), so there\nis one root, \\(r=2\\), and the general solution is \\(Ae^{2t}+Bte^{2t}\\). Substituting \\(t=0\\) we get \\(-3=A+0=A\\). The first derivative is \\(2Ae^{2t}+2Bte^{2t}+Be^{2t}\\); substituting \\(t=0\\) gives \\(1=2A+0+B=2A+B=2(-3)+B=-6+B\\), so \\(B=7\\). The solution is \\(-3e^{2t}+7te^{2t}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 17.5\n1.

Can we measure its integraion over the rectangle $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ using the Tonelli's Theorem? Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe rest of the points follow suit, and we connect them with the same basic shape as before. We confirm the domain of \\(g\\) is \\([0,\\infty)\\) and find the range of \\(g\\) to be \\([-1,\\infty)\\). 3. Solving \\(x-1\\geq 0\\) gives \\(x\\geq 1\\), so the domain of \\(j\\) is \\([1,\\infty)\\). To graph \\(j\\), we note that \\(j(x)=f(x-1)\\). In other words, we are subtracting \\(1\\) from the _input_ of \\(f\\). According to Theorem 1.3, this induces a shift to the right of the graph of \\(f\\). We add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) and get the result below. The graph reaffirms that the domain of \\(j\\) is \\([1,\\infty)\\) and tells us that the range of \\(j\\) is \\([0,\\infty)\\). 4. To find the domain of \\(m\\), we solve \\(x+3\\geq 0\\) and get \\([-3,\\infty)\\). Comparing the formulas of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(m(x)\\), we have \\(m(x)=f(x+3)-2\\). We have \\(3\\) being added to an input, indicating a horizontal shift, and \\(2\\) being subtracted from an output, indicating a vertical shift. We leave it to the reader to verify that, in this particular case, the order in which we perform these transformations is immaterial; we will arrive at the same graph regardless as to which transformation we apply first.2 We follow the convention 'inputs first',3 and to that end we first tackle the horizontal shift. Letting \\(m_{1}(x)=f(x+3)\\) denote this intermediate step, Theorem 1.3 tells us that the graph of \\(y=m_{1}(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) shifted to the left \\(3\\) units. Hence, we subtract \\(3\\) from each of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\). 3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSince \\(m(x)=f(x+3)-2\\) and \\(f(x+3)=m_{\\texttt{1}}(x)\\), we have \\(m(x)=m_{\\texttt{1}}(x)-2\\). We can apply Theorem 1.2 and obtain the graph of \\(m\\) by subtracting \\(2\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates of each of the points on the graph of \\(m_{\\texttt{1}}(x)\\). The graph verifies that the domain of \\(m\\) is \\([-3,\\infty)\\) and we find the range of \\(m\\) to be \\([-2,\\infty)\\).\nKeep in mind that we can check our answer to any of these kinds of problems by showing that any of the points we've moved lie on the graph of our final answer. For example, we can check that \\((-3,-2)\\) is on the graph of \\(m\\) by computing \\(m(-3)=\\sqrt{(-3)+3}-2=\\sqrt{0}-2=-2\\,\\checkmark\\)\nWe now turn our attention to reflections. We know from Section 1.1 that to reflect a point \\((x,y)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis, we replace \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\). If \\((x,y)\\) is on the graph of \\(f\\), then \\(y=f(x)\\), so replacing \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\) is the same as replacing \\(f(x)\\) with \\(-f(x)\\). Hence, the graph of \\(y=-f(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(x\\)-axis. Similarly, the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis. Returning to the language of inputs and outputs, multiplying the output from a function by \\(-1\\) reflects its graph across the \\(x\\)-axis, while multiplying the input to a function by \\(-1\\) reflects the graph across the \\(y\\)-axis.4\n**Theorem 1.4**.: **Reflections.** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function.\n* To graph \\(y=-f(x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\n* To graph \\(y=f(-x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\nApplying Theorem 1.4 to the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) given at the beginning of the section, we can graph \\(y=-f(x)\\) by reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis\nBy reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis, we obtain the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\).\nWith the addition of reflections, it is now more important than ever to consider the order of transformations, as the next example illustrates.\n**Example 1.7.2**.: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Use the graph of \\(f\\) from Example 1.7.1 to graph the following functions. Also, state their domains and ranges.\n1. \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{-x}\\) 2. \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{3-x}\\) 3. \\(m(x)=3-\\sqrt{x}\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. The mere sight of \\(\\sqrt{-x}\\) usually causes alarm, if not panic. When we discussed domains in Section 1.4, we clearly banished negatives from the radicands of even roots. However, we must remember that \\(x\\) is a variable, and as such, the quantity \\(-x\\) isn't always negative. For example, if \\(x=-4\\), \\(-x=4\\), thus \\(\\sqrt{-x}=\\sqrt{-(-4)}=2\\) is perfectly well-defined. To find the domain analytically, we set \\(-x\\geq 0\\) which gives \\(x\\leq 0\\), so that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,0]\\). Since \\(g(x)=f(-x)\\), Theorem 1.4 tells us that the graph of \\(g\\) is the reflection of the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis. We accomplish this by multiplying each \\(x\\)-coordinate on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\), so that the points \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,1)\\), and \\((4,2)\\) move to \\((0,0)\\), \\((-1,1)\\), and \\((-4,2)\\), respectively. Graphically, we see that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,0]\\) and the range of \\(g\\) is the same as the range of \\(f\\), namely \\([0,\\infty)\\). 2. To determine the domain of \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{3-x}\\), we solve \\(3-x\\geq 0\\) and get \\(x\\leq 3\\), or \\((-\\infty,3]\\). To determine which transformations we need to apply to the graph of \\(f\\) to obtain the graph of \\(j\\), we rewrite \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{-x+3}=f(-x+3)\\). Comparing this formula with \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we see that not only are we multiplying the input \\(x\\) by \\(-1\\), which results in a reflection across the \\(y\\)-axis, but also we are adding \\(3\\), which indicates a horizontal shift to the left. Does it matter in which order we do the transformations? If so, which order is the correct order? Let's consider the point \\((4,2)\\) on the graph of \\(f\\). We refer to the discussion leading up to Theorem 1.3. We know \\(f(4)=2\\) and wish to find the point on \\(y=j(x)=f(-x+3)\\) which corresponds to \\((4,2)\\). We set \\(-x+3=4\\) and solve. Our first step is to subtract \\(3\\) from both sides to get \\(-x=1\\). Subtracting \\(3\\) from the \\(x\\)-coordinate \\(4\\) is shifting the point \\((4,2)\\) to the left. From \\(-x=1\\), we then multiply5 both sides by \\(-1\\) to get \\(x=-1\\). Multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinate by \\(-1\\) corresponds to reflecting the point about the \\(y\\)-axis. Hence, we perform the horizontal shift first, then follow it with the reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. Starting with \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we let \\(j_{1}(x)\\) be the intermediate function which shifts the graph of \\(f\\)\\(3\\) units to the left, \\(j_{1}(x)=f(x+3)\\). Footnote 5: Or divide - it amounts to the same thing.\nTo obtain the function \\(j\\), we reflect the graph of \\(j_{1}\\) about \\(y\\)-axis. Theorem 1.4 tells us we have \\(j(x)=j_{1}(-x)\\). Putting it all together, we have \\(j(x)=j_{1}(-x)=f(-x+3)=\\sqrt{-x+3}\\), which is what we want.6 From the graph, we confirm the domain of \\(j\\) is \\((-\\infty,3]\\) and we get that the range is \\([0,\\infty)\\). Footnote 6: If we had done the reflection first, then \\(j_{1}(x)=f(-x)\\). Following this by a shift left would give us \\(j(x)=j_{1}(x+3)=f(-(x+3))=f(-x-3)=\\sqrt{-x-3}\\) which isn’t what we want. However, if we did the reflection first and followed it by a shift to the right 3 units, we would have arrived at the function \\(j(x)\\). We leave it to the reader to verify the details.\n\n\n",

Our purpose is to derive a relation between the angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) your path makes with the perpendicular to the side of the pool when you're on land, and the angle \\(\\theta_{2}\\) your path makes with the perpendicular when you're in the water.

A \"related rates\" problem is a problem in which we know one of the rates of change at a given instant--say,\nFigure 6.1.7: Wading pool rescue.\n\\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\)--and we want to find the other rate \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\) at that instant. (The use of \\(\\dot{x}\\) to mean \\(dx/dt\\) goes back to Newton and is still used for this purpose, especially by physicists.)\nIf \\(y\\) is written in terms of \\(x\\), i.e., \\(y=f(x)\\), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n**1.**: Decide what the two variables are.\n**2.**: Find an equation relating them.\n**3.**: Take \\(d/dt\\) of both sides.\n**4.**: Plug in all known values at the instant in question.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1.

If \\({\\bf F}\\) is a conservative force field, then the integral for work, \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\), is in the form required by the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals. This means that in a conservative force field, the amount of work required to move an object from point \\({\\bf a}\\) to point \\({\\bf b}\\) depends only on those points, not on the path taken between them.\n**Example 16.3.2**: An object moves in the force field\n\\[{\\bf F}=\\left\\langle\\frac{-x}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-y}{(x^{2}+y^{ 2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-z}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}}\\right\\rangle,\\]\nalong the curve \\({\\bf r}=\\langle 1+t,t^{3},t\\cos(\\pi t)\\rangle\\) as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Find the work done by the force on the object.\nThe straightforward way to do this involves substituting the components of \\({\\bf r}\\) into \\({\\bf F}\\), forming the dot product \\({\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\), and then trying to compute the integral, but this integral is extraordinarily messy, perhaps impossible to compute. But since \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla(1/\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}})\\) we need only substitute:\n\\[\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\left.\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right| _{(1,0,0)}^{(2,1,-1)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}-1.\\]\n### The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals\nAnother immediate consequence of the Fundamental Theorem involves **closed paths**. A path \\(C\\) is closed if it forms a loop, so that traveling over the \\(C\\) curve brings you back to the starting point. If \\(C\\) is a closed path, we can integrate around it starting at any point \\({\\bf a}\\); since the starting and ending points are the same,\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=f({\\bf a})-f({\\bf a})=0.\\]\nFor example, in a gravitational field (an inverse square law field) the amount of work required to move an object around a closed path is zero. Of course, it's only the _net_ amount of work that is zero. It may well take a great deal of work to get from point \\({\\bf a}\\) to point \\({\\bf b}\\), but then the return trip will \"produce\" work. For example, it takes work to pump water from a lower to a higher elevation, but if you then let gravity pull the water back down, you can recover work by running a water wheel or generator. (In the real world you won't recover all the work because of various losses along the way.)\nTo make use of the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, we need to be able to spot conservative vector fields \\({\\bf F}\\) and to compute \\(f\\) so that \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla f\\). Suppose that \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle=\\nabla f\\). Then \\(P=f_{x}\\) and \\(Q=f_{y}\\), and provided that \\(f\\) is sufficiently nice, we know from Clairaut's Theorem (14.6.2) that \\(P_{y}=f_{xy}=f_{yx}=Q_{x}\\). If we compute \\(P_{y}\\) and \\(Q_{x}\\) and find that they are not equal, then \\({\\bf F}\\) is not conservative. If \\(P_{y}=Q_{x}\\), then, again provided that \\({\\bf F}\\) is sufficiently nice, we can be assured that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative. Ultimately, what's important is that we be able to find \\(f\\); as this amounts to finding anti-derivatives, we may not always succeed.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe surface integral must be separated into six parts, one for each face of the cube. One face is \\(z=0\\) or \\({\\bf r}=\\langle u,v,0\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq u,v\\leq 1\\). Then \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,0,1\\rangle\\). We need this to be oriented downward (out of the cube), so we use \\(\\langle 0,0,-1\\rangle\\) and the corresponding integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}-z^{2}\\,du\\,dv=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}0\\,du\\,dv=0.\\]\nAnother face is \\(y=1\\) or \\({\\bf r}=\\langle u,1,v\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,0,1\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-1,0\\rangle\\). We need a normal in the positive \\(y\\) direction, so we convert this to \\(\\langle 0,1,0\\rangle\\), and the corresponding integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}3y\\,du\\,dv=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}3\\,du\\,dv=3.\\]\nThe remaining four integrals have values 0, 0, 2, and 1, and the sum of these is 6, in agreement with the triple integral.\n**Example 16.9.3** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle x^{3},y^{3},z^{2}\\rangle\\), and consider the cylindrical volume \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 9\\), \\(0\\leq z\\leq 2\\).

Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\nwe don't have to worry about it ever again. When we say that \\(x\\) might be \"complicated\" we really mean that in practice it might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:\n**Theorem 2.3.5** Suppose \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\). Then\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\n_Proof._ We have to use the official definition of limit to make sense of this. So given any \\(\\epsilon\\) we need to find a \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|f(x)g(x)-LM|<\\epsilon\\). What do we have to work with? We know that we can make \\(f(x)\\) close to \\(L\\) and \\(g(x)\\) close to \\(M\\), and we have to somehow connect these facts to make \\(f(x)g(x)\\) close to \\(LM\\).\nWe use, as is so often the case, a little algebraic trick:\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&=|f(x)g(x)-f(x)M+f(x)M-LM|\\cr&=|f(x)(g(x)-M)+(f(x)-L)M| \\cr&\\leq|f(x)(g(x)-M)|+|(f(x)-L)M|\\cr&=|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|.\\cr}\\]\nThis is all straightforward except perhaps for the \"\\(\\leq\\)\". That is an example of the **triangle inequality**, which says that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers then \\(|a+b|\\leq|a|+|b|\\). If you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.\nSince \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\), there is a value \\(\\delta_{1}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{1}\\) implies \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), This means that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{1}\\) implies \\(|f(x)-L||M|<\\epsilon/2\\). You can see where this is going: if we can make \\(|f(x)||g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/2\\) also, then we'll be done.\nWe can make \\(|g(x)-M|\\) smaller than any fixed number by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\); unfortunately, \\(\\epsilon/(2f(x))\\) is not a fixed number, since \\(x\\) is a variable. Here we need another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing \\(x^{2}\\). We can find a \\(\\delta_{2}\\) so that \\(|x-a|<\\delta_{2}\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<1\\), meaning that \\(L-1<f(x)<L+1\\). This means that \\(|f(x)|<N\\), where \\(N\\) is either \\(|L-1|\\) or \\(|L+1|\\), depending on whether \\(L\\) is negative or positive. The important point is that \\(N\\) doesn't depend on \\(x\\). Finally, we know that there is a \\(\\delta_{3}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{3}\\) implies \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Now we're ready to put everything together. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the smallest of \\(\\delta_{1}\\), \\(\\delta_{2}\\), and \\(\\delta_{3}\\). Then \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), \\(|f(x)|<N\\), and \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Then\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSuppose we want the derivative of \\(f(g(x))\\). Again, let's set up the derivative and play some algebraic tricks:\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}f(g(x))&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x+\\Delta x))-f(g(x)) \\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x+\\Delta x))-f(g(x))\\over g(x+\\Delta x )-g(x)}{g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\over\\Delta x}}\\]\nNow we see immediately that the second fraction turns into \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) when we take the limit. The first fraction is more complicated, but it too looks something like a derivative. The denominator, \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\), is a change in the value of \\(g\\), so let's abbreviate it as \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\), which also means \\(g(x+\\Delta x)=g(x)+\\Delta g\\). This gives us\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(g(x)+\\Delta g)-f(g(x))\\over\\Delta g}.\\]\nAs \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to 0, it is also true that \\(\\Delta g\\) goes to 0, because \\(g(x+\\Delta x)\\) goes to \\(g(x)\\). So we can rewrite this limit as\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta g\\to 0}{f(g(x)+\\Delta g)-f(g(x))\\over\\Delta g}.\\]\nNow this looks exactly like a derivative, namely \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\), that is, the function \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g(x)\\). If this all withstands scrutiny, we then get\n\\[{d\\over dx}f(g(x))=f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x).\\]\nUnfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what we mean by \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\) involves what happens when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 _but not equal to 0_. The qualification is very important, since we must be able to divide by \\(\\Delta x\\). But when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 but not equal to 0, \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x))-g(x)\\) is close to 0 _and possibly equal to 0_. This means it doesn't really make sense to divide by \\(\\Delta g\\). Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to avoid this difficulty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details, which can be found in many calculus books. Note that many functions \\(g\\) do have the property that \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\neq 0\\) when \\(\\Delta x\\) is small, and for these functions the argument above is fine.\nThe chain rule has a particularly simple expression if we use the Leibniz notation for the derivative. The quantity \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\) is the derivative of \\(f\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g\\); this can be written \\(df/dg\\). As usual, \\(g^{\\prime}(x)=dg/dx\\). Then the chain rule becomes\n\\[{df\\over dx}={df\\over dg}{dg\\over dx}.\\]\nThis looks like trivial arithmetic, but it is not: \\(dg/dx\\) is not a fraction, that is, not literal division, but a single symbol that means \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Nevertheless, it turns out that what looks like trivial arithmetic, and is therefore easy to remember, is really true.\nIt will take a bit of practice to make the use of the chain rule come naturally--it is more complicated than the earlier differentiation rules we have seen.\n**Example 3.5.2**.: Compute the derivative of \\(\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\). We already know that the answer is \\(-x/\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\), computed directly from the limit. In the context of the chain rule, we have \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), \\(g(x)=625-x^{2}\\). We know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=(1/2)x^{-1/2}\\), so \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))=(1/2)(625-x^{2})^{-1/2}\\). Note that this is a two step computation: first compute \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\), then replace \\(x\\) by \\(g(x)\\). Since \\(g^{\\prime}(x)=-2x\\) we have\n\\[f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x)={1\\over 2\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}}(-2x)={-x\\over\\sqrt{625 -x^{2}}}.\\]\n**Example 3.5.3**.: Compute the derivative of \\(1/\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\). This is a quotient with a constant numerator, so we could use the quotient rule, but it is simpler to use the chain\n\n\n",

An obvious guess for the derivative of \\(f\\) is the product of the derivatives of the constituent functions: \\((2x)(3x^{2}-3)=6x^{3}-6x\\). Is this correct? We can easily check, by rewriting \\(f\\) and doing the calculation in a way that is known to work. First, \\(f(x)=x^{5}-3x^{3}+x^{3}-3x=x^{5}-2x^{3}-3x\\), and then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=5x^{4}-6x^{2}-3\\). Not even close! What went \"wrong\"? Well, nothing really, except the guess was wrong.\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\nReturning to the example we started with, let \\(f(x)=(x^{2}+1)(x^{3}-3x)\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=(x^{2}+1)(3x^{2}-3)+(2x)(x^{3}-3x)=3x^{4}-3x^{2}+3x^{2}-3+2x^{4} -6x^{2}=5x^{4}-6x^{2}-3\\), as before. In this case it is probably simpler to multiply \\(f(x)\\) out first, then compute the derivative; here's an example for which we really need the product rule.\n**EXAMPLE 3.3.1** Compute the derivative of \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\).

When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well. So along every line through the origin \\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(0\\). Now suppose we approach the origin along \\(x=y^{2}\\). Then\n\\[f(x,y)={y^{2}y^{2}\\over y^{4}+y^{4}}={y^{4}\\over 2y^{4}}={1\\over 2},\\]\nso the limit is \\(1/2\\). Looking at figure 14.2.1, it is apparent that there is a ridge above \\(x=y^{2}\\). Approaching the origin along a straight line, we go over the ridge and then drop down toward \\(0\\), but approaching along the ridge the height is a constant \\(1/2\\). Thus, there is no limit at \\((0,0)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFortunately, we can define the concept of limit without needing to specify how a particular point is approached--indeed, in definition 2.3.2, we didn't need the concept of \"approach.\" Roughly, that definition says that when \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\) then \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\); there is no mention of \"how\" we get close to \\(a\\). We can adapt that definition to two variables quite easily:\n**DEFINITION 14.2.2** Limit Suppose \\(f(x,y)\\) is a function. We say that\n\\[\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\]\nif for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}}<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.1**\\(f(x,y)=\\frac{xy^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{4}}\\) (AP)\nThis says that we can make \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\), no matter how small \\(\\epsilon\\) is, by making the distance from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((a,b)\\) \"small enough\".\n**Example 14.2.3** We show that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}=0\\). Suppose \\(\\epsilon>0\\). Then\n\\[\\left|\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|=\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|.\\]\nNote that \\(x^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\leq 1\\) and \\(|y|=\\sqrt{y^{2}}\\leq\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}<\\delta\\). So\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot\\delta.\\]\nWe want to force this to be less than \\(\\epsilon\\) by picking \\(\\delta\\) \"small enough.\" If we choose \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/3\\) then\n\\[\\left|{3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot{\\epsilon\\over 3}=\\epsilon.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\); roughly this says that there is no \"hole\" or \"jump\" at \\(x=a\\). We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n**THEOREM 14.2.6** Polynomials are continuous everywhere.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nFind the arc length of the curve, where x=t, y=t^2 and z=2*t^3/3.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWe have already seen how to compute slopes of curves given by parametric equations--it is how we computed slopes in polar coordinates.\n##### Example 10.5.1\nFind the slope of the cycloid \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\). We compute \\(x^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\), \\(y^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{\\sin t}{1-\\cos t}.\\]\nNote that when \\(t\\) is an odd multiple of \\(\\pi\\), like \\(\\pi\\) or \\(3\\pi\\), this is \\((0/2)=0\\), so there is a horizontal tangent line, in agreement with figure 10.4.1. At even multiples of \\(\\pi\\), the fraction is \\(0/0\\), which is undefined. The figure shows that there is no tangent line at such points. \\(\\Box\\)\nAreas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on the curve and the area desired. We can potentially compute areas between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis quite easily.\n##### Example 10.5.2\nFind the area under one arch of the cycloid \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\). We would like to compute\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y\\;dx,\\]\nbut we do not know \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\). However, the parametric equations allow us to make a substitution: use \\(y=1-\\cos t\\) to replace \\(y\\), and compute \\(dx=(1-\\cos t)\\;dt\\). Then the integral becomes\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(1-\\cos t)(1-\\cos t)\\;dt=3\\pi.\\]\nFigure 10.4.4: An involute of a circle.\n### Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations\nNote that we need to convert the original \\(x\\) limits to \\(t\\) limits using \\(x=t-\\sin t\\). When \\(x=0\\), \\(t=\\sin t\\), which happens only when \\(t=0\\). Likewise, when \\(x=2\\pi\\), \\(t-2\\pi=\\sin t\\) and \\(t=2\\pi\\). Alternately, because we understand how the cycloid is produced, we can see directly that one arch is generated by \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\). In general, of course, the \\(t\\) limits will be different than the \\(x\\) limits. \\(\\Box\\)\nThis technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas, as illustrated by the exercises.\nAs a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric equations. Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), and develops the formula for length:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx.\\]\nUsing some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use parametric equations \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx&=\\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;\\frac{dt}{dx}\\;dx\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2}}\\;dt\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v} \\sqrt{(f^{\\prime}(t))^{2}+(g^{\\prime}(t))^{2}}\\;dt.}\\]\nHere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the \\(t\\) limits corresponding to the \\(x\\) limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n**EXAMPLE 10.5.3** Find the length of one arch of the cycloid. From \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\), we get the derivatives \\(f^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so the length is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{(1-\\cos t)^{2}+\\sin^{2}t}\\;dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{2-2 \\cos t}\\;dt.\\]\nNow we use the formula \\(\\sin^{2}(t/2)=(1-\\cos(t))/2\\) or \\(4\\sin^{2}(t/2)=2-2\\cos t\\) to get\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{4\\sin^{2}(t/2)}\\;dt.\\]\nSince \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\), \\(\\sin(t/2)\\geq 0\\), so we can rewrite this as\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}2\\sin(t/2)\\;dt=8.\\]\n### 10.5 Calculus with Parametric Equations\nExercises 10.5.1: Consider the curve of exercise 6 in section 10.4. Find all values of \\(t\\) for which the curve has a horizontal tangent line. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nConsider the curve of exercise 6 in section 10.4.

Set up an integral for the length of one arch of the curve. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nConsider the hypercycloid of exercise 7 in section 10.4. Find all points at which the curve has a horizontal tangent line. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow we need to write a formula for the sum of the lengths of the line segments, in a form that we know becomes an integral in the limit. So we suppose we have divided the interval \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals as usual, each with length \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), and endpoints \\(a=x_{0}\\), \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), ..., \\(x_{n}=b\\). The length of a typical line segment, joining \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\) to \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), is \\(\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^{2}+(f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i}))^{2}}\\). By the Mean Value Theorem (6.5.2), there is a number \\(t_{i}\\) in \\((x_{i},x_{i+1})\\) such that \\(f^{\\prime}(t_{i})\\Delta x=f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i})\\), so the length of\nFigure 9.1: The length of a line segment.\nthe line segment can be written as\n\\[\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^{2}+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i}))^{2}\\Delta x^{2}}=\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i }))^{2}}\\,\\Delta x.\\]\nThe arc length is then\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i}))^{2}}\\,\\Delta x= \\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nNote that the sum looks a bit different than others we have encountered, because the approximation contains a \\(t_{i}\\) instead of an \\(x_{i}\\). In the past we have always used left endpoints (namely, \\(x_{i}\\)) to get a representative value of \\(f\\) on \\([x_{i},x_{i+1}]\\); now we are using a different point, but the principle is the same.\nTo summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval \\([a,b]\\), we compute the integral\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, integrals of this form are typically difficult or impossible to compute exactly, because usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work. In practice this means that the integral will usually have to be approximated.\nLet \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\), the upper half circle of radius \\(r\\). The length of this curve is half the circumference, namely \\(\\pi r\\). Let's compute this with the arc length formula. The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is \\(-x/\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) so the integral is\n\\[\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{x^{2}}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx=\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{r ^{2}}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx=r\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx.\\]\nUsing a trigonometric substitution, we find the antiderivative, namely \\(\\arcsin(x/r)\\). Notice that the integral is improper at both endpoints, as the function \\(\\sqrt{1/(r^{2}-x^{2})}\\) is undefined\nFigure 9.2: Approximating arc length with line segments.\n### Chapter 9 Applications of Integration\nwhen \\(x=\\pm r\\). So we need to compute\n\\[\\lim_{D\\to-r^{+}}\\int_{D}^{0}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx+\\lim_{D\\to r^{-}} \\int_{0}^{D}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx.\\]\nThis is not difficult, and has value \\(\\pi\\), so the original integral, with the extra \\(r\\) in front, has value \\(\\pi r\\) as expected. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 9.9.\n1.

It also never exceeds the value 1 or drops below the value 0. Because the graph never increases or decreases without bound, we say that the function represented by the graph in (c) is a **bounded** function.\n### Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative\n**DEFINITION 2.5.1 Bounded** A function \\(f\\) is bounded if there is a number \\(M\\) such that \\(|f(x)|<M\\) for every \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFor the function in (c), one such choice for \\(M\\) would be \\(10\\). However, the smallest (optimal) choice would be \\(M=1\\). In either case, simply finding an \\(M\\) is enough to establish boundedness. No such \\(M\\) exists for the hyperbola in (d) and hence we say that it is **unbounded**.\n**Continuity.** The graphs shown in (b) and (c) both represent **continuous** functions. Geometrically, this is because there are no jumps in the graphs. That is, if you pick a point on the graph and approach it from the left and right, the values of the function approach the value of the function at that point. For example, we can see that this is not true for function values near \\(x=-1\\) on the graph in (a) which is not continuous at that location.\nFigure 2.5.1: Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c) a bounded, differentiable function, (d) an unbounded, differentiable function\n**Definition 2.5.2**: **Continuous at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.3**: **Continuous** A function \\(f\\) is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. \\(\\Box\\)\nStrangely, we also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n**Definition 2.5.4**: **Differentiable at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable at point \\(a\\) if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) exists. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.5**: **Differentiable** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable if is differentiable at every point (excluding endpoints and isolated points in the domain of \\(f\\)) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTake note that, for technical reasons not discussed here, both of these definitions exclude endpoints and isolated points in the domain from consideration.\nWe close with a useful theorem about continuous functions:\n**Theorem 2.5.6**: **Intermediate Value Theorem** If \\(f\\) is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\) and \\(d\\) is between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\), then there is a number \\(c\\) in \\([a,b]\\) such that \\(f(c)=d\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\nThis is most frequently used when \\(d=0\\).\n**Example 2.5.7**: **Explain why the function \\(f=x^{3}+3x^{2}+x-2\\) has a root between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 14.2.1** Consider \\(f(x,y)=xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\). When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well. So along every line through the origin \\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(0\\). Now suppose we approach the origin along \\(x=y^{2}\\). Then\n\\[f(x,y)={y^{2}y^{2}\\over y^{4}+y^{4}}={y^{4}\\over 2y^{4}}={1\\over 2},\\]\nso the limit is \\(1/2\\). Looking at figure 14.2.1, it is apparent that there is a ridge above \\(x=y^{2}\\). Approaching the origin along a straight line, we go over the ridge and then drop down toward \\(0\\), but approaching along the ridge the height is a constant \\(1/2\\). Thus, there is no limit at \\((0,0)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFortunately, we can define the concept of limit without needing to specify how a particular point is approached--indeed, in definition 2.3.2, we didn't need the concept of \"approach.\" Roughly, that definition says that when \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\) then \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\); there is no mention of \"how\" we get close to \\(a\\). We can adapt that definition to two variables quite easily:\n**DEFINITION 14.2.2** Limit Suppose \\(f(x,y)\\) is a function. We say that\n\\[\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\]\nif for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}}<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.1**\\(f(x,y)=\\frac{xy^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{4}}\\) (AP)\nThis says that we can make \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\), no matter how small \\(\\epsilon\\) is, by making the distance from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((a,b)\\) \"small enough\".\n**Example 14.2.3** We show that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}=0\\). Suppose \\(\\epsilon>0\\). Then\n\\[\\left|\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|=\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|.\\]\nNote that \\(x^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\leq 1\\) and \\(|y|=\\sqrt{y^{2}}\\leq\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}<\\delta\\). So\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot\\delta.\\]\nWe want to force this to be less than \\(\\epsilon\\) by picking \\(\\delta\\) \"small enough.\" If we choose \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/3\\) then\n\\[\\left|{3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot{\\epsilon\\over 3}=\\epsilon.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\); roughly this says that there is no \"hole\" or \"jump\" at \\(x=a\\). We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n**THEOREM 14.2.6** Polynomials are continuous everywhere. Rational functions are continuous everywhere they are defined.\n_Exercises 14.2._\nDetermine whether each limit exists.

This works if between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) the segment of curve is traced out exactly once.)\n##### Example 13.3.1\nLet's find the length of one turn of the helix \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\) (see figure 13.1.1). We compute \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}|=\\sqrt{\\sin^{2}t+\\cos^{2}t+1}=\\sqrt{2}\\), so the length is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{2}\\,dt=2\\sqrt{2}\\pi.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\n##### Example 13.3.2\nSuppose \\(y=\\ln x\\); what is the length of this curve between \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=\\sqrt{3}\\)?\nAlthough this problem does not appear to involve vectors or three dimensions, we can interpret it in those terms: let \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle t,\\ln t,0\\rangle\\). This vector function traces out precisely \\(y=\\ln x\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle 1,1/t,0\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+1/t^{2}}\\) and the desired length is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{t^{2}}}\\,dt=2-\\sqrt{2}+\\ln(\\sqrt{2}+1)- \\frac{1}{2}\\ln 3.\\]\n(This integral is a bit tricky, but requires only methods we have learned.) \\(\\Box\\)\nNotice that there is nothing special about \\(y=\\ln x\\), except that the resulting integral can be computed. In general, given any \\(y=f(x)\\), we can think of this as the vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle t,f(t),0\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle 1,f^{\\prime}(t),0\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime})^{2}}\\). The length of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is thus\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, such integrals are often impossible to do exactly and must be approximated.\nOne useful application of arc length is the **arc length parameterization**. A vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) gives the position of a point in terms of the parameter \\(t\\), which is often time, but need not be. Suppose \\(s\\) is the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use \\(s\\) for the variable, we get \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), the position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has traveled.\n##### Example 13.3.3\nSuppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\). We know that this curve is a circle of radius 1. While \\(t\\) might represent time, it can also in this case represent the usual angle between the positive \\(x\\)-axis and \\({\\bf r}(t)\\). The distance along the circle from \\((1,0,0)\\) to\n\\((\\cos t,\\sin t,0)\\) is also \\(t\\)--this is the definition of radian measure. Thus, in this case \\(s=t\\) and \\({\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos s,\\sin s,0\\rangle\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\n**Example 13.3.4** Suppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\). We know that this curve is a helix. The distance along the helix from \\((1,0,0)\\) to \\((\\cos t,\\sin t,t)\\) is\n\\[s=\\int_{0}^{t}|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(u)|\\,du=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u+\\sin^{2}u+ 1}\\,du=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sqrt{2}\\,du=\\sqrt{2}t.\\]\nThus, the value of \\(t\\) that gets us distance \\(s\\) along the helix is \\(t=s/\\sqrt{2}\\), and so the same curve is given by \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2}),\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2}),s/\\sqrt{2}\\rangle\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nIn general, if we have a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), to convert it to a vector function in terms of arc length we compute\n\\[s=\\int_{a}^{t}|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(u)|\\,du=f(t),\\]\nsolve \\(s=f(t)\\) for \\(t\\), getting \\(t=g(s)\\), and substitute this back into \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) to get \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)={\\bf r}(g(s))\\).\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nDoes \\lim_{x \\to 0} (cos(mx - 1)/(x^2) = -(m^2)/2 for m = 2?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\nTo compute the desired limit it is sufficient to compute the limits of the two final fractions, as \\(x\\) goes to 0. The first of these is the hard limit we've just done, namely 1. The second turns out to be simple, because the denominator presents no problem:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\sin 0}{\\cos 0+1}=\\frac{0}{2}=0.\\]\nThus,\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\nguarantees that \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? Of course: no matter what \\(\\epsilon\\) is, \\(\\delta=\\epsilon\\) works. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it turns out to be very easy to prove something \"obvious,\" which is nice. It doesn't take long before things get trickier, however.\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\nThis has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:\nProof that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Given any \\(\\epsilon\\), pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Then when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), \\(|x+2|<5\\) and \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\n\n\n",

We resist the temptation to divide both sides of \\(3\\sin^{3}(x)=\\sin^{2}(x)\\) by \\(\\sin^{2}(x)\\) (What goes wrong if you do?) and instead gather all of the terms to one side of the equation and factor. \\[3\\sin^{3}(x) = \\sin^{2}(x)\\] \\[3\\sin^{3}(x)-\\sin^{2}(x) = 0\\] \\[\\sin^{2}(x)(3\\sin(x)-1) = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Factor out $\\sin^{2}(x)$ from both terms}.\\] We get \\(\\sin^{2}(x)=0\\) or \\(3\\sin(x)-1=0\\). Solving for \\(\\sin(x)\\), we find \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\). The solution to the first equation is \\(x=\\pi k\\), with \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) being the two solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To solve \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we use the arcsine function to get \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We find the two solutions here which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) to be \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\). To check graphically, we plot \\(y=3(\\sin(x))^{3}\\) and \\(y=(\\sin(x))^{2}\\) and find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of these two curves. Some extra zooming is required near \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) to verify that these two curves do in fact intersect four times.6 Footnote 6: Note that we are _not_ counting the point \\((2\\pi,0)\\) in our solution set since \\(x=2\\pi\\) is not in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\). In the forthcoming solutions, remember that while \\(x=2\\pi\\) may be a solution to the equation, it isn’t counted among the solutions in \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n2. Analysis of \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=\\tan(x)+3\\) reveals two different trigonometric functions, so an identity is in order. Since \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)\\), we get \\[\\sec^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\] \\[1+\\tan^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\quad\\text{(Since $\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)$.)}\\] \\[\\tan^{2}(x)-\\tan(x)-2 = 0\\] \\[u^{2}-u-2 = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Let $u=\\tan(x)$.}\\] \\[(u+1)(u-2) = 0\\]\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n4. To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSubstituting these \\(x\\)-values into \\(g(x)\\), we generate the graph below and find the period to be \\(1-(-1)=2\\). The associated sine curve, \\(y=\\frac{\\sin(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\), is dotted in as a reference.\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) as read from the graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.\nThe properties of the tangent and cotangent functions are summarized below. As with Theorem 10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.\n**Theorem 10.25**. **Properties of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions**\n\n\n",

The second derivative \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|\\) incorporates this notion of time, so it depends not simply on the geometric properties of the curve but on how quickly we move along the curve.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.5** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf s}(t)=\\langle\\cos 2t,\\sin 2t,0\\rangle\\). Both of these vector functions represent the unit circle in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, but if \\(t\\) is interpreted as time, the second describes an object moving twice as fast as the first. Computing the second derivatives, we find \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=1\\), \\(|{\\bf s}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=4\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nTo remove the dependence on time, we use the arc length parameterization. If a curve is given by \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), then the first derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit vector, that is, \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}(s)\\). We now compute the second derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)\\) and use \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)|\\) as the \"official\" measure of **curvature**, usually denoted \\(\\kappa\\).\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.6** We have seen that the arc length parameterization of a particular helix is \\({\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2}),\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2}),s/\\sqrt{2}\\rangle\\). Computing the second derivative gives \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)=\\langle-\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,-\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,0\\rangle\\) with length \\(1/2\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nWhat if we are given a curve as a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is not arc length? We have seen that arc length can be difficult to compute; fortunately, we do not need to convert to the arc length parameterization to compute curvature. Instead, let us imagine that we have done this, so we have found \\(t=g(s)\\) and then formed \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)={\\bf r}(g(s))\\). The first derivative \\(\\hat{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit tangent vector, so it is the same as the unit tangent vector \\({\\bf T}(t)={\\bf T}(g(s))\\). Taking the derivative of this we get\n\\[{d\\over ds}{\\bf T}(g(s))={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(g(s))g^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime} (t){dt\\over ds}.\\]\nThe curvature is the length of this vector:\n\\[\\kappa=|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)||{dt\\over ds}|={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|ds/dt|} ={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}.\\]\n(Recall that we have seen that \\(ds/dt=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\).) Thus we can compute the curvature by computing only derivatives with respect to \\(t\\); we do not need to do the conversion to arc length.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.7** Returning to the helix, suppose we start with the parameterization \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{2}\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}\\). Then \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\cos t,-\\sin t,0\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1/\\sqrt{2}\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=1/2\\), as before.\n### 13.3 Arc length and curvature\n**Example 13.3.8** Consider this circle of radius \\(a\\): \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle a\\cos t,a\\sin t,1\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=a\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle/a\\). Now \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\cos t,-a\\sin t,0\\rangle/a\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/a\\): the curvature of a circle is everywhere the reciprocal of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous example is \\(1/2\\); this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius \\(2\\), as shown in figure 13.3.1.\n**Figure 13.3.1** A circle with the same curvature as the helix. (AP)\n**Example 13.3.9** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,\\cos 2t\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 13.2.4. \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,-2\\sin(2t)\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}\\), so\n\\[{\\bf T}(t)=\\left\\langle\\frac{-\\sin t}{\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}},\\frac{\\cos t}{ \\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}},\\frac{-2\\sin 2t}{\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}}\\right\\rangle.\\]\nComputing the derivative of this and then the length of the resulting vector is possible but unpleasant.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 13.4 Motion along a curve\n#### Exercises 13.3.\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle 3\\cos t,2t,3\\sin t\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,2\\pi]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle t^{2},2,t^{3}\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,1]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle t^{2},\\sin t,\\cos t\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,1]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of the curve \\(y=x^{3/2}\\), \\(x\\in[1,9]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Set up an integral to compute the length of \\(\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,e^{t}\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,5]\\). (It is tedious but not too difficult to compute this integral.) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the curvature of \\(\\langle t,t^{2},t\\rangle\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the curvature of \\(\\langle t,t^{2},t^{2}\\rangle\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the curvature of \\(\\langle t,t^{2},t^{3}\\rangle\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the curvature of \\(y=x^{4}\\) at \\((1,1)\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n### 13.4 Motion along a curve\nWe have already seen that if \\(t\\) is time and an object's location is given by \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), then the derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)\\) is the velocity vector \\({\\bf v}(t)\\). Just as \\({\\bf v}(t)\\) is a vector describing how \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) changes, so is \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(t)\\) a vector describing how \\({\\bf v}(t)\\) changes, namely, \\({\\bf a}(t)={\\bf v}^{\\prime}(t)={\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)\\) is the **acceleration vector**.\n#### Example 13.4.1\nSuppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,1\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf v}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf a}(t)=\\langle-\\cos t,-\\sin t,0\\rangle\\). This describes the motion of an object traveling on a circle of radius 1, with constant \\(z\\) coordinate 1. The velocity vector is of course tangent to the curve; note that \\({\\bf a}\\cdot{\\bf v}=0\\), so \\({\\bf v}\\) and \\({\\bf a}\\) are perpendicular. In fact, it is not hard to see that \\({\\bf a}\\) points from the location of the object to the center of the circular path at \\((0,0,1)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that the unit tangent vector is given by \\({\\bf T}(t)={\\bf v}(t)/|{\\bf v}(t)|\\), so \\({\\bf v}=|{\\bf v}|{\\bf T}\\). If we take the derivative of both sides of this equation we get\n\\[{\\bf a}=|{\\bf v}|^{\\prime}{\\bf T}+|{\\bf v}|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}.\\] (13.4.1)\nAlso recall the definition of the curvature, \\(\\kappa=|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|/|{\\bf v}|\\), or \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|=\\kappa|{\\bf v}|\\). Finally, recall that we defined the unit normal vector as \\({\\bf N}={\\bf T}^{\\prime}/|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|\\), so \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}=|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}|{\\bf N}=\\kappa|{\\bf v}|{\\bf N}\\). Substituting into equation 13.4.1 we get\n\\[{\\bf a}=|{\\bf v}|^{\\prime}{\\bf T}+\\kappa|{\\bf v}|^{2}{\\bf N}.\\] (13.4.2)\nThe quantity \\(|{\\bf v}(t)|\\) is the speed of the object, often written as \\(v(t)\\); \\(|{\\bf v}(t)|^{\\prime}\\) is the rate at which the speed is changing, or the scalar acceleration of the object, \\(a(t)\\). Rewriting equation 13.4.2 with these gives us\n\\[{\\bf a}=a{\\bf T}+\\kappa v^{2}{\\bf N}=a_{T}{\\bf T}+a_{N}{\\bf N};\\]\n\\(a_{T}\\) is the **tangential component of acceleration** and \\(a_{N}\\) is the **normal component of acceleration**. We have already seen that \\(a_{T}\\) measures how the speed is changing; if\nyou are riding in a vehicle with large \\(a_{T}\\) you will feel a force pulling you into your seat. The other component, \\(a_{N}\\), measures how sharply your direction is changing _with respect to time_. So it naturally is related to how sharply the path is curved, measured by \\(\\kappa\\), and also to how fast you are going. Because \\(a_{N}\\) includes \\(v^{2}\\), note that the effect of speed is magnified; doubling your speed around a curve quadruples the value of \\(a_{N}\\). You feel the effect of this as a force pushing you toward the outside of the curve, the \"centrifugal force.\"\n\n\n",

What is the numeric of the double integral of the function f(x,y)=x*y^3 exp^{x^2+y^2} over I?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nLet's review some laws of exponents and logarithms; let \\(a\\) be a positive number. Since \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\), it's clear that \\(a^{5}\\cdot a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a=a^{8}=a^{5 +3}\\), and in general that \\(a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\). Since \"the logarithm is the exponent,\" it's no surprise that this translates directly into a fact about the logarithm function. Here are three facts\nfrom the example: \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5})=5\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{3})=3\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8\\). So \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5}a^{3})=\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8=5+3=\\log_{a}(a^{5})+\\log_{a}(a^{3})\\). Now let's make this a bit more general. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two numbers, \\(A=a^{x}\\), and \\(B=a^{y}\\). Then \\(\\log_{a}(AB)=\\log_{a}(a^{x}a^{y})=\\log_{a}(a^{x+y})=x+y=\\log_{a}(A)+\\log_{a}(B)\\).\nNow consider \\((a^{5})^{3}=a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}=a^{5+5+5}=a^{5\\cdot 3}=a^{15}\\). Again it's clear that more generally \\((a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}\\), and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If \\(A=a^{x}\\) then \\(A^{y}=(a^{x})^{y}=a^{xy}\\), so \\(\\log_{a}(A^{y})=xy=y\\log_{a}(A)\\)--the exponent can be \"pulled out in front.\"\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. \\(75=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2t}}\\) \\[5.\\ 25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\] \\[6.\\ \\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\]\n**Solution.**\n1. Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\). On the calculator, we graph \\(f(x)=2000\\) and \\(g(x)=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1x}\\) and find that they intersect at \\(x=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\approx-6.3093\\).\n3. We first note that we can rewrite the equation \\(9\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) as \\(3^{2}\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) to obtain \\(3^{x+2}=7^{2x}\\). Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other. We then divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which we obtain by factoring. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ x\\ln(3)+2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)-x\\ln(3)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&x(2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3))\\quad\\mbox{Factor}.\\\\ x&=&\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\end{array}\\] Graphing \\(f(x)=9\\cdot 3^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=7^{2x}\\) on the calculator, we see that these two graphs intersect at \\(x=\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\approx 0.7866\\).\n4. Our objective in solving \\(75=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2t}}\\) is to first isolate the exponential. To that end, we clear denominators and get \\(75\\left(1+3e^{-2t}\\right)=100\\). From this we get \\(75+225e^{-2t}=100\\), which leads to \\(225e^{-2t}=25\\), and finally, \\(e^{-2t}=\\frac{1}{9}\\). Taking the natural log of both sides\ngives \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\). Since natural \\(\\log\\) is \\(\\log\\) base \\(e\\), \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=-2t\\). We can also use the Power Rule to write \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=-\\ln(9)\\). Putting these two steps together, we simplify \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\) to \\(-2t=-\\ln(9)\\). We arrive at our solution, \\(t=\\frac{\\ln(9)}{2}\\) which simplifies to \\(t=\\ln(3)\\). (Can you explain why?) The calculator confirms the graphs of \\(f(x)=75\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2x}}\\) intersect at \\(x=\\ln(3)\\approx 1.099\\). 5. We start solving \\(25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\) by rewriting \\(25=5^{2}\\) so that we have \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{x}=5^{x}+6\\), or \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\). Even though we have a common base, having two terms on the right hand side of the equation foils our plan of equating exponents or taking logs. If we stare at this long enough, we notice that we have three terms with the exponent on one term exactly twice that of another. To our surprise and delight, we have a 'quadratic in disguise'. Letting \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(u^{2}=\\left(5^{x}\\right)^{2}=5^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\) becomes \\(u^{2}=u+6\\). Solving this as \\(u^{2}-u-6=0\\) gives \\(u=-2\\) or \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(5^{x}=-2\\) or \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since \\(5^{x}=-2\\) has no real solution, (Why not?) we focus on \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since it isn't convenient to express \\(3\\) as a power of \\(5\\), we take natural logs and get \\(\\ln\\left(5^{x}\\right)=\\ln(3)\\) so that \\(x\\ln(5)=\\ln(3)\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\). On the calculator, we see the graphs of \\(f(x)=25^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=5^{x}+6\\) intersect at \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\approx 0.6826\\). 6. At first, it's unclear how to proceed with \\(\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\), besides clearing the denominator to obtain \\(e^{x}-e^{-x}=10\\). Of course, if we rewrite \\(e^{-x}=\\frac{1}{e^{x}}\\), we see we have another denominator lurking in the problem: \\(e^{x}-\\frac{1}{e^{x}}=10\\). Clearing this denominator gives us \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\), and once again, we have an equation with three terms where the exponent on one term is exactly twice that of another - a 'quadratic in disguise.' If we let \\(u=e^{x}\\), then \\(u^{2}=e^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\) can be viewed as \\(u^{2}-1=10u\\). Solving \\(u^{2}-10u-1=0\\), we obtain by the quadratic formula \\(u=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). From this, we have \\(e^{x}=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). Since \\(5-\\sqrt{26}<0\\), we get no real solution to \\(e^{x}=5-\\sqrt{26}\\), but for \\(e^{x}=5+\\sqrt{26}\\), we take natural logs to obtain \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\). If we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}\\) and \\(g(x)=5\\), we see that the graphs intersect at \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\approx 2.312\\)\n\n\n",

To graph \\(y=1-2\\sec(2x)\\), we follow the same procedure as in Example 10.5.1. First, we set the argument of secant, \\(2x\\), equal to the 'quarter marks' \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) and solve for \\(x\\).\nNext, we substitute these \\(x\\) values into \\(f(x)\\). If \\(f(x)\\) exists, we have a point on the graph; otherwise, we have found a vertical asymptote. In addition to these points and asymptotes, we have graphed the associated cosine curve - in this case \\(y=1-2\\cos(2x)\\) - dotted in the picture below. Since one cycle is graphed over the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\), the period is \\(\\pi-0=\\pi\\).\nOne cycle of \\(y=1-2\\sec(2x)\\).\n2. Proceeding as before, we set the argument of cosecant in \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\csc(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\) equal to the quarter marks and solve for \\(x\\).\nSubstituting these \\(x\\)-values into \\(g(x)\\), we generate the graph below and find the period to be \\(1-(-1)=2\\). The associated sine curve, \\(y=\\frac{\\sin(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\), is dotted in as a reference.\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. \\(g(x)=3\\sqrt{x}\\) \\(2.\\)\\(j(x)=\\sqrt{9x}\\) \\(3.\\)\\(m(x)=1-\\sqrt{\\frac{x+3}{2}}\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. First we note that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\([0,\\infty)\\) for the usual reason. Next, we have \\(g(x)=3f(x)\\) so by Theorem 1.5, we obtain the graph of \\(g\\) by multiplying all of the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(3\\). The result is a vertical scaling of the graph of \\(f\\) by a factor of \\(3\\). We find the range of \\(g\\) is also \\([0,\\infty)\\).\n2. To determine the domain of \\(j\\), we solve \\(9x\\geq 0\\) to find \\(x\\geq 0\\). Our domain is once again \\([0,\\infty)\\). We recognize \\(j(x)=f(9x)\\) and by Theorem 1.6, we obtain the graph of \\(j\\) by dividing the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(9\\). From the graph, we see the range of \\(j\\) is also \\([0,\\infty)\\).\n3. Solving \\(\\frac{x+3}{2}\\geq 0\\) gives \\(x\\geq-3\\), so the domain of \\(m\\) is \\([-3,\\infty)\\). To take advantage of what we know of transformations, we rewrite \\(m(x)=-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}}+1\\), or \\(m(x)=-f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+1\\). Focusing on the inputs first, we note that the input to \\(f\\) in the formula for \\(m(x)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\). Multiplying the \\(x\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) corresponds to a horizontal stretching by a factor of \\(2\\), and adding the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) corresponds to a shift to the left by \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). As before, we resolve which to perform first by thinking about how we would find the point on \\(m\\) corresponding to a point on \\(f\\), in this case, \\((4,2)\\). To use \\(f(4)=2\\), we solve \\(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}=4\\). Our first step is to subtract the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) (the horizontal shift) to obtain \\(\\frac{1}{2}x=\\frac{5}{2}\\). Next, we multiply by \\(2\\) (the horizontal stretching) and obtain \\(x=5\\). We define two intermediate functions to handle first the shift, then the stretching. In accordance with Theorem 1.3, \\(m_{1}(x)=f\\left(x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=\\sqrt{x+\\frac{3}{2}}\\) will shift the graph of \\(f\\) to the left \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) units.\nNext, \\(m_{2}(x)=m_{1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}}\\) will, according to Theorem 1.6, horizontally stretch the graph of \\(m_{1}\\) by a factor of \\(2\\).\nWe now examine what's happening to the outputs. From \\(m(x)=-f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+1\\), we see that the output from \\(f\\) is being multiplied by \\(-1\\) (a reflection about the \\(x\\)-axis) and then a \\(1\\) is added (a vertical shift up \\(1\\)). As before, we can determine the correct order by looking at how the point \\((4,2)\\) is moved. We already know that to make use of the equation \\(f(4)=2\\), we need to substitute \\(x=5\\). We get \\(m(5)=-f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(5)+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+1=-f(4)+1=-2+1=-1\\). We see that \\(f(4)\\) (the output from \\(f\\)) is first multiplied by \\(-1\\) then the \\(1\\) is added meaning we first reflect the graph about the \\(x\\)-axis then shift up \\(1\\). Theorem 1.4 tells us \\(m_{3}(x)=-m_{2}(x)\\) will handle the reflection.\nFinally, to handle the vertical shift, Theorem 1.2 gives \\(m(x)=m_{3}(x)+1\\), and we see that the range of \\(m\\) is \\((-\\infty,1]\\).\nSome comments about Example 1.7.3 are in order. First, recalling the properties of radicals from Intermediate Algebra, we know that the functions \\(g\\) and \\(j\\) are the same, since \\(j\\) and \\(g\\) have the same domains and \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{9x}=\\sqrt{9}\\sqrt{x}=3\\sqrt{x}=g(x)\\). (We invite the reader to verify that all of the points we plotted on the graph of \\(g\\) lie on the graph of \\(j\\) and vice-versa.) Hence, for \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\) and a horizontal shrinking by a factor of \\(9\\) result in the same transformation. While this kind of phenomenon is not universal, it happens commonly enough with some of the families of functions studied in College Algebra that it is worthy of note. Secondly, to graph the function \\(m\\), we applied a series of four transformations. While it would have been easier on the authors to simply inform the reader of which steps to take, we have strived to explain why the order in which the transformations were applied made sense. We generalize the procedure in the theorem below.\n\n\n",

The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges.

By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges.

What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it).

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\nWe already know one case, not particularly interesting, in which this theorem is true: If \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, we know that the integral \\(\\oint_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=0\\), because any integral of a conservative vector field around a closed curve is zero. We also know in this case that \\(\\partial P/\\partial y=\\partial Q/\\partial x\\), so the double integral in the theorem is simply the integral of the zero function, namely, \\(0\\). So in the case that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, the theorem says simply that \\(0=0\\).\n**Example 16.4.2**: We illustrate the theorem by computing both sides of\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA,\\]\nwhere \\(D\\) is the triangular region with corners \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\).\nStarting with the double integral:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1-x}y\\,dy\\,dx= \\int_{0}^{1}{(1-x)^{2}\\over 2}\\,dx=\\left.-{(1-x)^{3}\\over 6}\\right|_{0}^{1}={1 \\over 6}.\\]\nThere is no single formula to describe the boundary of \\(D\\), so to compute the left side directly we need to compute three separate integrals corresponding to the three sides of the triangle, and each of these integrals we break into two integrals, the \"\\(dx\\)\" part and the \"\\(dy\\)\" part. The three sides are described by \\(y=0\\), \\(y=1-x\\), and \\(x=0\\). The integrals are then\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{\\partial D}\\!\\!x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0} ^{0}0\\,dy+\\int_{1}^{0}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)y\\,dy+\\int_{0}^{0}0\\,dx+\\int_ {1}^{0}0\\,dy\\cr&={1\\over 5}+0-{1\\over 5}+{1\\over 6}+0+0={1\\over 6}.\\cr}\\]\nAlternately, we could describe the three sides in vector form as \\(\\langle t,0\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1-t,t\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle 0,1-t\\rangle\\). Note that in each case, as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), we follow the corresponding side\nin the correct direction. Now\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}+t\\cdot 0\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt+ \\int_{0}^{1}0+0\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt=\\frac{1}{ 6}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1-x}y\\,dy\\,dx= \\int_{0}^{1}{(1-x)^{2}\\over 2}\\,dx=\\left.-{(1-x)^{3}\\over 6}\\right|_{0}^{1}={1 \\over 6}.\\]\nThere is no single formula to describe the boundary of \\(D\\), so to compute the left side directly we need to compute three separate integrals corresponding to the three sides of the triangle, and each of these integrals we break into two integrals, the \"\\(dx\\)\" part and the \"\\(dy\\)\" part.

In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\). If we can find \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) so that \\(\\partial Q/\\partial x-\\partial P/\\partial y=1\\), then the area is also\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy.\\]\nIt is quite easy to do this: \\(P=0,Q=x\\) works, as do \\(P=-y,Q=0\\) and \\(P=-y/2,Q=x/2\\).\n##### Example 16.4.3\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\nProof of Green's Theorem.: We cannot here prove Green's Theorem in general, but we can do a special case. We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\n\n\n",

Once again, we re-write \\(x^{2}-2x>1\\) as \\(x^{2}-2x-1>0\\) and we identify \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x-1\\). When we go to find the zeros of \\(f\\), we find, to our chagrin, that the quadratic \\(x^{2}-2x-1\\) doesn't factor nicely. Hence, we resort to the quadratic formula to solve \\(x^{2}-2x-1=0\\), and arrive at \\(x=1\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\). As before, these zeros divide the number line into three pieces. To help us decide on test values, we approximate \\(1-\\sqrt{2}\\approx-0.4\\) and \\(1+\\sqrt{2}\\approx 2.4\\). We choose \\(x=-1\\), \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=3\\) as our test values and find \\(f(-1)=2\\), which is \\((+)\\); \\(f(0)=-1\\) which is \\((-)\\); and \\(f(3)=2\\) which is \\((+)\\) again. Our solution to \\(x^{2}-2x-1>0\\) is where we have \\((+)\\), so, in interval notation \\(\\left(-\\infty,1-\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\cup\\left(1+\\sqrt{2},\\infty\\right)\\). To check the inequality \\(x^{2}-2x>1\\) graphically, we set \\(g(x)=x^{2}-2x\\) and \\(h(x)=1\\). We are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(g\\) is above the graph of \\(h\\). As before we present the graphs on the right and the sign chart on the left. 3. To solve \\(x^{2}+1\\leq 2x\\), as before, we solve \\(x^{2}-2x+1\\leq 0\\). Setting \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x+1=0\\), we find the only one zero of \\(f\\), \\(x=1\\). This one \\(x\\) value divides the number line into two intervals, from which we choose \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\) as test values. We find \\(f(0)=1>0\\) and \\(f(2)=1>0\\). Since we are looking for solutions to \\(x^{2}-2x+1\\leq 0\\), we are looking for \\(x\\) values where \\(x^{2}-2x+1<0\\) as well as where \\(x^{2}-2x+1=0\\). Looking at our sign diagram, there are no places where \\(x^{2}-2x+1<0\\) (there are no \\((-)\\)), so our solution is only \\(x=1\\) (where \\(x^{2}-2x+1=0\\)). We write this as \\(\\{1\\}\\). Graphically, we solve \\(x^{2}+1\\leq 2x\\) by graphing \\(g(x)=x^{2}+1\\) and \\(h(x)=2x\\). We are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(g\\) is below the graph of \\(h\\) (for \\(x^{2}+1<2x\\)) and where the two graphs intersect (\\(x^{2}+1=2x\\)). Notice that the line and the parabola touch at \\((1,2)\\), but the parabola is always above the line otherwise.4\n4. To solve our last inequality, \\(2x-x^{2}\\geq|x-1|-1\\), we re-write the absolute value using cases. For \\(x<1\\), \\(|x-1|=-(x-1)=1-x\\), so we get \\(2x-x^{2}\\geq 1-x-1\\), or \\(x^{2}-3x\\leq 0\\). Finding the zeros of \\(f(x)=x^{2}-3x\\), we get \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=3\\). However, we are only concerned with the portion of the number line where \\(x<1\\), so the only zero that we concern ourselves with is \\(x=0\\). This divides the interval \\(x<1\\) into two intervals: \\((-\\infty,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\). We choose \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\) as our test values. We find \\(f(-1)=4\\) and \\(f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\frac{5}{4}\\). Hence, our solution to \\(x^{2}-3x\\leq 0\\) for \\(x<1\\) is \\([0,1)\\). Next, we turn our attention to the case \\(x\\geq 1\\). Here, \\(|x-1|=x-1\\), so our original inequality becomes \\(2x-x^{2}\\geq x-1-1\\), or \\(x^{2}-x-2\\leq 0\\). Setting \\(g(x)=x^{2}-x-2\\), we find the zeros of \\(g\\) to be \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=2\\). Of these, only \\(x=2\\) lies in the region \\(x\\geq 1\\), so we ignore \\(x=-1\\). Our test intervals are now \\([1,2)\\) and \\((2,\\infty)\\). We choose \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3\\) as our test values and find \\(g(1)=-2\\) and \\(g(3)=4\\). Hence, our solution to \\(g(x)=x^{2}-x-2\\leq 0\\), in this region is \\([1,2)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1} \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1} &\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1} \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1 }&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1 }\\end{array}\\] Combining these into one sign diagram, we have that our solution is \\([0,2]\\).

Use the definition of determinant to show \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=c\\det(A)\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. We set \\(P(n)\\) to be the equation we are asked to prove.

Next we assume \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is, we assume \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{k}(a+(j-1)d)=\\frac{k}{2}(2a+(k-1)d)\\] and attempt to use this to show \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Namely, we must show \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{k+1}(a+(j-1)d)=\\frac{k+1}{2}(2a+(k+1-1)d)\\] To see how we can use \\(P(k)\\) in this case to prove \\(P(k+1)\\), we note that the sum in \\(P(k+1)\\) is the sum of the first \\(k+1\\) terms of the sequence \\(a_{k}=a+(k-1)d\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) while the sum in \\(P(k)\\) is the sum of the first \\(k\\) terms.

By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we have that \\(P(n)\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(n\\).\n2. We let \\(P(n)\\) be the formula \\((\\overline{z})^{n}=\\overline{z^{n}}\\). The base case \\(P(1)\\) is \\((\\overline{z})^{1}=\\overline{z^{1}}\\), which reduces to \\(\\overline{z}=\\overline{z}\\) which is true. We now assume \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is, we assume \\((\\overline{z})^{k}=\\overline{z^{k}}\\) and attempt to show that \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Since \\((\\overline{z})^{k+1}=(\\overline{z})^{k}\\)\\(\\overline{z}\\), we can use the induction hypothesis and\nwrite \\(\\left(\\overline{z}\\right)^{k}=\\overline{z^{k}}\\). Hence, \\(\\left(\\overline{z}\\right)^{k+1}=\\left(\\overline{z}\\right)^{k}\\)\\(\\overline{z}=\\overline{z^{k}}\\,\\overline{z}\\). We now use the product rule for conjugates4 to write \\(\\overline{z^{k}}\\,\\overline{z}=\\overline{z^{k}}z=\\overline{z^{k+1}}\\). This establishes \\(\\left(\\overline{z}\\right)^{k+1}=\\overline{z^{k+1}}\\), so that \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Hence, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, \\(\\left(\\overline{z}\\right)^{n}=\\overline{z^{n}}\\) for all \\(n\\geq 1\\). Footnote 4: See Exercise 54 in Section 3.4.\n3. The first wrinkle we encounter in this problem is that we are asked to prove this formula for \\(n>5\\) instead of \\(n\\geq 1\\). Since \\(n\\) is a natural number, this means our base step occurs at \\(n=6\\). We can still use the PMI in this case, but our conclusion will be that the formula is valid for all \\(n\\geq 6\\). We let \\(P(n)\\) be the inequality \\(3^{n}>100n\\), and check that \\(P(6)\\) is true. Comparing \\(3^{6}=729\\) and \\(100(6)=600\\), we see \\(3^{6}>100(6)\\) as required. Next, we assume that \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is we assume \\(3^{k}>100k\\). We need to show that \\(P(k+1)\\) is true, that is, we need to show \\(3^{k+1}>100(k+1)\\). Since \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}\\), the induction hypothesis gives \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}>3(100k)=300k\\). We are done if we can show \\(300k>100(k+1)\\) for \\(k\\geq 6\\). Solving \\(300k>100(k+1)\\) we get \\(k>\\frac{1}{2}\\). Since \\(k\\geq 6\\), we know this is true. Putting all of this together, we have \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}>3(100k)=300k>100(k+1)\\), and hence \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. By induction, \\(3^{n}>100n\\) for all \\(n\\geq 6\\).\n\n\n",

Essentially the same argument works for \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\); unfortunately, it is more difficult to show that most functions are equal to their Maclaurin series.\n**EXAMPLE 11.11.3** Find a polynomial approximation for \\(e^{x}\\) near \\(x=2\\) accurate to \\(\\pm 0.005\\).\nFrom Taylor's theorem:\n\\[e^{x}=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}{e^{2}\\over n!}\\,(x-2)^{n}+{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}(x-2)^{N+1},\\]\nsince \\(f^{(n)}(x)=e^{x}\\) for all \\(n\\). We are interested in \\(x\\) near \\(2\\), and we need to keep \\(|(x-2)^{N+1}|\\) in check, so we may as well specify that \\(|x-2|\\leq 1\\), so \\(x\\in[1,3]\\). Also\n\\[\\left|{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}\\right|\\leq{e^{3}\\over(N+1)!},\\]\nso we need to find an \\(N\\) that makes \\(e^{3}/(N+1)!\\leq 0.005\\).

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees us at least one complex zero, \\(z_{1}\\), and as such, the Factor Theorem guarantees that \\(f(x)\\) factors as \\(f(x)=\\left(x-z_{1}\\right)q_{1}(x)\\) for a polynomial function \\(q_{1}\\), of degree exactly \\(n-1\\). If \\(n-1\\geq 1\\), then the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complex zero of \\(q_{1}\\) as well, say \\(z_{2}\\), so then the Factor Theorem gives us \\(q_{1}(x)=\\left(x-z_{2}\\right)q_{2}(x)\\), and hence \\(f(x)=\\left(x-z_{1}\\right)\\left(x-z_{2}\\right)q_{2}(x)\\). We can continue this process exactly \\(n\\) times, at which point our quotient polynomial \\(q_{n}\\) has degree \\(0\\) so it's a constant. This argument gives us the following factorization theorem.\n**Theorem 3.14. Complex Factorization Theorem:** Suppose \\(f\\) is a polynomial function with complex number coefficients. If the degree of \\(f\\) is \\(n\\) and \\(n\\geq 1\\), then \\(f\\) has exactly \\(n\\) complex zeros, counting multiplicity. If \\(z_{1}\\), \\(z_{2}\\), ..., \\(z_{k}\\) are the distinct zeros of \\(f\\), with multiplicities \\(m_{1}\\), \\(m_{2}\\), ..., \\(m_{k}\\), respectively, then \\(f(x)=a\\left(x-z_{1}\\right)^{m_{1}}\\left(x-z_{2}\\right)^{m_{2}}\\cdots\\left(x-z _{k}\\right)^{m_{k}}\\).\nNote that the value \\(a\\) in Theorem 3.14 is the leading coefficient of \\(f(x)\\) (Can you see why?) and as such, we see that a polynomial is completely determined by its zeros, their multiplicities, and its leading coefficient. We put this theorem to good use in the next example.\n**Example 3.4.2.** Let \\(f(x)=12x^{5}-20x^{4}+19x^{3}-6x^{2}-2x+1\\).\n1. Find all of the complex zeros of \\(f\\) and state their multiplicities.\n2. Factor \\(f(x)\\) using Theorem 3.14\n**Solution.**\n1. Since \\(f\\) is a fifth degree polynomial, we know that we need to perform at least three successful divisions to get the quotient down to a quadratic function. At that point, we can find the remaining zeros using the Quadratic Formula, if necessary. Using the techniques developed in Section 3.3, we get\n\\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrrrrr}\\frac{1}{2}&12&-20&19&-6&-2&1\\\\ &\\downarrow&6&-7&6&0&-1\\\\ \\hline 12&-14&12&0&-2&0\\\\ \\downarrow&6&-4&4&2\\\\ \\hline 12&-8&8&4&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4&4&-4\\\\ \\hline 12&-12&12&0\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nOur quotient is \\(12x^{2}-12x+12\\), whose zeros we find to be \\(\\frac{1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). From Theorem 3.14, we know \\(f\\) has exactly \\(5\\) zeros, counting multiplicities, and as such we have the zero \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) with multiplicity \\(2\\), and the zeros \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), each of multiplicity \\(1\\).\n2. Applying Theorem 3.14, we are guaranteed that \\(f\\) factors as \\[f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left[ \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\left(x-\\left[\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\]\nA true test of Theorem 3.14 (and a student's mettle!) would be to take the factored form of \\(f(x)\\) in the previous example and multiply it out9 to see that it really does reduce to the original formula \\(f(x)=12x^{5}-20x^{4}+19x^{3}-6x^{2}-2x+1\\). When factoring a polynomial using Theorem 3.14, we say that it is **factored completely over the complex numbers**, meaning that it is impossible to factor the polynomial any further using complex numbers. If we wanted to completely factor \\(f(x)\\) over the **real numbers** then we would have stopped short of finding the nonreal zeros of \\(f\\) and factored \\(f\\) using our work from the synthetic division to write \\(f(x)=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(12x^{2}-12 x+12\\right)\\), or \\(f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)\\). Since the zeros of \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) are nonreal, we call \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) an **irreducible quadratic** meaning it is impossible to break it down any further using _real_ numbers. Footnote 9: You really should do this once in your life to convince yourself that all of the theory actually does work!\nThe last two results of the section show us that, at least in theory, if we have a polynomial function with real coefficients, we can always factor it down enough so that any nonreal zeros come from irreducible quadratics.\n**Theorem 3.15**.: **Conjugate Pairs Theorem:** If \\(f\\) is a polynomial function with real number coefficients and \\(z\\) is a zero of \\(f\\), then so is \\(\\overline{z}\\).\n\n\n",

A vector tangent to this path is given by the derivative \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(r)=\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\), and a small tangent vector, with length approximately equal to the side of the region, is \\(\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr\\). Likewise, if we fix \\(r=r_{0}=0.5\\), we get the vector function \\({\\bf w}(\\theta)=\\langle r_{0}\\cos\\theta,r_{0}\\sin\\theta,0\\rangle\\) with derivative \\({\\bf w}^{\\prime}(\\theta)=\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta,r_{0}\\cos\\theta,0\\rangle\\) and a small tangent vector \\(\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\) when \\(\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) (at the corner we're focusing on). These vectors are shown in figure 15.7.4, with the actual region outlined by a dotted boundary. Of course, since both \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly good approximation to the true area.\nThe area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta \\times\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr&=\\left|\\matrix{\\bf i &\\bf j&\\bf k\\cr-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0}&r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0}&0\\cr\\cos\\theta_{0}& \\sin\\theta_{0}&0\\cr}\\right|\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{0}-r_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr.}\\]\nThe length of this vector is \\(r_{0}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). So in general, for any values of \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), the area in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane corresponding to a small rectangle anchored at \\((\\theta,r)\\) in the \\(r\\)-\\(\\theta\\) plane is approximately \\(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). In other words, \"\\(r\\)\" replaces the \"?\" in equation 15.7.2.\nIn general, a substitution will start with equations \\(x=f(u,v)\\) and \\(y=g(u,v)\\). Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\). The quantity \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\) is usually denoted\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|=|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\]\nand called the **Jacobian**. Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant\n\\[\\left|\\matrix{f_{u}&g_{u}\\cr f_{v}&g_{v}\\cr}\\right|,\\]\nwhich may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the interior of the unit circle. This is still not an easy integral, but it is easily transformed to polar coordinates, and then easily integrated. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 15.7.5**\\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\)\nThere is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals, though it is a bit more difficult to derive. Suppose we use three substitution functions, \\(x=f(u,v,w)\\), \\(y=g(u,v,w)\\), and \\(z=h(u,v,w)\\). The Jacobian determinant is now\n\\[\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u,v,w)}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}f_{u}&g_{u}&h _{u}\\\\ f_{v}&g_{v}&h_{v}\\\\ f_{w}&g_{w}&h_{w}\\end{array}\\right|.\\]\nThen the integral is transformed in a similar fashion:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nLet's review some laws of exponents and logarithms; let \\(a\\) be a positive number. Since \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\), it's clear that \\(a^{5}\\cdot a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a=a^{8}=a^{5 +3}\\), and in general that \\(a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\). Since \"the logarithm is the exponent,\" it's no surprise that this translates directly into a fact about the logarithm function. Here are three facts\nfrom the example: \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5})=5\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{3})=3\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8\\). So \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5}a^{3})=\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8=5+3=\\log_{a}(a^{5})+\\log_{a}(a^{3})\\). Now let's make this a bit more general. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two numbers, \\(A=a^{x}\\), and \\(B=a^{y}\\). Then \\(\\log_{a}(AB)=\\log_{a}(a^{x}a^{y})=\\log_{a}(a^{x+y})=x+y=\\log_{a}(A)+\\log_{a}(B)\\).\nNow consider \\((a^{5})^{3}=a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}=a^{5+5+5}=a^{5\\cdot 3}=a^{15}\\). Again it's clear that more generally \\((a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}\\), and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If \\(A=a^{x}\\) then \\(A^{y}=(a^{x})^{y}=a^{xy}\\), so \\(\\log_{a}(A^{y})=xy=y\\log_{a}(A)\\)--the exponent can be \"pulled out in front.\"\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\n\n",

Graph \\(f\\) and \\(f^{-1}\\) on the same set of axes and check the symmetry about the line \\(y=x\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n3. To graph \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\) using transformations, we start with \\(j(x)=\\log_{2}(x)\\). We track the points \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},-1\\right)\\), \\((1,0)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) on the graph of \\(j\\) along with the vertical asymptote \\(x=0\\) through the transformations using Theorem 1.7. Since \\(f^{-1}(x)=j(x+3)+1\\), we first subtract 3 from each of the \\(x\\) values (including the vertical asymptote) to obtain \\(\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},-1\\right)\\), \\(\\left(-2,0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(-1,1\\right)\\) with a vertical asymptote \\(x=-3\\). Next, we add 1 to the \\(y\\) values on the graph and get \\(\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\), \\(\\left(-2,1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(-1,2\\right)\\). If you are experiencing _deja vu_, there is a good reason for it but we leave it to the reader to determine the source of this uncanny familiarity. We obtain the graph below. The domain of \\(f^{-1}\\) is \\(\\left(-3,\\infty\\right)\\), which matches the range of \\(f\\), and the range of \\(f^{-1}\\) is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\infty\\right)\\), which matches the domain of \\(f\\).\n4.

As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\nWe can in fact turn this into a L'Hopital's Rule problem:\n\\[x\\ln x=\\frac{\\ln x}{1/x}=\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

So we suppose we have divided the interval \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals as usual, each with length \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), and endpoints \\(a=x_{0}\\), \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), ..., \\(x_{n}=b\\).

In the past we have always used left endpoints (namely, \\(x_{i}\\)) to get a representative value of \\(f\\) on \\([x_{i},x_{i+1}]\\); now we are using a different point, but the principle is the same.\nTo summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval \\([a,b]\\), we compute the integral\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, integrals of this form are typically difficult or impossible to compute exactly, because usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work. In practice this means that the integral will usually have to be approximated.\nLet \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\), the upper half circle of radius \\(r\\).

So we suppose we have divided the interval \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals as usual, each with length \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), and endpoints \\(a=x_{0}\\), \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), ..., \\(x_{n}=b\\). The length of a typical line segment, joining \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\) to \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), is \\(\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^{2}+(f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i}))^{2}}\\). By the Mean Value Theorem (6.5.2), there is a number \\(t_{i}\\) in \\((x_{i},x_{i+1})\\) such that \\(f^{\\prime}(t_{i})\\Delta x=f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i})\\), so the length of\nFigure 9.1: The length of a line segment.\nthe line segment can be written as\n\\[\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^{2}+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i}))^{2}\\Delta x^{2}}=\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i }))^{2}}\\,\\Delta x.\\]\nThe arc length is then\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i}))^{2}}\\,\\Delta x= \\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nNote that the sum looks a bit different than others we have encountered, because the approximation contains a \\(t_{i}\\) instead of an \\(x_{i}\\). In the past we have always used left endpoints (namely, \\(x_{i}\\)) to get a representative value of \\(f\\) on \\([x_{i},x_{i+1}]\\); now we are using a different point, but the principle is the same.\nTo summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval \\([a,b]\\), we compute the integral\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, integrals of this form are typically difficult or impossible to compute exactly, because usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work. In practice this means that the integral will usually have to be approximated.\nLet \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\), the upper half circle of radius \\(r\\). The length of this curve is half the circumference, namely \\(\\pi r\\). Let's compute this with the arc length formula. The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is \\(-x/\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) so the integral is\n\\[\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{x^{2}}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx=\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{r ^{2}}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx=r\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx.\\]\nUsing a trigonometric substitution, we find the antiderivative, namely \\(\\arcsin(x/r)\\). Notice that the integral is improper at both endpoints, as the function \\(\\sqrt{1/(r^{2}-x^{2})}\\) is undefined\nFigure 9.2: Approximating arc length with line segments.\n### Chapter 9 Applications of Integration\nwhen \\(x=\\pm r\\).

Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWhile these sound very different, it turns out that the two problems are very closely related. We know that \"speed\" is really the derivative by a different name; let's start by translating the second question into something that may be easier to visualize. Suppose that the function \\(f(t)\\) gives the position of your car on the toll road at time \\(t\\). Your change in position between one toll booth and the next is given by \\(f(t_{1})-f(t_{0})\\), assuming that at time \\(t_{0}\\) you were at the first booth and at time \\(t_{1}\\) you arrived at the second booth. Your average speed for the trip is \\((f(t_{1})-f(t_{0}))/(t_{1}-t_{0})\\). If we think about the graph of \\(f(t)\\), the average speed is the slope of the line that connects the two points \\((t_{0},f(t_{0}))\\) and \\((t_{1},f(t_{1}))\\). Your speed at any particular time \\(t\\) between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) is \\(f^{\\prime}(t)\\), the slope of the curve. Now question (2) becomes a question about slope. In particular, if the slope between endpoints is 70, what can be said of the slopes at points between the endpoints?\nAs a general rule, when faced with a new problem it is often a good idea to examine one or more simplified versions of the problem, in the hope that this will lead to an understanding of the original problem. In this case, the problem in its \"slope\" form is somewhat easier to simplify than the original, but equivalent, problem.\nHere is a special instance of the problem. Suppose that \\(f(t_{0})=f(t_{1})\\). Then the two endpoints have the same height and the slope of the line connecting the endpoints is zero. What can we say about the slope between the endpoints? It shouldn't take much experimentation before you are convinced of the truth of this statement: Somewhere\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\nPerhaps remarkably, this special case is all we need to prove the more general one as well.\n**THEOREM 6.5.2 Mean Value Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\) and is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 4.3 A hard limit\nWe want to compute this limit:\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin\\Delta x}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nEquivalently, to make the notation a bit simpler, we can compute\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}.\\]\nIn the original context we need to keep \\(x\\) and \\(\\Delta x\\) separate, but here it doesn't hurt to rename \\(\\Delta x\\) to something more convenient.\nTo do this we need to be quite clever, and to employ some indirect reasoning. The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\n\n",

Dotting the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) as we have done before to indicate that the points on the graph itself are not in the relation, we get the shaded region below on the left.\n2. For a point to be in \\(S\\), its \\(y\\)-coordinate must be less than or equal to the \\(y\\)-coordinate on the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\).

Solution.\n1. The inequality is a compound inequality. It translates as and . As usual, we solve each inequality and take the set theoretic intersection to determine the region which satisfies both inequalities. To solve , we write\n\\(y^{2}-x-4\\leq 0\\). The curve \\(y^{2}-x-4=0\\) describes a parabola since exactly one of the variables is squared. Rewriting this in standard form, we get \\(y^{2}=x+4\\) and we see that the vertex is \\((-4,0)\\) and the parabola opens to the right. Using the test points \\((-5,0)\\) and \\((0,0)\\), we find that the solution to the inequality includes the region to the right of, or 'inside', the parabola. The points on the parabola itself are also part of the solution, since the vertex \\((-4,0)\\) satisfies the inequality. We now turn our attention to \\(x<y+2\\). Proceeding as before, we write \\(x-y-2<0\\) and focus our attention on \\(x-y-2=0\\), which is the line \\(y=x-2\\). Using the test points \\((0,0)\\) and \\((0,-4)\\), we find points in the region above the line \\(y=x-2\\) satisfy the inequality. The points on the line \\(y=x-2\\) do not satisfy the inequality, since the \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,-2)\\) does not. We see that these two regions do overlap, and to make the graph more precise, we seek the intersection of these two curves. That is, we need to solve the system of nonlinear equations \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&y^{2}&=&x+4\\\\ (E2)&y&=&x-2\\end{array}\\right.\\] Solving \\(E1\\) for \\(x\\), we get \\(x=y^{2}-4\\). Substituting this into \\(E2\\) gives \\(y=y^{2}-4-2\\), or \\(y^{2}-y-6=0\\). We find \\(y=-2\\) and \\(y=3\\) and since \\(x=y^{2}-4\\), we get that the graphs intersect at \\((0,-2)\\) and \\((5,3)\\). Putting all of this together, we get our final answer below. \\[\\xy\ninside the circle \\((x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=2\\). To produce the most accurate graph, we need to find where these circles intersect.

(The graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) is bolded.) Use these graphs to answer the following questions.\n1. Solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\). 2. Solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\). 3. Solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. To solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\), we look for where the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) intersect. These appear to be at the points \\((-1,2)\\) and \\((1,2)\\), so our solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\).\n2. To solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen for the \\(x\\) values less than \\(-1\\) and greater than \\(1\\). Our solution is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n3. To solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\), we look for solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) as well as \\(f(x)>g(x)\\). We solved the former equation and found \\(x=\\pm 1\\). To solve \\(f(x)>g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is above the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\), on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Hence, our solution to \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\).\nWe now turn our attention to solving inequalities involving the absolute value. We have the following theorem from Intermediate Algebra to help us.\n**Theorem 2.4. Inequalities Involving the Absolute Value:** Let \\(c\\) be a real number.\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\).\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c\\leq x\\leq c\\).\n* For \\(c\\leq 0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) has no solution, and for \\(c<0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) has no solution.\n* For \\(c\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|>c\\) is equivalent to \\(x<-c\\) or \\(x>c\\).\n* For \\(c\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|\\geq c\\) is equivalent to \\(x\\leq-c\\) or \\(x\\geq c\\).\n* For \\(c<0\\), \\(|x|>c\\) and \\(|x|\\geq c\\) are true for all real numbers.\nAs with Theorem 2.1 in Section 2.2, we could argue Theorem 2.4 using cases. However, in light of what we have developed in this section, we can understand these statements graphically. For instance, if \\(c>0\\), the graph of \\(y=c\\) is a horizontal line which lies above the \\(x\\)-axis through \\((0,c)\\). To solve \\(|x|<c\\), we are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) is below the graph of \\(y=c\\). We know that the graphs intersect when \\(|x|=c\\), which, from Section 2.2, we know happens when \\(x=c\\) or \\(x=-c\\). Graphing, we get\nWe see that the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) is below \\(y=c\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(-c\\) and \\(c\\), and hence we get \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\). The other properties in Theorem 2.4 can be shown similarly.\n**Example 2.4.3.** Solve the following inequalities analytically; check your answers graphically.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe key to understanding Theorem 1.2 and, indeed, all of the theorems in this section comes from an understanding of the Fundamental Graphing Principle for Functions. If \\((a,b)\\) is on the graph of \\(f\\), then \\(f(a)=b\\). Substituting \\(x=a\\) into the equation \\(y=f(x)+k\\) gives \\(y=f(a)+k=b+k\\). Hence, \\((a,b+k)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=f(x)+k\\), and we have the result. In the language of 'inputs' and 'outputs', Theorem 1.2 can be paraphrased as \"Adding to, or subtracting from, the _output_ of a function causes the graph to shift up or down, respectively.\" So what happens if we add to or subtract from the _input_ of the function?\nKeeping with the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) above, suppose we wanted to graph \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\). In other words, we are looking to see what happens when we add \\(2\\) to the input of the function.1 Let's try to generate a table of values of \\(g\\) based on those we know for \\(f\\). We quickly find that we run into some difficulties.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\((x,f(x))\\) & \\(f(x)\\) & \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline\n0 & \\((0,1)\\) & 1 & \\(f(0+2)=f(2)=3\\) & \\((0,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n2 & \\((2,3)\\) & 3 & \\(f(2+2)=f(4)=3\\) & \\((2,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n4 & \\((4,3)\\) & 3 & \\(f(4+2)=f(6)=?\\) & \\\\ \\hline\n5 & \\((5,5)\\) & 5 & \\(f(5+2)=f(7)=?\\) & \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} When we substitute \\(x=4\\) into the formula \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\), we are asked to find \\(f(4+2)=f(6)\\) which doesn't exist because the domain of \\(f\\) is only \\([0,5]\\). The same thing happens when we attempt to find \\(g(5)\\). What we need here is a new strategy. We know, for instance, \\(f(0)=1\\). To determine the corresponding point on the graph of \\(g\\), we need to figure out what value of \\(x\\) we must substitute into \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\) so that the quantity \\(x+2\\), works out to be 0. Solving \\(x+2=0\\) gives \\(x=-2\\), and \\(g(-2)=f((-2)+2)=f(0)=1\\) so \\((-2,1)\\) is on the graph of \\(g\\). To use the fact \\(f(2)=3\\), we set \\(x+2=2\\) to get \\(x=0\\). Substituting gives \\(g(0)=f(0+2)=f(2)=3\\). Continuing in this fashion, we get\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\(x+2\\) & \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-2\\) & 0 & \\(g(-2)=f(0)=1\\) & \\((-2,1)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 2 & \\(g(0)=f(2)=3\\) & \\((0,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 4 & \\(g(2)=f(4)=3\\) & \\((2,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n3 & 5 & \\(g(3)=f(5)=5\\) & \\((3,5)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} In summary, the points \\((0,1)\\), \\((2,3)\\), \\((4,3)\\) and \\((5,5)\\) on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) give rise to the points \\((-2,1)\\), \\((0,3)\\), \\((2,3)\\) and \\((3,5)\\) on the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\), respectively. In general, if \\((a,b)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\), then \\(f(a)=b\\). Solving \\(x+2=a\\) gives \\(x=a-2\\) so that \\(g(a-2)=f((a-2)+2)=f(a)=b\\). As such, \\((a-2,b)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). The point \\((a-2,b)\\) is exactly 2 units to the _left_ of the point \\((a,b)\\) so the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) is obtained by shifting the graph \\(y=f(x)\\) to the left 2 units, as pictured below.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\(x+2\\) & \\(g(x)=f(x+2)\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-2\\) & 0 & \\(g(-2)=f(0)=1\\) & \\((-2,1)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 2 & \\(g(0)=f(2)=3\\) & \\((0,3)\\) \\\\ \\hline\n\n\n",

What is y(\\pi/4)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 17.6 Second Order Linear Equations\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\\[\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=2a-(2at+b)-6(at^{2}+bt+c)=-6at^{2}+(-2a-6b)t+(2a-b-6c).\\]\nWe want this to equal \\(18t^{2}+5\\), so we need\n\\[\\eqalign{-6a&=18\\cr-2a-6b&=0\\cr 2a-b-6c&=5\\cr}\\]\nThis is a system of three equations in three unknowns and is not hard to solve: \\(a=-3\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=-2\\). Thus the general solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}-3t^{2}+t-2\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSo the \"judicious guess\" is a function with the same form as \\(f(t)\\) but with undetermined (or better, yet to be determined) coefficients. This works whenever \\(f(t)\\) is a polynomial.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.2** Consider the initial value problem \\(m\\ddot{y}+ky=-mg\\), \\(y(0)=2\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=50\\). The left hand side represents a mass-spring system with no damping, i.e., \\(b=0\\). Unlike the homogeneous case, we now consider the force due to gravity, \\(-mg\\), assuming the spring is vertical at the surface of the earth, so that \\(g=980\\). To be specific, let us take \\(m=1\\) and \\(k=100\\). The general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)\\). For the solution to the non-homogeneous equation we guess simply a constant \\(y=a\\), since \\(-mg=-980\\) is a constant. Then \\(\\ddot{y}+100y=100a\\) so \\(a=-980/100=-9.8\\). The desired general solution is then \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). Substituting the initial conditions we get\n\\[\\eqalign{2&=A-9.8\\cr 50&=10B\\cr}\\]\nso \\(A=11.8\\) and \\(B=5\\) and the solution is \\(11.8\\cos(10t)+5\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nMore generally, this method can be used when a function similar to \\(f(t)\\) has derivatives that are also similar to \\(f(t)\\); in the examples so far, since \\(f(t)\\) was a polynomial, so were its derivatives. The method will work if \\(f(t)\\) has the form \\(p(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)+q(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)\\), where \\(p(t)\\) and \\(q(t)\\) are polynomials; when \\(\\alpha=\\beta=0\\) this is simply \\(p(t)\\), a polynomial. In the most general form it is not simple to describe the appropriate judicious guess; we content ourselves with some examples to illustrate the process.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe general first order equation is rather too general, that is, we can't describe methods that will work on them all, or even a large portion of them. We can make progress with specific kinds of first order differential equations. For example, much can be said about equations of the form where is a function of the two variables and . Under reasonable conditions on , such an equation has a solution and the corresponding initial value problem has a unique solution. However, in general, these equations can be very difficult or impossible to solve explicitly.\nExample 17.1.6 Consider this specific example of an initial value problem for Newton's law of cooling: , . We first note that if , the right hand side of the differential equation is zero, and so the constant function is a solution to the differential equation. It is not a solution to the initial value problem, since . (The physical interpretation of this constant solution is that if a liquid is at the same temperature as its surroundings, then the liquid will stay at that temperature.)\n### First Order Differential Equations\nSo long as \\(y\\) is not 25, we can rewrite the differential equation as\n\\[\\eqalign{{dy\\over dt}{1\\over 25-y}&=2\\cr{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=2\\,dt,}\\]\nso\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy=\\int 2\\,dt,\\]\nthat is, the two anti-derivatives must be the same except for a constant difference. We can calculate these anti-derivatives and rearrange the results:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\nAs before, all solutions are represented by \\(y=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}\\), allowing \\(A\\) to be zero. \\(\\Box\\)\n**DEFINITION 17.1.8**: A first order differential equation is **separable** if it can be written in the form \\(\\dot{y}=f(t)g(y)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nAs in the examples, we can attempt to solve a separable equation by converting to the form\n\\[\\int{1\\over g(y)}\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nThis technique is called **separation of variables**. The simplest (in principle) sort of separable equation is one in which \\(g(y)=1\\), in which case we attempt to solve\n\\[\\int 1\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nWe can do this if we can find an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)\\).\n\n\n",

We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt} +R{dz\\over dt}\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+R\\left({\\partial z \\over\\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt.\\]\nusing the chain rule for \\(dz/dt\\). Now we continue to manipulate this:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+&R\\left({\\partial z\\over \\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt\\cr &=\\int_{a}^{b}\\left[\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right){dx\\over dt}+ \\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right){dy\\over dt}\\right]\\,dt\\cr&=\\int_{ \\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{\\partial z \\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy,}\\]\nwhich now looks just like the line integral of Green's Theorem, except that the functions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) of Green's Theorem have been replaced by the more complicated \\(P+R(\\partial z/\\partial x)\\) and \\(Q+R(\\partial z/\\partial y)\\). We can apply Green's Theorem to get\n\\[\\int_{\\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{ \\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}{\\partial \\over\\partial x}\\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)-{\\partial\\over \\partial y}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dA.\\]\nNow we can use the chain rule again to evaluate the derivatives inside this integral, and it becomes\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}&Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}+R_{z}g_{x}g_{ y}+Rg_{yx}-\\left(P_{y}+P_{z}g_{y}+R_{y}g_{x}+R_{z}g_{y}g_{x}+Rg_{xy}\\right)\\,dA\\cr&= \\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}-P_{y}-P_{z}g_{y}-R_{y}g_ {x}\\,dA,}\\]\nwhich is the same as the expression we obtained for the surface integral.\n### 16 Vector Calculus\n#### Exercises 16.8\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}P{\\bf i}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}P_{x}\\,dV,\\] \\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}Q{\\bf j}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{y}\\,dV,\\;\\mbox{and}\\] (16.9.1) \\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}R{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}R_{z}\\,dV.\\]\nNot surprisingly, these are all pretty much the same; we'll do the first one.\nWe set the triple integral up with \\(dx\\) innermost:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}P_{x}\\,dV=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{B}\\int_{g_{1}(y ,z)}^{g_{2}(y,z)}\\,P_{x}\\,dx\\,dA=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{B}P(g_{2}(y,z),y,z)- P(g_{1}(y,z),y,z)\\,dA,\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is the region in the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane over which we integrate. The boundary surface of \\(E\\) consists of a \"top\" \\(x=g_{2}(y,z)\\), a \"bottom\" \\(x=g_{1}(y,z)\\), and a \"wrap-around side\" that is vertical to the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane. To integrate over the entire boundary surface, we can integrate over each of these (top, bottom, side) and add the results. Over the side surface, the vector \\({\\bf N}\\) is perpendicular to the vector \\({\\bf i}\\), so\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{\\rm side}P{\\bf i}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int \\limits_{\\rm side}0\\,dS=0.\\]\nThus, we are left with just the surface integral over the top plus the surface integral over the bottom. For the top, we use the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle g_{2}(y,z),y,z\\rangle\\) which gives\n### Chapter 16 Vector Calculus\n\\({\\bf r}_{y}\\times{\\bf r}_{z}=\\langle 1,-g_{2y},-g_{2z}\\rangle\\); the dot product of this with \\({\\bf i}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle\\) is 1.

Now\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int_{D}P{\\bf i}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int_{B}P(g_{2}(y ,z),y,z)\\,dA-\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int_{B}P(g_{1}(y,z),y,z)\\,dA,\\]\nwhich is the same as the value of the triple integral above.\n**Example 16.9.2** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle 2x,3y,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and consider the three-dimensional volume inside the cube with faces parallel to the principal planes and opposite corners at \\((0,0,0)\\) and \\((1,1,1)\\). We compute the two integrals of the divergence theorem.\nThe triple integral is the easier of the two:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}2+3+2z\\,dx\\,dy\\,dz=6.\\]\nThe surface integral must be separated into six parts, one for each face of the cube. One face is \\(z=0\\) or \\({\\bf r}=\\langle u,v,0\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq u,v\\leq 1\\). Then \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,0,1\\rangle\\). We need this to be oriented downward (out of the cube), so we use \\(\\langle 0,0,-1\\rangle\\) and the corresponding integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}-z^{2}\\,du\\,dv=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}0\\,du\\,dv=0.\\]\nAnother face is \\(y=1\\) or \\({\\bf r}=\\langle u,1,v\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle 1,0,0\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,0,1\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-1,0\\rangle\\). We need a normal in the positive \\(y\\) direction, so we convert this to \\(\\langle 0,1,0\\rangle\\), and the corresponding integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}3y\\,du\\,dv=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1}3\\,du\\,dv=3.\\]\nThe remaining four integrals have values 0, 0, 2, and 1, and the sum of these is 6, in agreement with the triple integral.\n**Example 16.9.3** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle x^{3},y^{3},z^{2}\\rangle\\), and consider the cylindrical volume \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 9\\), \\(0\\leq z\\leq 2\\).

The top of the cylinder can be represented by \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2\\rangle\\); \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,0,-v\\rangle\\), which points down into the cylinder, so we convert it to \\(\\langle 0,0,v\\rangle\\).

How long until 4200 people have heard the rumor?\n4. Check your answers to 2 and 3 using your calculator.\n**Solution.**\n1. We find \\(N(0)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{0}}=\\frac{84}{2800}=\\frac{3}{100}\\). Since \\(N(t)\\) measures the number of people who have heard the rumor in hundreds, \\(N(0)\\) corresponds to 3 people. Since \\(t=0\\) corresponds to April 1, 2009, we may conclude that on that day, 3 people have heard the rumor.14 Footnote 14: Or, more likely, three people started the rumor. I’d wager Jeff, Jamie, and Jason started it. So much for telling your best friends something in confidence!\n2. We could simply note that \\(N(t)\\) is written in the form of Equation 6.7, and identify \\(L=84\\). However, to see why the answer is 84, we proceed analytically. Since the domain of \\(N\\) is restricted to \\(t\\geq 0\\), the only end behavior of significance is \\(t\\to\\infty\\). As we've seen before,15 as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), we have \\(1997e^{-t}\\to 0^{+}\\) and so \\(N(t)\\approx\\frac{84}{1+\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx 84\\). Hence, as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(N(t)\\to 84\\). This means that as time goes by, the number of people who will have heard the rumor approaches 8400. Footnote 15: See, for example, Example 6.1.2.\n3. To find how long it takes until 4200 people have heard the rumor, we set \\(N(t)=42\\). Solving \\(\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-t}}=42\\) gives \\(t=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\). It takes around 8 days until 4200 people have heard the rumor.\n4. We graph \\(y=N(x)\\) using the calculator and see that the line \\(y=84\\) is the horizontal asymptote of the graph, confirming our answer to part 2, and the graph intersects the line \\(y=42\\) at \\(x=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\), which confirms our answer to part 3.\nIf we take the time to analyze the graph of \\(y=N(x)\\) above, we can see graphically how logistic growth combines features of uninhibited and limited growth. The curve seems to rise steeply, then at some point, begins to level off. The point at which this happens is called an **inflection point** or is sometimes called the 'point of diminishing returns'. At this point, even though the function is still increasing, the rate at which it does so begins to decline. It turns out the point of diminishing returns always occurs at half the limiting population. (In our case, when \\(y=42\\).) While these concepts are more precisely quantified using Calculus, below are two views of the graph of \\(y=N(x)\\), one on the interval \\([0,8]\\), the other on \\([8,15]\\). The former looks strikingly like uninhibited growth; the latter like limited growth.\n\\(y=f(x)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-x}}\\) for \\(0\\leq x\\leq 8\\)\\(y=f(x)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-x}}\\) for \\(8\\leq x\\leq 16\\)\n#### Applications of Logarithms\nJust as many physical phenomena can be modeled by exponential functions, the same is true of logarithmic functions. In Exercises 75, 76 and 77 of Section 6.1, we showed that logarithms are useful in measuring the intensities of earthquakes (the Richter scale), sound (decibels) and acids and bases (pH). We now present yet a different use of the a basic logarithm function, password strength.\n**Example 6.5.6**.: The information entropy \\(H\\), in bits, of a randomly generated password consisting of \\(L\\) characters is given by \\(H=L\\log_{2}(N)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of possible symbols for each character in the password. In general, the higher the entropy, the stronger the password.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-1&3\\\\ 5&2\\end{array}\\right]\\), \\(B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}7&0&8\\\\ -3&1&4\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n* \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}7&0&8\\\\ -3&1&4\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n* \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}7&0\\\\ 8\\\\ 9\\end{array}\\right]\\), \\(B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1&2&3\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n* \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}2&-3&5\\\\ 17&33&19\\\\ 10&19&11\\end{array}\\right]\\)\nIn Exercises 8 - 21, use the matrices\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1&2\\\\ 3&4\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\ B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}0&-3\\\\ -5&2\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\ C=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}10&-\\frac{11}{2}&0\\\\ \\frac{3}{5}&5&9\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\\[D=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}7&-13\\\\ -\\frac{4}{3}&0\\\\ 6&8\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\ E=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1&2&3\\\\ 0&4&-9\\\\ 0&0&-5\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nto compute the following or state that the indicated operation is undefined.\nIn Exercises 23 - 29, consider the following scenario. In the small village of Pedimaxus in the country of Sasquatchia, all 150 residents get one of the two local newspapers. Market research has shown that in any given week, 90% of those who subscribe to the Pedimaxus Tribune want to keep getting it, but 10% want to switch to the Sasquatchia Picayune. Of those who receive the Picayune, 80% want to continue with it and 20% want switch to the Tribune. We can express this situation using matrices. Specifically, let \\(X\\) be the 'state matrix' given by\n\\[X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}T\\\\ P\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of people who get the Tribune and \\(P\\) is the number of people who get the Picayune in a given week. Let \\(Q\\) be the 'transition matrix' given by\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.90&0.20\\\\ 0.10&0.80\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nsuch that \\(QX\\) will be the state matrix for the next week.\n1. Let's assume that when Pedimaxus was founded, all 150 residents got the Tribune. (Let's call this Week 0.) This would mean \\[X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}150\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\] Since 10% of that 150 want to switch to the Picayune, we should have that for Week 1, 135 people get the Tribune and 15 people get the Picayune. Show that \\(QX\\) in this situation is indeed \\[QX=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}135\\\\ 15\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n2. Assuming that the percentages stay the same, we can get to the subscription numbers for Week 2 by computing \\(Q^{2}X\\). How many people get each paper in Week 2?\n3. Explain why the transition matrix does what we want it to do.\n4. If the conditions do not change from week to week, then \\(Q\\) remains the same and we have what's known as a **Stochastic Process10** because Week \\(n\\)'s numbers are found by computing \\(Q^{n}X\\). Choose a few values of \\(n\\) and, with the help of your classmates and calculator, find out how many people get each paper for that week. You should start to see a pattern as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\). Footnote 10: More specifically, we have a Markov Chain, which is a special type of stochastic process.\n5. If you didn't see the pattern, we'll help you out. Let \\[X_{s}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}100\\\\ 50\\end{array}\\right].\\] Show that \\(QX_{s}=X_{s}\\) This is called the **steady state** because the number of people who get each paper didn't change for the next week. Show that \\(Q^{n}X\\to X_{s}\\) as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\).\n28. Now let \\[S=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\frac{2}{3}&\\frac{2}{3}\\\\ \\frac{1}{3}&\\frac{1}{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\] Show that \\(Q^{n}\\to S\\) as \\(n\\to\\infty\\).\n29. Show that \\(SY=X_{s}\\) for any matrix \\(Y\\) of the form \\[Y=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}y\\\\ 150-y\\end{array}\\right]\\] This means that no matter how the distribution starts in Pedimaxus, if \\(Q\\) is applied often enough, we always end up with 100 people getting the Tribune and 50 people getting the Picayune.\n30. Let \\(z=a+bi\\) and \\(w=c+di\\) be arbitrary complex numbers. Associate \\(z\\) and \\(w\\) with the matrices \\[Z=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\ -b&a\\end{array}\\right]\\;\\;\\mbox{and}\\;\\;W=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}c&d\\\\ -d&c\\end{array}\\right]\\] Show that complex number addition, subtraction and multiplication are mirrored by the associated _matrix_ arithmetic. That is, show that \\(Z+W\\), \\(Z-W\\) and \\(ZW\\) produce matrices which can be associated with the complex numbers \\(z+w\\), \\(z-w\\) and \\(zw\\), respectively.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nUse the Trapezoidal Rule with to approximate $\\int_0^{\\pi} sin^2(x)dx$. Return the approximated demical value.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe trapezoid approximation works well, especially compared to rectangles, because the tops of the trapezoids form a reasonably good approximation to the curve when \\(\\Delta x\\) is fairly small. We can extend this idea: what if we try to approximate the curve more closely,\nby using something other than a straight line? The obvious candidate is a parabola: if we can approximate a short piece of the curve with a parabola with equation \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), we can easily compute the area under the parabola.\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nRecall that the tangent line to \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x=a\\) is given by \\(L(x)=f^{\\prime}(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\). The tangent line in this context is also called the **linear approximation** to \\(f\\) at \\(a\\).\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\nFigure 6.4.1: The linear approximation to \\(y=x^{2}\\).\nfunctions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.\n##### Example 6.4.2\nConsider the trigonometric function \\(\\sin x\\). Its linear approximation at \\(x=0\\) is simply \\(L(x)=x\\). When \\(x\\) is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.\n##### Definition 6.4.3\nLet \\(y=f(x)\\) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable \\(dx\\), and a new dependent variable \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\). Notice that \\(dy\\) is a function both of \\(x\\) (since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is a function of \\(x\\)) and of \\(dx\\). We say that \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are **differentials**.\n_Remark._ Up until now, \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) made sense only together, as \\(dy/dx\\), another way to write \\(f^{\\prime}\\). Now we have given them have individual meanings, but notice that since \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\), \\(dy/dx=f^{\\prime}(x)\\), so the new meanings are consistent with the former usage.\nLet \\(\\Delta x=x-a\\) and \\(\\Delta y=f(x)-f(a)\\). If \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\) then \\(\\Delta x\\) is small. If we set \\(dx=\\Delta x\\) then\n\\[dy=f^{\\prime}(a)\\,dx\\approx\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\Delta x=\\Delta y.\\]\nThus, \\(dy\\) can be used to approximate \\(\\Delta y\\), the actual change in the function \\(f\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). This is exactly the approximation given by the tangent line:\n\\[dy=f^{\\prime}(a)(x-a)=f^{\\prime}(a)(x-a)+f(a)-f(a)=L(x)-f(a).\\]\nWhile \\(L(x)\\) approximates \\(f(x)\\), \\(dy\\) approximates how \\(f(x)\\) has changed from \\(f(a)\\). Figure 6.4.2 illustrates the relationships.\n\n\n",

If we do not limit the value of \\(x\\), we still have\n\\[\\left|\\frac{f^{(N+1)}(z)}{(N+1)!}x^{N+1}\\right|\\leq\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|\\]\nso that \\(\\sin x\\) is represented by\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\,x^{n}\\pm\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!} \\right|.\\]\nIf we can show that\n\\[\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{x^{N+1}}{(N+1)!}\\right|=0\\]\nfor each \\(x\\) then\n\\[\\sin x=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\,x^{n}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1) ^{n}\\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!},\\]\nthat is, the sine function is actually equal to its Maclaurin series for all \\(x\\). How can we prove that the limit is zero? Suppose that \\(N\\) is larger than \\(|x|\\), and let \\(M\\) be the largest integer less than \\(|x|\\) (if \\(M=0\\) the following is even easier). Then\n\\[\\frac{|x^{N+1}|}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\frac{|x|}{N}\\frac{|x|}{N-1}\\cdots\\frac{|x|}{M+1} \\frac{|x|}{M}\\frac{|x|}{M-1}\\cdots\\frac{|x|}{2}\\frac{|x|}{1}\\] \\[\\leq \\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\cdot 1\\cdot 1\\cdots 1\\cdot\\frac{|x|}{M}\\frac{|x|}{M- 1}\\cdots\\frac{|x|}{2}\\frac{|x|}{1}\\] \\[= \\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\frac{|x|^{M}}{M!}.\\]\nThe quantity \\(|x|^{M}/M!\\) is a constant, so\n\\[\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\frac{|x|^{M}}{M!}=0\\]\nFigure 11.11.1 \\(\\sin x\\) and a polynomial approximation. (AP)\nand by the Squeeze Theorem (11.1.3)\n\\[\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\left|{x^{N+1}\\over(N+1)!}\\right|=0\\]\nas desired. Essentially the same argument works for \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\); unfortunately, it is more difficult to show that most functions are equal to their Maclaurin series.\n**EXAMPLE 11.11.3** Find a polynomial approximation for \\(e^{x}\\) near \\(x=2\\) accurate to \\(\\pm 0.005\\).\nFrom Taylor's theorem:\n\\[e^{x}=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}{e^{2}\\over n!}\\,(x-2)^{n}+{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}(x-2)^{N+1},\\]\nsince \\(f^{(n)}(x)=e^{x}\\) for all \\(n\\). We are interested in \\(x\\) near \\(2\\), and we need to keep \\(|(x-2)^{N+1}|\\) in check, so we may as well specify that \\(|x-2|\\leq 1\\), so \\(x\\in[1,3]\\). Also\n\\[\\left|{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}\\right|\\leq{e^{3}\\over(N+1)!},\\]\nso we need to find an \\(N\\) that makes \\(e^{3}/(N+1)!\\leq 0.005\\). This time \\(N=5\\) makes \\(e^{3}/(N+1)!<0.0015\\), so the approximating polynomial is\n\\[e^{x}=e^{2}+e^{2}(x-2)+{e^{2}\\over 2}(x-2)^{2}+{e^{2}\\over 6}(x-2)^{3}+{e^{2} \\over 24}(x-2)^{4}+{e^{2}\\over 120}(x-2)^{5}\\pm 0.0015.\\]\nThis presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also need to approximate \\(e^{2}\\), and any approximation we use will increase the error, but we will not pursue this complication. \\(\\sqcap\\)\nNote well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on a small interval, even though the series for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\) converge for all \\(x\\); this is typical. To get the same accuracy on a larger interval would require more terms.\nExercises 11.11.\n1.

Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\). On the calculator, we graph \\(f(x)=2000\\) and \\(g(x)=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1x}\\) and find that they intersect at \\(x=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\approx-6.3093\\).\n3. We first note that we can rewrite the equation \\(9\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) as \\(3^{2}\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) to obtain \\(3^{x+2}=7^{2x}\\). Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other. We then divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which we obtain by factoring. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ x\\ln(3)+2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)-x\\ln(3)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&x(2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3))\\quad\\mbox{Factor}.\\\\ x&=&\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\end{array}\\] Graphing \\(f(x)=9\\cdot 3^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=7^{2x}\\) on the calculator, we see that these two graphs intersect at \\(x=\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\approx 0.7866\\).\n4. Our objective in solving \\(75=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2t}}\\) is to first isolate the exponential. To that end, we clear denominators and get \\(75\\left(1+3e^{-2t}\\right)=100\\). From this we get \\(75+225e^{-2t}=100\\), which leads to \\(225e^{-2t}=25\\), and finally, \\(e^{-2t}=\\frac{1}{9}\\). Taking the natural log of both sides\ngives \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\). Since natural \\(\\log\\) is \\(\\log\\) base \\(e\\), \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=-2t\\). We can also use the Power Rule to write \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=-\\ln(9)\\). Putting these two steps together, we simplify \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\) to \\(-2t=-\\ln(9)\\). We arrive at our solution, \\(t=\\frac{\\ln(9)}{2}\\) which simplifies to \\(t=\\ln(3)\\). (Can you explain why?) The calculator confirms the graphs of \\(f(x)=75\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2x}}\\) intersect at \\(x=\\ln(3)\\approx 1.099\\). 5. We start solving \\(25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\) by rewriting \\(25=5^{2}\\) so that we have \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{x}=5^{x}+6\\), or \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\). Even though we have a common base, having two terms on the right hand side of the equation foils our plan of equating exponents or taking logs. If we stare at this long enough, we notice that we have three terms with the exponent on one term exactly twice that of another. To our surprise and delight, we have a 'quadratic in disguise'. Letting \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(u^{2}=\\left(5^{x}\\right)^{2}=5^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\) becomes \\(u^{2}=u+6\\). Solving this as \\(u^{2}-u-6=0\\) gives \\(u=-2\\) or \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(5^{x}=-2\\) or \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since \\(5^{x}=-2\\) has no real solution, (Why not?) we focus on \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since it isn't convenient to express \\(3\\) as a power of \\(5\\), we take natural logs and get \\(\\ln\\left(5^{x}\\right)=\\ln(3)\\) so that \\(x\\ln(5)=\\ln(3)\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\). On the calculator, we see the graphs of \\(f(x)=25^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=5^{x}+6\\) intersect at \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\approx 0.6826\\). 6. At first, it's unclear how to proceed with \\(\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\), besides clearing the denominator to obtain \\(e^{x}-e^{-x}=10\\). Of course, if we rewrite \\(e^{-x}=\\frac{1}{e^{x}}\\), we see we have another denominator lurking in the problem: \\(e^{x}-\\frac{1}{e^{x}}=10\\). Clearing this denominator gives us \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\), and once again, we have an equation with three terms where the exponent on one term is exactly twice that of another - a 'quadratic in disguise.' If we let \\(u=e^{x}\\), then \\(u^{2}=e^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\) can be viewed as \\(u^{2}-1=10u\\). Solving \\(u^{2}-10u-1=0\\), we obtain by the quadratic formula \\(u=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). From this, we have \\(e^{x}=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). Since \\(5-\\sqrt{26}<0\\), we get no real solution to \\(e^{x}=5-\\sqrt{26}\\), but for \\(e^{x}=5+\\sqrt{26}\\), we take natural logs to obtain \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\). If we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}\\) and \\(g(x)=5\\), we see that the graphs intersect at \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\approx 2.312\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe close this section by finding the inverse of a function which is a composition of a rational function with an exponential function.\n**Example 6.3.4**.: The function \\(f(x)=\\frac{5e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}\\) is one-to-one. Find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and check your answer graphically using your calculator.\n**Solution.** We start by writing \\(y=f(x)\\), and interchange the roles of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

To verify this analytically, we would need to verify the compositions \\(\\left(f^{-1}\\circ f\\right)(x)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\) and that \\(\\left(f\\circ f^{-1}\\right)(x)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f^{-1}\\). We leave this to the reader. To verify our solution graphically, we graph \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{5e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{5-x}\\right)\\) on the same set of axes and observe the symmetry about the line \\(y=x\\).

No real difference is required in the definition of limit, except that we specify, perhaps implicitly, that the variable is an integer. Compare this definition to definition 4.10.4.\n**DEFINITION 11.1.1** Suppose that \\({\\{a_{n}\\}}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a sequence. We say that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(n>N\\), \\(|a_{n}-L|<\\epsilon\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=L\\) we say that the sequence **converges**, otherwise it **diverges**. \\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=L\\), then \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_{n}=L\\).\nAnd a final useful fact:\n**Theorem 11.1.4**.: \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|=0\\) if and only if \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\).\nThis says simply that the size of \\(a_{n}\\) gets close to zero if and only if \\(a_{n}\\) gets close to zero.\n**Example 11.1.5**.: Determine whether \\(\\left\\{\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. Since this makes sense for real numbers we consider\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{x}{x+1}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1-\\frac{1}{x+1}=1-0=1.\\]\nThus the sequence converges to \\(1\\).\n**Example 11.1.6**.: Determine whether \\(\\left\\{\\frac{\\ln n}{n}\\right\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. We compute\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln x}{x}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1/x}{1}=0,\\]\nusing L'Hopital's Rule. Thus the sequence converges to \\(0\\).\n**Example 11.1.7**.: Determine whether \\(\\{(-1)^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. This does not make sense for all real exponents, but the sequence is easy to understand: it is\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nA sequence is **bounded above** if there is some number \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\), and **bounded below** if there is some number \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{n}\\geq N\\) for every \\(n\\). If a sequence is bounded above and bounded below it is **bounded**. If a sequence \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by \\(a_{0}\\)), and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is bounded above (by \\(a_{0}\\)). Finally, with all this new terminology we can state an important theorem.\n**Theorem 11.1.12** If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n**Example 11.1.13** All of the terms \\((2^{i}-1)/2^{i}\\) are less than 2, and the sequence is increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\nAgain we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know. So we look at \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\):\n\\[{a_{n+1}\\over a_{n}}={(n+1)!\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}{n^{n}\\over n!}={(n+1)!\\over n!} {n^{n}\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}={n+1\\over n+1}\\left({n\\over n+1}\\right)^{n}=\\left({n \\over n+1}\\right)^{n}<1.\\]\n\n\n",

As in Example 11.8.3, we work out the problem in great detail and encourage the reader to supply the justification for each step.\n**Example 11.9.1**.: Prove the identity: .\n**Solution.** We begin by rewriting in terms of the dot product using Theorem 11.22.\nHence, as required.\nIf we take a step back from the pedantry in Example 11.9.1, we see that the bulk of the work is needed to show that . If this looks familiar, it should. Since the dot product enjoys many of the same properties enjoyed by real numbers, the machinations required to expand for vectors for and match those required to expand for real numbers and , and hence we get similar looking results. The identity verified in Example 11.9.1 plays a large role in the development of the geometric properties of the dot product, which we now explore.\nSuppose and are two nonzero vectors. If we draw and with the same initial point, we define the **angle between** and to be the angle determined by the rays containing the vectors and , as illustrated below. We require . (Think about why this is needed in the definition.)\nThe following theorem gives us some insight into the geometric role the dot product plays.\n**Theorem 11.23**.: **Geometric Interpretation of Dot Product:** If and are nonzero vectors then , where is the angle between and .\nWe prove Theorem 11.23 in cases. If \\(\\theta=0\\), then \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) have the same direction. It follows1 that there is a real number \\(k>0\\) so that \\(\\vec{w}=k\\vec{v}\\). Hence, \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\vec{v}\\cdot(k\\vec{v})=k(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{v})=k\\|\\vec{v}\\| ^{2}=k\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\). Since \\(k>0\\), \\(k=|k|\\), so \\(k\\|\\vec{v}\\|=k\\|\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\|k\\vec{v}\\|\\) by Theorem 11.20. Hence, \\(k\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|(k\\|\\vec{v}\\|)=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|k\\vec{v}\\|=\\| \\vec{v}\\|\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\cos(0)=1\\), we get \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=k\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\| \\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(0)\\), proving that the formula holds for \\(\\theta=0\\). If \\(\\theta=\\pi\\), we repeat the argument with the difference being \\(\\vec{w}=k\\vec{v}\\) where \\(k<0\\). In this case, \\(|k|=-k\\), so \\(k\\|\\vec{v}\\|=-|k|\\|\\vec{v}\\|=-\\|k\\vec{v}\\|=-\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\cos(\\pi)=-1\\), we get \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=-\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\pi)\\), as required. Next, if \\(0<\\theta<\\pi\\), the vectors \\(\\vec{v}\\), \\(\\vec{w}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\) determine a triangle with side lengths \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\), \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|\\), respectively, as seen below.\nFootnote 1: Since \\(\\vec{v}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\hat{w}\\), if \\(\\hat{v}=\\hat{w}\\) then \\(\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\hat{v}=\\frac{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v})= \\frac{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\vec{v}\\). In this case, \\(k=\\frac{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}>0\\).\nThe Law of Cosines yields \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w} \\|\\cos(\\theta)\\). From Example 11.9.1, we know \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\). Equating these two expressions for \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\) gives \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=\\|\\vec{v} \\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\) which reduces to \\(-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})\\), or \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\), as required. An immediate consequence of Theorem 11.23 is the following.\n**Theorem 11.24**.: Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors and let \\(\\theta\\) the angle between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\). Then\n\\[\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right) =\\arccos(\\hat{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\]\nWe obtain the formula in Theorem 11.24 by solving the equation given in Theorem 11.23 for \\(\\theta\\). Since \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero, so are \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Hence, we may divide both sides of \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\) by \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) to get \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\). Since \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) by definition, the values of \\(\\theta\\) exactly match the range of the arccosine function. Hence, \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\). Using Theorem 11.22, we can rewrite \\(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\| }\\vec{v}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\vec{w}\\right)=\\hat{v}\\cdot \\hat{w}\\), giving us the alternative formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos(\\hat{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\).\nWe are overdue for an example.\n**Example 11.9.2**.: Find the angle between the following pairs of vectors.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNote how little has changed: \\({\\bf k}\\) becomes \\({\\bf N}\\), a unit normal to the surface (just as \\({\\bf k}\\) is a unit normal to the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\)-plane), and \\(dA\\) becomes \\(dS\\), since this is now a general surface integral. The phrase \"counter-clockwise relative to \\({\\bf N}\\)\" means roughly that if we take the direction of \\({\\bf N}\\) to be \"up\", then we go around the boundary counter-clockwise when viewed from \"above\". In many cases, this description is inadequate. A slightly more complicated but general description is this: imagine standing on the side of the surface considered positive; walk to the boundary and turn left. You are now following the boundary in the correct direction.\n**Example 16.8.2**: Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle e^{xy}\\cos z,x^{2}z,xy\\rangle\\) and the surface \\(D\\) be \\(x=\\sqrt{1-y^{2}-z^{2}}\\), oriented in the positive \\(x\\) direction. It quickly becomes apparent that the surface integral in Stokes's Theorem is intractable, so we try the line integral. The boundary of \\(D\\) is the unit circle in the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane, \\({\\bf r}=\\langle 0,\\cos u,\\sin u\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq u\\leq 2\\pi\\). The integral is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\langle e^{xy}\\cos z,x^{2}z,xy\\rangle\\cdot\\langle 0,-\\sin u, \\cos u\\rangle\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}0\\,du=0,\\]\nbecause \\(x=0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 16.8.3** Consider the cylinder \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,v\\rangle\\), \\(0\\leq u\\leq 2\\pi\\), \\(0\\leq v\\leq 2\\), oriented outward, and \\({\\bf F}=\\langle y,zx,xy\\rangle\\).

The normal is \\({\\bf r_{v}}\\times{\\bf r_{u}}=\\langle v,0,0\\rangle\\). We compute the curl:\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\langle x-x^{2},-e^{xy}\\sin z-y,2xz-xe^{xy}\\cos z\\rangle.\\]\nSince \\(x=0\\) everywhere on the surface,\n\\[(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf N}=\\langle 0,-\\sin z-y,0\\rangle\\cdot\\langle v,0,0 \\rangle=0,\\]\nso the surface integral is\n\\[\\int\\limits_{E}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int 0\\,dS=0,\\]\nas before. In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt} +R{dz\\over dt}\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+R\\left({\\partial z \\over\\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt.\\]\nusing the chain rule for \\(dz/dt\\).

(This is exactly what I did in the example: I picked \\(\\delta=0.0000002<0.0000002040816327\\ldots\\).) A similar calculation again works for negative \\(\\Delta x\\). The important fact is that this is now a completely general result--it shows that I can always win, no matter what \"move\" you make.\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like \"the limit of \\((-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2})/\\Delta x\\) as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to zero is \\(-19.6\\),\" and abbreviate this mouthful\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nboth the numerator and denominator approach zero. Typically this difficulty can be resolved when \\(f\\) is a \"nice\" function and we are trying to compute a derivative. Occasionally such limits are interesting for other reasons, and the limit of a fraction in which both numerator and denominator approach zero can be difficult to analyze. Now that we have the derivative available, there is another technique that can sometimes be helpful in such circumstances.\nBefore we introduce the technique, we will also expand our concept of limit, in two ways. When the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) does not exist, it may be useful to note in what way it does not exist. We have already talked about one such case: one-sided limits. Another case is when \"\\(f\\) goes to infinity\". We also will occasionally want to know what happens to \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) \"goes to infinity\".\n**Example 4.10.1**: What happens to \\(1/x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(0\\)? From the right, \\(1/x\\) gets bigger and bigger, or goes to infinity. From the left it goes to negative infinity. \\(\\sqcap\\)__\n**Example 4.10.2**: What happens to the function \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity? It seems clear that as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger, \\(1/x\\) gets closer and closer to zero, so \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) should be getting closer and closer to \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)__\nAs with ordinary limits, these concepts can be made precise. Roughly, we want \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) to mean that we can make \\(f(x)\\) arbitrarily large by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) should mean we can make \\(f(x)\\) as close as we want to \\(L\\) by making \\(x\\) large enough. Compare this definition to the definition of limit in section 2.3, definition 2.3.2.\n**Definition 4.10.3** If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) if for every \\(N>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) such that whenever \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(f(x)>N\\). We can extend this in the obvious ways to define \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=-\\infty\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 4.10.4** Limit at infinity If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(x>N\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We may similarly define \\(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=L\\), and using the idea of the previous definition, we may define \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe include these definitions for completeness, but we will not explore them in detail. Suffice it to say that such limits behave in much the same way that ordinary limits do; in particular there are some analogs of theorem 2.3.6.\nNow consider this limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\pi}{x^{2}-\\pi^{2}\\over\\sin x}.\\]\nAs \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\pi\\), both the numerator and denominator approach zero, so it is not obvious what, if anything, the quotient approaches. We can often compute such limits by application of the following theorem.\n**Theorem 4.10.5** L'Hopital's Rule For \"sufficiently nice\" functions \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=0=\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)\\) or both \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=\\pm\\infty\\), and if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}{f^{\\prime}(x)\\over g^{\\prime}(x)}\\) exists, then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}{f(x)\\over g(x)}=\\lim_{x\\to a}{f^{\\prime}(x)\\over g^{ \\prime}(x)}\\). This remains true if \"\\(x\\to a\\)\" is replaced by \"\\(x\\to\\infty\\)\" or \"\\(x\\to-\\infty\\)\". \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nUsing n=6 approximate the value of $\\int_{-1}^2 \\sqrt{e^{-x^2} + 1} dx$ using the Simpson's rule.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFigure 8.6.3: A parabola (dashed) approximating a curve (solid). (AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 6.4 Linear Approximations\nNewton's method is one example of the usefulness of the tangent line as an approximation to a curve. Here we explore another such application.\nRecall that the tangent line to \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x=a\\) is given by \\(L(x)=f^{\\prime}(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\). The tangent line in this context is also called the **linear approximation** to \\(f\\) at \\(a\\).\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\nFigure 6.4.1: The linear approximation to \\(y=x^{2}\\).\nfunctions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.\n##### Example 6.4.2\nConsider the trigonometric function \\(\\sin x\\). Its linear approximation at \\(x=0\\) is simply \\(L(x)=x\\). When \\(x\\) is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.\n##### Definition 6.4.3\nLet \\(y=f(x)\\) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable \\(dx\\), and a new dependent variable \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\). Notice that \\(dy\\) is a function both of \\(x\\) (since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is a function of \\(x\\)) and of \\(dx\\). We say that \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are **differentials**.\n_Remark._ Up until now, \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) made sense only together, as \\(dy/dx\\), another way to write \\(f^{\\prime}\\). Now we have given them have individual meanings, but notice that since \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\), \\(dy/dx=f^{\\prime}(x)\\), so the new meanings are consistent with the former usage.\nLet \\(\\Delta x=x-a\\) and \\(\\Delta y=f(x)-f(a)\\). If \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\) then \\(\\Delta x\\) is small. If we set \\(dx=\\Delta x\\) then\n\\[dy=f^{\\prime}(a)\\,dx\\approx\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\Delta x=\\Delta y.\\]\nThus, \\(dy\\) can be used to approximate \\(\\Delta y\\), the actual change in the function \\(f\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). This is exactly the approximation given by the tangent line:\n\n\n",

A vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) gives the position of a point in terms of the parameter \\(t\\), which is often time, but need not be. Suppose \\(s\\) is the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use \\(s\\) for the variable, we get \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), the position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has traveled.\n##### Example 13.3.3\nSuppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\). We know that this curve is a circle of radius 1. While \\(t\\) might represent time, it can also in this case represent the usual angle between the positive \\(x\\)-axis and \\({\\bf r}(t)\\). The distance along the circle from \\((1,0,0)\\) to\n\\((\\cos t,\\sin t,0)\\) is also \\(t\\)--this is the definition of radian measure. Thus, in this case \\(s=t\\) and \\({\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos s,\\sin s,0\\rangle\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\n**Example 13.3.4** Suppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\). We know that this curve is a helix. The distance along the helix from \\((1,0,0)\\) to \\((\\cos t,\\sin t,t)\\) is\n\\[s=\\int_{0}^{t}|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(u)|\\,du=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u+\\sin^{2}u+ 1}\\,du=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sqrt{2}\\,du=\\sqrt{2}t.\\]\nThus, the value of \\(t\\) that gets us distance \\(s\\) along the helix is \\(t=s/\\sqrt{2}\\), and so the same curve is given by \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2}),\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2}),s/\\sqrt{2}\\rangle\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nIn general, if we have a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), to convert it to a vector function in terms of arc length we compute\n\\[s=\\int_{a}^{t}|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(u)|\\,du=f(t),\\]\nsolve \\(s=f(t)\\) for \\(t\\), getting \\(t=g(s)\\), and substitute this back into \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) to get \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)={\\bf r}(g(s))\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\nProof of Green's Theorem.: We cannot here prove Green's Theorem in general, but we can do a special case. We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))\\,dt+\\int_{b}^{a}P(t,g_{2 }(t))\\,dt =\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))\\,dt-\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{2}(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))-P(t,g_{2}(t))\\,dt\\]\nwhich is the result of the double integral times \\(-1\\), as desired.\nThe equation involving \\(Q\\) is essentially the same, and left as an exercise.\nExercises 16.4.\n1.

This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the terms \\(a_{n}\\) approach zero, but this does not mean that \\(a_{n}\\geq a_{n+1}\\) for every \\(n\\). Many useful and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to understand. Let's look at an example.\n##### Example 11.3.1\nShow that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges.\nThe terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) are positive and decreasing, and since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1/x^{2}=0\\), the terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number \\(N\\) so that \\(s_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\). The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is inherent in figure 11.\nThe figure shows the graph of \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles.

Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2.

Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\\[{d\\over dx}x={d\\over dx}e^{y}.\\]\nThen using the chain rule on the right hand side:\n\\[1=\\left({d\\over dx}y\\right)e^{y}=y^{\\prime}e^{y}.\\]\nThen we can solve for \\(y^{\\prime}\\):\n\\[y^{\\prime}={1\\over e^{y}}={1\\over x}.\\]\nThere is one little difficulty here. To use the chain rule to compute \\(d/dx(e^{y})=y^{\\prime}e^{y}\\) we need to know that the function \\(y\\)_has_ a derivative. All we have shown is that _if_ it has a derivative then that derivative must be \\(1/x\\). When using this method we will always have to assume that the desired derivative exists, but fortunately this is a safe assumption for most such problems.\nThe example \\(y=\\ln x\\) involved an inverse function defined implicitly, but other functions can be defined implicitly, and sometimes a single equation can be used to implicitly define more than one function. Here's a familiar example. The equation \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) describes a circle of radius \\(r\\). The circle is not a function \\(y=f(x)\\) because for some values of \\(x\\) there are two corresponding values of \\(y\\). If we want to work with a function, we can break the circle into two pieces, the upper and lower semicircles, each of which is a function. Let's call these \\(y=U(x)\\) and \\(y=L(x)\\); in fact this is a fairly simple example, and it's possible to give explicit expressions for these: \\(U(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) and \\(L(x)=-\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) . But it's somewhat easier, and quite useful, to view both functions as given implicitly by \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\): both \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+U(x)^{2}\\) and \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+L(x)^{2}\\) are true, and we can think of \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) as defining both \\(U(x)\\) and \\(L(x)\\).\nNow we can take the derivative of both sides as before, remembering that \\(y\\) is not simply a variable but a function--in this case, \\(y\\) is either \\(U(x)\\) or \\(L(x)\\) but we're not yet specifying which one. When we take the derivative we just have to remember to apply the\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Note.** If you happen to know some \"derivative formulas\" from an earlier course, for the time being you should pretend that you do not know them. In examples like the ones above and the exercises below, you are required to know how to find the derivative\nformula starting from basic principles. We will later develop some formulas so that we do not always need to do such computations, but we will continue to need to know how to do the more involved computations.\nSometimes one encounters a point in the domain of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) where there is _no derivative_, because there is no tangent line. In order for the notion of the tangent line at a point to make sense, the curve must be \"smooth\" at that point. This means that if you imagine a particle traveling at some steady speed along the curve, then the particle does not experience an abrupt change of direction. There are two types of situations you should be aware of--corners and cusps--where there's a sudden change of direction and hence no derivative.\n##### Example 2.4.4\nDiscuss the derivative of the absolute value function \\(y=f(x)=|x|\\).\nIf \\(x\\) is positive, then this is the function \\(y=x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(1\\). (Recall that when \\(y=f(x)=mx+b\\), the derivative is the slope \\(m\\).) If \\(x\\) is negative, then we're dealing with the function \\(y=-x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(-1\\). If \\(x=0\\), then the function has a corner, i.e., there is no tangent line. A tangent line would have to point in the direction of the curve--but there are _two_ directions of the curve that come together at the origin. We can summarize this as\n\\[y^{\\prime}=\\cases{1&if $x>0$;\\cr-1&if $x<0$;\\cr\\hbox{undefined}&if $x=0$.}\\]\n##### Example 2.4.5\nDiscuss the derivative of the function \\(y=x^{2/3}\\), shown in figure 2.4.1. We will later see how to compute this derivative; for now we use the fact that \\(y^{\\prime}=(2/3)x^{-1/3}\\). Visually this looks much like the absolute value function, but it technically has a cusp, not a corner. The absolute value function has no tangent line at \\(0\\) because there are (at least) two obvious contenders--the tangent line of the left side of the curve and the tangent line of the right side. The function \\(y=x^{2/3}\\) does not have a tangent line at \\(0\\), but unlike the absolute value function it can be said to have a single direction: as we approach \\(0\\) from either side the tangent line becomes closer and closer to a vertical line; the curve is vertical at \\(0\\). But as before, if you imagine traveling along the curve, an abrupt change in direction is required at \\(0\\): a full \\(180\\) degree turn.\nIn practice we won't worry much about the distinction between these examples; in both cases the function has a \"sharp point\" where there is no tangent line and no derivative.\n### 2.4 The Derivative\n#### Exercises 2.4.\n* Find the derivative of \\(y=f(x)=\\sqrt{169-x^{2}}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the derivative of \\(y=f(t)=80-4.9t^{2}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the derivative of \\(y=f(x)=x^{2}-(1/x)\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the derivative of \\(y=f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) (where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\n\n",

But really there's nothing special about \\(t=1\\); let's just call it \\(t\\) instead. In this case the approximate distance traveled during time interval number \\(i\\) is \\(3(i-1)(t/n)(t/n)=3(i-1)t^{2}/n^{2}\\), that is, speed \\(3(i-1)(t/n)\\) times time \\(t/n\\), and the total distance traveled is approximately\n\\[(0){t\\over n}+3(1){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}+3(2){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}+3(3){t^{2}\\over n ^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}.\\]\nAs before we can simplify this to\n\\[{3t^{2}\\over n^{2}}(0+1+2+\\cdots+(n-1))={3t^{2}\\over n^{2}}{n^{2}-n\\over 2}={3 \\over 2}t^{2}\\left(1-{1\\over n}\\right).\\]\nIn the limit, as \\(n\\) gets larger, this gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}\\) and the approximated position of the object gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), so the actual position is \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), exactly the answer given by the first approach to the problem. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 7.1.2** Find the area under the curve \\(y=3x\\) between \\(x=0\\) and any positive value \\(x\\). There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,\nbut the second approach works fine. (Because the function \\(y=3x\\) is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and \\(x\\) into \\(n\\) equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let's use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1. The height of rectangle number \\(i\\) is then \\(3(i-1)(x/n)\\), the width is \\(x/n\\), and the area is \\(3(i-1)(x^{2}/n^{2})\\). The total area of the rectangles is\n\\[(0)\\frac{x}{n}+3(1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(2)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(3)\\frac{x^{2} }{n^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}.\\]\nBy factoring out \\(3x^{2}/n^{2}\\) this simplifies to\n\\[\\frac{3x^{2}}{n^{2}}(0+1+2+\\cdots+(n-1))=\\frac{3x^{2}}{n^{2}}\\frac{n^{2}-n}{2} =\\frac{3}{2}x^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets larger this gets closer and closer to \\(3x^{2}/2\\), which must therefore be the true area under the curve. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 7.1.1** Approximating the area under \\(y=3x\\) with rectangles. Drag the slider to change the number of rectangles.\nWhat you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example appears to be much different than the problem in the first example, and while the easy approach to problem one does not appear to apply to problem two, the \"approximation\" approach works in both, and moreover the _calculations are identical_. As we will see, there\nare many, many problems that appear much different on the surface but that turn out to be the same as these problems, in the sense that when we try to approximate solutions we end up with mathematics that looks like the two examples, though of course the function involved will not always be so simple.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWhat you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example appears to be much different than the problem in the first example, and while the easy approach to problem one does not appear to apply to problem two, the \"approximation\" approach works in both, and moreover the _calculations are identical_.

The reasoning is this: we know that problem one can be solved easily by finding a function whose derivative is \\(3t\\). We also know that mathematically the two problems are the same, because both can be solved by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore, we don't really need to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer by computing a function with the derivative \\(3t\\) or, which is the same thing, \\(3x\\).\nIt's true that the first problem had the added complication of the \"10\", and we certainly need to be able to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple. The lesson then is this: whenever we can solve a problem by taking the limit of a sum of a certain form, we can instead of computing the (often nasty) limit find a new function with a certain derivative.\n#### Exercises 7.1\n1.

Not surprisingly, non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more general equations.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) is a function of two variables. A more general class of first order differential equations has the form \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\). This is not necessarily a linear first order equation, since \\(\\phi\\) may depend on \\(y\\) in some complicated way; note however that \\(\\dot{y}\\) appears in a very simple form. Under suitable conditions on the function \\(\\phi\\), it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable property.\n##### Example 17.4.1\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\) is a first order non-linear equation, because \\(y\\) appears to the second power. We will not be able to solve this equation. \\(\\Box\\)\n##### Example 17.4.2\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\nNot all differential equations that are important in practice can be solved exactly, so techniques have been developed to approximate solutions. We describe one such technique, **Euler's Method**, which is simple though not particularly useful compared to some more sophisticated techniques.\nSuppose we wish to approximate a solution to the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\), \\(y(t_{0})=y_{0}\\), for \\(t\\geq t_{0}\\). Under reasonable conditions on \\(\\phi\\), we know the solution exists, represented by a curve in the \\(t\\)-\\(y\\) plane; call this solution \\(f(t)\\). The point \\((t_{0},y_{0})\\) is of course on this curve. We also know the slope of the curve at this point, namely \\(\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\). If we follow the tangent line for a brief distance, we arrive at a point that should be almost on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), namely \\((t_{0}+\\Delta t,y_{0}+\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\Delta t)\\); call this point \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). Now we pretend, in effect, that this point really is on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), in which case we again know the slope of the curve through \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\), namely \\(\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\). So we can compute a new point, \\((t_{2},y_{2})=(t_{1}+\\Delta t,y_{1}+\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\Delta t)\\) that is a little farther along, still close to the graph of \\(f(t)\\) but probably not quite so close as \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). We can continue in this way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have an approximation \\((t_{n},y_{n})\\) for whatever time \\(t_{n}\\) we need. At each step we do essentially the same calculation, namely\n\\[(t_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(t_{i}+\\Delta t,y_{i}+\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\Delta t).\\]\nWe expect that smaller time steps \\(\\Delta t\\) will give better approximations, but of course it will require more work to compute to a specified time. It is possible to compute a guaranteed\nupper bound on how far off the approximation might be, that is, how far \\(y_{n}\\) is from \\(f(t_{n})\\). Suffice it to say that the bound is not particularly good and that there are other more complicated approximation techniques that do better.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+36y=6e^{-6t}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-8\\dot{y}+16y=-2e^{4t}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+6\\dot{y}+5y=4\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-12y=t\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+5y=8\\sin(2t)\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-4y=4e^{2t}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Solve the initial value problem.\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-y=3t+5\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+9y=4t\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+37y=10e^{-4t}\\), \\(y(0)=4\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+6\\dot{y}+18y=\\cos t-\\sin t\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(\\ddot{y}+4\\dot{y}+29y=689\\cos(2t)\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\).

This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\nThe first two terms in parentheses are zero because \\(y_{1}\\) and \\(y_{2}\\) are solutions to the associated homogeneous equation. Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\nIf we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get\n\\[\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t\\] \\[\\dot{v} =e^{-3t}\\sin t\\] \\[v =-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-3t},\\]\nusing integration by parts. Then from the first equation:\n\\[\\dot{u} =-e^{-2t}\\dot{v}e^{3t}=-e^{-2t}e^{-3t}\\sin(t)e^{3t}=-e^{-2t}\\sin t\\] \\[u =\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-2t}.\\]\n### Second Order Linear Equations, take two\nNow the particular solution we seek is\n\\[ue^{2t}+ve^{3t} =\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-2t}e^{2t}-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t )e^{-3t}e^{3t}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{10}(\\sin t+\\cos t),\\]\n\n\n",

But really there's nothing special about \\(t=1\\); let's just call it \\(t\\) instead. In this case the approximate distance traveled during time interval number \\(i\\) is \\(3(i-1)(t/n)(t/n)=3(i-1)t^{2}/n^{2}\\), that is, speed \\(3(i-1)(t/n)\\) times time \\(t/n\\), and the total distance traveled is approximately\n\\[(0){t\\over n}+3(1){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}+3(2){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}+3(3){t^{2}\\over n ^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}.\\]\nAs before we can simplify this to\n\\[{3t^{2}\\over n^{2}}(0+1+2+\\cdots+(n-1))={3t^{2}\\over n^{2}}{n^{2}-n\\over 2}={3 \\over 2}t^{2}\\left(1-{1\\over n}\\right).\\]\nIn the limit, as \\(n\\) gets larger, this gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}\\) and the approximated position of the object gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), so the actual position is \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), exactly the answer given by the first approach to the problem. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 7.1.2** Find the area under the curve \\(y=3x\\) between \\(x=0\\) and any positive value \\(x\\). There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,\nbut the second approach works fine. (Because the function \\(y=3x\\) is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and \\(x\\) into \\(n\\) equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let's use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1. The height of rectangle number \\(i\\) is then \\(3(i-1)(x/n)\\), the width is \\(x/n\\), and the area is \\(3(i-1)(x^{2}/n^{2})\\). The total area of the rectangles is\n\\[(0)\\frac{x}{n}+3(1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(2)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}+3(3)\\frac{x^{2} }{n^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1)\\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}}.\\]\nBy factoring out \\(3x^{2}/n^{2}\\) this simplifies to\n\\[\\frac{3x^{2}}{n^{2}}(0+1+2+\\cdots+(n-1))=\\frac{3x^{2}}{n^{2}}\\frac{n^{2}-n}{2} =\\frac{3}{2}x^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets larger this gets closer and closer to \\(3x^{2}/2\\), which must therefore be the true area under the curve. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 7.1.1** Approximating the area under \\(y=3x\\) with rectangles. Drag the slider to change the number of rectangles.\nWhat you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example appears to be much different than the problem in the first example, and while the easy approach to problem one does not appear to apply to problem two, the \"approximation\" approach works in both, and moreover the _calculations are identical_. As we will see, there\nare many, many problems that appear much different on the surface but that turn out to be the same as these problems, in the sense that when we try to approximate solutions we end up with mathematics that looks like the two examples, though of course the function involved will not always be so simple.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWhat you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example appears to be much different than the problem in the first example, and while the easy approach to problem one does not appear to apply to problem two, the \"approximation\" approach works in both, and moreover the _calculations are identical_.

The reasoning is this: we know that problem one can be solved easily by finding a function whose derivative is \\(3t\\). We also know that mathematically the two problems are the same, because both can be solved by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore, we don't really need to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer by computing a function with the derivative \\(3t\\) or, which is the same thing, \\(3x\\).\nIt's true that the first problem had the added complication of the \"10\", and we certainly need to be able to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple. The lesson then is this: whenever we can solve a problem by taking the limit of a sum of a certain form, we can instead of computing the (often nasty) limit find a new function with a certain derivative.\n#### Exercises 7.1\n1.

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it).

If it converges, compute the limit. We compute\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln x}{x}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1/x}{1}=0,\\]\nusing L'Hopital's Rule. Thus the sequence converges to \\(0\\).\n**Example 11.1.7**.: Determine whether \\(\\{(-1)^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. This does not make sense for all real exponents, but the sequence is easy to understand: it is\n\\[1,-1,1,-1,1\\ldots\\]\nand clearly diverges.\n**Example 11.1.8**.: Determine whether \\(\\{(-1/2)^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. We consider the sequence \\(\\{|(-1/2)^{n}|\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}=\\{(1/2)^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\). Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x}=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{2^{x} }=0,\\]\nso by theorem 11.1.4 the sequence converges to \\(0\\).\n**Example 11.1.9**  Determine whether \\(\\{(\\sin n)/\\sqrt{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges. If it converges, compute the limit. Since \\(|\\sin n|\\leq 1\\), \\(0\\leq|\\sin n/\\sqrt{n}|\\leq 1/\\sqrt{n}\\) and we can use theorem 11.1.3 with \\(a_{n}=0\\) and \\(c_{n}=1/\\sqrt{n}\\). Since \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=0\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sin n/\\sqrt{n}=0\\) and the sequence converges to \\(0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.1.10**  A particularly common and useful sequence is \\(\\{r^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\), for various values of \\(r\\). Some are quite easy to understand: If \\(r=1\\) the sequence converges to \\(1\\) since every term is \\(1\\), and likewise if \\(r=0\\) the sequence converges to \\(0\\). If \\(r=-1\\) this is the sequence of example 11.1.7 and diverges. If \\(r>1\\) or \\(r<-1\\) the terms \\(r^{n}\\) get large without limit, so the sequence diverges. If \\(0<r<1\\) then the sequence converges to \\(0\\). If \\(-1<r<0\\) then \\(|r^{n}|=|r|^{n}\\) and \\(0<|r|<1\\), so the sequence \\(\\{|r|^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges to \\(0\\), so also \\(\\{r^{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges to \\(0\\). converges. In summary, \\(\\{r^{n}\\}\\) converges precisely when \\(-1<r\\leq 1\\) in which case\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}r^{n}=\\cases{0&if $-1<r<1$\\cr 1&if $r=1$}\\]\nSometimes we will not be able to determine the limit of a sequence, but we still would like to know whether it converges. In some cases we can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.\nA sequence is called **increasing** or sometimes **strictly increasing** if \\(a_{i}<a_{i+1}\\) for all \\(i\\). It is called **non-decreasing** or sometimes (unfortunately) **increasing** if \\(a_{i}\\leq a_{i+1}\\) for all \\(i\\). Similarly a sequence is **decreasing** if \\(a_{i}>a_{i+1}\\) for all \\(i\\) and **non-increasing** if \\(a_{i}\\geq a_{i+1}\\) for all \\(i\\). If a sequence has any of these properties it is called **monotonic**.\n**Example 11.1.11**  The sequence\n\\[\\left\\{{2^{i}-1\\over 2^{i}}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}={1\\over 2},{3\\over 4},{7 \\over 8},{15\\over 16},\\ldots,\\]\nis increasing, and\n\\[\\left\\{{n+1\\over n}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}={2\\over 1},{3\\over 2},{4\\over 3},{5 \\over 4},\\ldots\\]\nis decreasing. \\(\\Box\\)\nA sequence is **bounded above** if there is some number \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\), and **bounded below** if there is some number \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{n}\\geq N\\) for every \\(n\\). If a sequence is bounded above and bounded below it is **bounded**. If a sequence \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by \\(a_{0}\\)), and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is bounded above (by \\(a_{0}\\)). Finally, with all this new terminology we can state an important theorem.\n**Theorem 11.1.12** If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n\n\n",

For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\).

But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots.

The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\nWe already know one case, not particularly interesting, in which this theorem is true: If \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, we know that the integral \\(\\oint_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=0\\), because any integral of a conservative vector field around a closed curve is zero. We also know in this case that \\(\\partial P/\\partial y=\\partial Q/\\partial x\\), so the double integral in the theorem is simply the integral of the zero function, namely, \\(0\\). So in the case that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, the theorem says simply that \\(0=0\\).\n**Example 16.4.2**: We illustrate the theorem by computing both sides of\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA,\\]\nwhere \\(D\\) is the triangular region with corners \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\).\nStarting with the double integral:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1-x}y\\,dy\\,dx= \\int_{0}^{1}{(1-x)^{2}\\over 2}\\,dx=\\left.-{(1-x)^{3}\\over 6}\\right|_{0}^{1}={1 \\over 6}.\\]\nThere is no single formula to describe the boundary of \\(D\\), so to compute the left side directly we need to compute three separate integrals corresponding to the three sides of the triangle, and each of these integrals we break into two integrals, the \"\\(dx\\)\" part and the \"\\(dy\\)\" part. The three sides are described by \\(y=0\\), \\(y=1-x\\), and \\(x=0\\). The integrals are then\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{\\partial D}\\!\\!x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0} ^{0}0\\,dy+\\int_{1}^{0}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)y\\,dy+\\int_{0}^{0}0\\,dx+\\int_ {1}^{0}0\\,dy\\cr&={1\\over 5}+0-{1\\over 5}+{1\\over 6}+0+0={1\\over 6}.\\cr}\\]\nAlternately, we could describe the three sides in vector form as \\(\\langle t,0\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1-t,t\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle 0,1-t\\rangle\\). Note that in each case, as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), we follow the corresponding side\nin the correct direction. Now\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}+t\\cdot 0\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt+ \\int_{0}^{1}0+0\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt=\\frac{1}{ 6}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute.

In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\). If we can find \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) so that \\(\\partial Q/\\partial x-\\partial P/\\partial y=1\\), then the area is also\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy.\\]\nIt is quite easy to do this: \\(P=0,Q=x\\) works, as do \\(P=-y,Q=0\\) and \\(P=-y/2,Q=x/2\\).\n##### Example 16.4.3\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\nProof of Green's Theorem.: We cannot here prove Green's Theorem in general, but we can do a special case. We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\n\n\n",

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it). Using the root test:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSo these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the **integral test**, which we state as a theorem.\n**Theorem 11.3.3** Suppose that \\(f(x)>0\\) and is decreasing on the infinite interval \\([k,\\infty)\\) (for some \\(k\\geq 1\\)) and that \\(a_{n}=f(n)\\). Then the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges if and only if the improper integral \\(\\int_{1}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,dx\\) converges.\nThe two examples we have seen are called \\(p\\)-series; a \\(p\\)-series is any series of the form \\(\\sum 1/n^{p}\\). If \\(p\\leq 0\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}1/n^{p}\\neq 0\\), so the series diverges. For positive values of \\(p\\) we can determine precisely which series converge.\n**Theorem 11.3.4** A \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>0\\) converges if and only if \\(p>1\\).\n_Proof._ We use the integral test; we have already done \\(p=1\\), so assume that \\(p\\neq 1\\).\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{p}}\\,dx=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{x^{1-p}\\over 1-p}\\bigg{|} _{1}^{D}=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{D^{1-p}\\over 1-p}-{1\\over 1-p}.\\]\nIf \\(p>1\\) then \\(1-p<0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=0\\), so the integral converges. If \\(0<p<1\\) then \\(1-p>0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=\\infty\\), so the integral diverges.\n**Example 11.3.5** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{3}}\\) converges.\nWe could of course use the integral test, but now that we have the theorem we may simply note that this is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>1\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.6** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{n^{4}}\\) converges.\nWe know that if \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) converges then \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) also converges, by theorem 11.2.2. Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) is a convergent \\(p\\)-series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) converges also. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.7** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) diverges.\nThis also follows from theorem 11.2.2: Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p=1/2<1\\), it diverges, and so does \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSince it is typically difficult to compute the value of a series exactly, a good approximation is frequently required. In a real sense, a good approximation is only as good as we know it is, that is, while an approximation may in fact be good, it is only valuable in practice if we can guarantee its accuracy to some degree. This guarantee is usually easy to come by for series with decreasing positive terms.\n**Example 11.3.8** Approximate \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) to two decimal places.\nReferring to figure 11.3.1, if we approximate the sum by \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}1/n^{2}\\), the error we make is the total area of the remaining rectangles, all of which lie under the curve \\(1/x^{2}\\) from \\(x=N\\) out to infinity. So we know the true value of the series is larger than the approximation, and no bigger than the approximation plus the area under the curve from \\(N\\) to infinity. Roughly, then, we need to find \\(N\\) so that\n\\[\\int_{N}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\,dx<1/100.\\]\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nWe can compute the integral:\n\\[\\int_{N}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\,dx=\\frac{1}{N},\\]\nso \\(N=100\\) is a good starting point. Adding up the first 100 terms gives approximately \\(1.634983900\\), and that plus \\(1/100\\) is \\(1.644983900\\), so approximating the series by the value halfway between these will be at most \\(1/200=0.005\\) in error. The midpoint is \\(1.639983900\\), but while this is correct to \\(\\pm 0.005\\), we can't tell if the correct two-decimal approximation is \\(1.63\\) or \\(1.64\\). We need to make \\(N\\) big enough to reduce the guaranteed error, perhaps to around \\(0.004\\) to be safe, so we would need \\(1/N\\approx 0.008\\), or \\(N=125\\). Now the sum of the first 125 terms is approximately \\(1.636965982\\), and that plus \\(0.008\\) is \\(1.644965982\\) and the point halfway between them is \\(1.640965982\\). The true value is then \\(1.640965982\\pm 0.004\\), and all numbers in this range round to \\(1.64\\), so \\(1.64\\) is correct to two decimal places. We have mentioned that the true value of this series can be shown to be \\(\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.644934068\\) which rounds down to \\(1.64\\) (just barely) and is indeed below the upper bound of \\(1.644965982\\), again just barely. Frequently approximations will be even better than the \"guaranteed\" accuracy, but not always, as this example demonstrates. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\nThe first two terms in parentheses are zero because \\(y_{1}\\) and \\(y_{2}\\) are solutions to the associated homogeneous equation. Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\nIf we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get\n\\[\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t\\] \\[\\dot{v} =e^{-3t}\\sin t\\] \\[v =-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-3t},\\]\nusing integration by parts. Then from the first equation:\n\\[\\dot{u} =-e^{-2t}\\dot{v}e^{3t}=-e^{-2t}e^{-3t}\\sin(t)e^{3t}=-e^{-2t}\\sin t\\] \\[u =\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-2t}.\\]\n### Second Order Linear Equations, take two\nNow the particular solution we seek is\n\\[ue^{2t}+ve^{3t} =\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-2t}e^{2t}-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t )e^{-3t}e^{3t}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{10}(\\sin t+\\cos t),\\]\nand the solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}+(\\sin t+\\cos t)/10\\). For comparison (and practice) you might want to solve this using the method of undetermined coefficients. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 17.3 First Order Linear Equations\nAs you might guess, a first order linear differential equation has the form \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Not only is this closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Let \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\nFinally we substitute to find \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}+A(1)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{6}+A\\] \\[A=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThe solution is then\n\\[y=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}t^{-3}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nHere is an alternate method for finding a particular solution to the differential equation, using an **integrating factor**. In the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), we note that if we multiply through by a function \\(I(t)\\) to get \\(I(t)\\dot{y}+I(t)p(t)y=I(t)f(t)\\), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product rule:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(I(t)y)=I(t)\\dot{y}+I^{\\prime}(t)y.\\]\nNow if we could choose \\(I(t)\\) so that \\(I^{\\prime}(t)=I(t)p(t)\\), this would be exactly the left hand side of the differential equation. But this is just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution is \\(I(t)=e^{Q(t)}\\), where \\(Q(t)=\\int p\\,dt\\); note that \\(Q(t)=-P(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) appears in the variation of parameters method and \\(P^{\\prime}(t)=-p\\). Now the modified differential equation is\n\\[e^{-P(t)}\\dot{y}+e^{-P(t)}p(t)y =e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-P(t)}y) =e^{-P(t)}f(t).\\]\nIntegrating both sides gives\n\\[e^{-P(t)}y =\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt\\] \\[y =e^{P(t)}\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\n\n\n",

Did you find an attribute common to those functions that did succeed? You should have, because there is only one extremely special family of functions that actually works here. Thus we return to our previous statement, **in general**, \\(f(a+b)\\neq f(a)+f(b)\\).\n#### 1.4 Function Notation\n1. \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x+3}{4}\\) Domain: \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 4.3 A hard limit\nWe want to compute this limit:\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin\\Delta x}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nEquivalently, to make the notation a bit simpler, we can compute\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}.\\]\nIn the original context we need to keep \\(x\\) and \\(\\Delta x\\) separate, but here it doesn't hurt to rename \\(\\Delta x\\) to something more convenient.\nTo do this we need to be quite clever, and to employ some indirect reasoning. The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\n\n",

Calculate the Riemann Sum S_{3,2} for \\int \\int_{R} xy dA for the integral, using the lower-left vertex of rectangles as sample points.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe following theorem presents some general properties of summation notation. While we shall not have much need of these properties in Algebra, they do play a great role in Calculus. Moreover, there is much to be learned by thinking about why the properties hold. We invite the reader to prove these results. To get started, remember, \"When in doubt, write it out!\"\n**Theorem 9.1**.: **Properties of Summation Notation:** Suppose \\(\\{a_{n}\\}\\) and \\(\\{b_{n}\\}\\) are sequences so that the following sums are defined.\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}\\left(a_{n}\\pm b_{n}\\right)=\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}\\pm \\sum_{n=m}^{p}b_{n}\\)\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}c\\,a_{n}=c\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}\\), for any real number \\(c\\).\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}=\\sum_{n=m}^{j}a_{n}+\\sum_{n=j+1}^{p}a_{n}\\), for any natural number \\(m\\leq j<j+1\\leq p\\).\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}=\\sum_{n=m+r}^{p+r}a_{n-r}\\), for any whole number \\(r\\).\nWe now turn our attention to the sums involving arithmetic and geometric sequences. Given an arithmetic sequence \\(a_{k}=a+(k-1)d\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\), we let \\(S\\) denote the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms. To derive a formula for \\(S\\), we write it out in two different ways\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}S&=&a&+&(a+d)&+&\\ldots&+&(a+(n-2)d)&+&(a+(n-1)d) \\\\ S&=&(a+(n-1)d)&+&(a+(n-2)d)&+&\\ldots&+&(a+d)&+&a\\end{array}\\]\nIf we add these two equations and combine the terms which are aligned vertically, we get\n\\[2S=(2a+(n-1)d)+(2a+(n-1)d)+\\ldots+(2a+(n-1)d)+(2a+(n-1)d)\\]\nThe right hand side of this equation contains \\(n\\) terms, all of which are equal to \\((2a+(n-1)d)\\) so we get \\(2S=n(2a+(n-1)d)\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2, we obtain the formula\n\\[S=\\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)\\]\nIf we rewrite the quantity \\(2a+(n-1)d\\) as \\(a+(a+(n-1)d)=a_{1}+a_{n}\\), we get the formula\n\\[S=n\\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}\\right)\\]\nA helpful way to remember this last formula is to recognize that we have expressed the sum as the product of the number of terms \\(n\\) and the _average_ of the first and \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) terms.\nTo derive the formula for the geometric sum, we start with a geometric sequence \\(a_{k}=ar^{k-1}\\), \\(k\\geq 1\\), and let \\(S\\) once again denote the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms. Comparing \\(S\\) and \\(rS\\), we get\n\\[\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}S&=&a&+&ar&+&ar^{2}&+&\\ldots&+&ar^{n-2}&+&ar^{n -1}\\\\ rS&=&&&ar&+&ar^{2}&+&\\ldots&+&ar^{n-2}&+&ar^{n-1}&+&ar^{n}\\end{array}\\]\nSubtracting the second equation from the first forces all of the terms except \\(a\\) and \\(ar^{n}\\) to cancel out and we get \\(S-rS=a-ar^{n}\\). Factoring, we get \\(S(1-r)=a\\,(1-r^{n})\\). Assuming \\(r\\neq 1\\), we can divide both sides by the quantity \\((1-r)\\) to obtain\n\\[S=a\\left(\\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\\right)\\]\nIf we distribute \\(a\\) through the numerator, we get \\(a-ar^{n}=a_{1}-a_{n+1}\\) which yields the formula\n\\[S=\\frac{a_{1}-a_{n+1}}{1-r}\\]\nIn the case when \\(r=1\\), we get the formula\n\\[S=\\underbrace{a+a+\\ldots+a}_{n\\text{ times}}=n\\,a\\]\nOur results are summarized below.\n**Equation 9.2**.: **Sums of Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences:**\n* The sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence \\(a_{k}=a+(k-1)d\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) is \\[S=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}=n\\left(\\frac{a_{{}_{1}}+a_{n}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n -1)d)\\]\n* The sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric sequence \\(a_{k}=ar^{k-1}\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\) is \\[1.\\ S=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}=\\frac{a_{1}-a_{n+1}}{1-r}=a\\left(\\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r }\\right)\\text{, if }r\\neq 1.\\] \\[2.\\ S=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a=na\\text{, if }r=1.\\]\nWhile we have made an honest effort to derive the formulas in Equation 9.2, formal proofs require the machinery in Section 9.3. An application of the arithmetic sum formula which proves useful in Calculus results in formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers. The natural numbers themselves are a sequence4\\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), ...which is arithmetic with \\(a=d=1\\). Applying Equation 9.2,\nFootnote 4: This is the identity function on the natural numbers!\n\\[1+2+3+\\ldots+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 11.7.4**.: Use Theorem 11.17 to find the following:\n1. both square roots of \\(z=-2+2i\\sqrt{3}\\)\n2. the four fourth roots of \\(z=-16\\)\n3. the three cube roots of \\(z=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\)\n4. the five fifth roots of \\(z=1\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. We start by writing \\(z=-2+2i\\sqrt{3}=4\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\). To use Theorem 11.17, we identify \\(r=4\\), \\(\\theta=\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3}\\) and \\(n=2\\). We know that \\(z\\) has two square roots, and in keeping with the notation in Theorem 11.17, we'll call them \\(w_{0}\\) and \\(w_{1}\\). We get \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt{4}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{(2\\pi/3)}{2}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{2}(0)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt{4}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{(2\\pi/3)}{2}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{2}(1)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\right)\\). In rectangular form, the two square roots of \\(z\\) are \\(w_{0}=1+i\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(w_{1}=-1-i\\sqrt{3}\\). We can check our answers by squaring them and showing that we get \\(z=-2+2i\\sqrt{3}\\).\n2. Proceeding as above, we get \\(z=-16=16\\mathrm{cis}(\\pi)\\). With \\(r=16\\), \\(\\theta=\\pi\\) and \\(n=4\\), we get the four fourth roots of \\(z\\) to be \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(0)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(1)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(2)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{3}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(3)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). Converting these to rectangular form gives \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(w_{1}=-\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(w_{2}=-\\sqrt{2}-i\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}=\\sqrt{2}-i\\sqrt{2}\\).\n3. For \\(z=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), we have \\(z=2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). With \\(r=2\\), \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(n=3\\) the usual computations yield \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)\\), \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{12}\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{ cis}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{2}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\right)\\). If we were to convert these to rectangular form, we would need to use either the Sum and Difference Identities in Theorem 10.16 or the Half-Angle Identities in Theorem 10.19 to evaluate \\(w_{0}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\). Since we are not explicitly told to do so, we leave this as a good, but messy, exercise.\n4. To find the five fifth roots of \\(1\\), we write \\(1=1\\mathrm{cis}(0)\\). We have \\(r=1\\), \\(\\theta=0\\) and \\(n=5\\). Since \\(\\sqrt[5]{1}=1\\), the roots are \\(w_{0}=\\mathrm{cis}(0)=1\\), \\(w_{1}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{3}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{5}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{4}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{8\\pi}{5}\\right)\\). The situation here is even graver than in the previous example, since we have not developed any identities to help us determine the cosine or sine of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\). At this stage, we could approximate our answers using a calculator, and we leave this as an exercise.\nNow that we have done some computations using Theorem 11.17, we take a step back to look at things geometrically. Essentially, Theorem 11.17 says that to find the \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) roots of a complex number, we first take the \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) root of the modulus and divide the argument by \\(n\\). This gives the first root \\(w_{0}\\). Each succeessive root is found by adding \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\) to the argument, which amounts to rotating \\(w_{0}\\) by \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\) radians. This results in \\(n\\) roots, spaced equally around the complex plane. As an example of this, we plot our answers to number \\(2\\) in Example 11.7.4 below.\nWe have only glimpsed at the beauty of the complex numbers in this section. The complex plane is without a doubt one of the most important mathematical constructs ever devised. Coupled with Calculus, it is the venue for incredibly important Science and Engineering applications.14 For now, the following exercises will have to suffice.\nFootnote 14: For more on this, see the beautifully written epilogue to Section 3.4 found on page 294.\n#### 11.7.1 Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 20, find a polar representation for the complex number \\(z\\) and then identify \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)\\), \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\), \\(|z|\\), \\(\\arg(z)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)\\).\n1. \\(z=9+9i\\) \\(z=5+5i\\sqrt{3}\\) \\(z=6i\\) \\(z=-3\\sqrt{2}+3i\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n\n",

Since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\), we can find the domain of \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\) by setting the argument of the arccosine, in this case \\(\\frac{x}{5}\\), between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). Solving \\(-1\\leq\\frac{x}{5}\\leq 1\\) gives \\(-5\\leq x\\leq 5\\), so the domain is \\([-5,5]\\). To determine the range of \\(f\\), we take a cue from Section 1.7. Three 'key' points on the graph of \\(F(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) are \\((-1,\\pi)\\), \\(\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) and \\((1,0)\\) . Following the procedure outlined in Theorem 1.7, we track these points to \\(\\left(-5,-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,0)\\) and \\(\\left(5,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Plotting these values tells us that the range5 of \\(f\\) is \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\). Our graph confirms our results. Footnote 5: It also confirms our domain!\n2. To find the domain and range of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\), we note that since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x\\) is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers. To determine the range of \\(f\\), we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7. Choosing our 'key' point to be \\((0,0)\\) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we find that the graph of \\(y=f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) differs from the graph of \\(y=F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) by a horizontal compression by a factor of \\(4\\) and a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\). It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of \\(\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We confirm our findings on the calculator below. 3. To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\nHence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(g(x)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi\\). What about \\(x=0\\)? We know \\(g(0)=\\operatorname{arccot}(0)+\\pi=\\pi\\), and neither of the formulas for \\(g\\) involving arctangent will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph \\(y=g(x)\\) on our calculators, we need to write it as a piecewise defined function:\nFootnote 6: Without Calculus, of course ...\n\\[g(x)=\\operatorname{arccot}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[] {rl}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi,&\\text{if }x<0\\\\ \\pi,&\\text{if }x=0\\\\ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi,&\\text{if }x>0\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nfrom figure 12.6.4, viewed now so that the arrow marked \\(r\\) in the original graph appears as the horizontal \"axis\" in the left hand graph. From this diagram it is easy to see that the \\(z\\) coordinate is \\(\\rho\\cos\\phi\\), and that \\(r=\\rho\\sin\\phi\\), as shown. Thus, in converting from rectangular to spherical coordinates we will replace \\(z\\) by \\(\\rho\\cos\\phi\\). To see the substitutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we now view the same point from above, as shown in the right hand graph. The hypotenuse of the triangle in the right hand graph is \\(r=\\rho\\sin\\phi\\), so the sides of the triangle, as shown, are \\(x=r\\cos\\theta=\\rho\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(y=r\\sin\\theta=\\rho\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\).

The associated sine curve, \\(y=\\frac{\\sin(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\), is dotted in as a reference.\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) as read from the graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.\nThe properties of the tangent and cotangent functions are summarized below. As with Theorem 10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.\n**Theorem 10.25**. **Properties of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions**\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n4. As in the previous example, we let \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) so that \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) for some \\(t\\) where \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\). Since \\(\\cos(t)<0\\), we can narrow this down a bit and conclude that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\pi\\), so that \\(t\\) corresponds to an angle in Quadrant II. In terms of \\(t\\), then, we need to find \\(\\sin\\left(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)=\\sin(t)\\). Using the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\), we get \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\) or \\(\\sin(t)=\\pm\\frac{4}{5}\\). Since \\(t\\) corresponds to a Quadrants II angle, we choose \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{4}{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\sin\\left(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n5. We begin this problem in the same manner we began the previous two problems. To help us see the forest for the trees, we let \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\), so our goal is to find a way to express \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\tan(t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\), we know \\(\\cos(t)=x\\) where \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\), but since we are after an expression for \\(\\tan(t)\\), we know we need to throw out \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) from consideration. Hence, either \\(0\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t\\leq\\pi\\) so that, geometrically, \\(t\\) corresponds to an angle in Quadrant I or Quadrant II. One approach3 to finding \\(\\tan(t)\\) is to use the quotient identity \\(\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\cos(t)}\\). Substituting \\(\\cos(t)=x\\) into the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\) gives \\(x^{2}+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\), from which we get \\(\\sin(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Since \\(t\\) corresponds to angles in Quadrants I and II, \\(\\sin(t)\\geq 0\\), so we choose \\(\\sin(t)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Thus, Footnote 3: Alternatively, we could use the identity: \\(1+\\tan^{2}(t)=\\sec^{2}(t)\\). Since \\(x=\\cos(t)\\), \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}=\\frac{1}{x}\\). The reader is invited to work through this approach to see what, if any, difficulties arise. \\[\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\cos(t)}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\] To determine the values of \\(x\\) for which this equivalence is valid, we consider our substitution \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\). Since the domain of \\(\\arccos(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\), we know we must restrict \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). Additionally, since we had to discard \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we need to discard \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). Hence, \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\) is valid for \\(x\\) in \\([-1,0)\\cup(0,1]\\).\n4. We proceed as in the previous problem by writing \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\) so that \\(t\\) lies in the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=x\\). We aim to express \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=\\cos(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(\\cos(2t)\\) is defined everywhere, we get no additional restrictions on \\(t\\) as we did in the previous problem. We have three choices for rewriting \\(\\cos(2t)\\): \\(\\cos^{2}(t)-\\sin^{2}(t)\\), \\(2\\cos^{2}(t)-1\\) and \\(1-2\\sin^{2}(t)\\). Since we know \\(x=\\sin(t)\\), it is easiest to use the last form: \\[\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=\\cos(2t)=1-2\\sin^{2}(t)=1-2x^{2}\\]\nTo find the restrictions on \\(x\\), we once again appeal to our substitution \\(t=\\arcsin(x)\\). Since \\(\\arcsin(x)\\) is defined only for \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\), the equivalence \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=1-2x^{2}\\) is valid only on \\([-1,1]\\).\nA few remarks about Example 10.6.1 are in order. Most of the common errors encountered in dealing with the inverse circular functions come from the need to restrict the domains of the original functions so that they are one-to-one. One instance of this phenomenon is the fact that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) as opposed to \\(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\). This is the exact same phenomenon discussed in Section 5.2 when we saw \\(\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}}=2\\) as opposed to \\(-2\\). Additionally, even though the expression we arrived at in part 2b above, namely \\(1-2x^{2}\\), is defined for all real numbers, the equivalence \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=1-2x^{2}\\) is valid for only \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). This is akin to the fact that while the expression \\(x\\) is defined for all real numbers, the equivalence \\(\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^{2}=x\\) is valid only for \\(x\\geq 0\\). For this reason, it pays to be careful when we determine the intervals where such equivalences are valid.\n\n\n",

The complication in solving an equation like \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=4\\) comes not from the argument of secant, which is just \\(x\\), but rather, the fact the secant is being squared. To get this equation to look like one of the forms listed on page 857, we extract square roots to get \\(\\sec(x)=\\pm 2\\). Converting to cosines, we have \\(\\cos(x)=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\). For \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). For \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). If we take a step back and think of these families of solutions geometrically, we see we are finding the measures of all angles with a reference angle of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). As a result, these solutions can be combined and we may write our solutions as \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of solutions, we note that, depending on the integer \\(k\\), \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right)\\) doesn't always equal \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\). However, it is true that for all integers \\(k\\), \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right)=\\pm\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\pm 2\\). (Can you show this?)

To confirm graphically, we use\na reciprocal identity to rewrite the secant as cosine. The \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=4\\) verify our answers. \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=0}\\)\\(y=\\frac{1}{\\cos^{2}(x)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=4}\\)\n5. The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check, we note \\[\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of tangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= -3\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2})}\\] To determine which of our answers lie in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we first need to get an idea of the value of \\(2\\arctan(-3)\\). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\). Since this is outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we discard \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\) and all solutions of the form \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for \\(k>2\\). Graphically, we see \\(y=\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\) and \\(y=-3\\) intersect only once on \\([0,2\\pi)\\) at \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\approx 3.7851\\). Footnote 5: Your instructor will let you know if you should abandon the analytic route at this point and use your calculator. But seriously, what fun would that be?\n6. To solve \\(\\sin(2x)=0.87\\), we first note that it has the form \\(\\sin(u)=0.87\\), which has the family of solutions \\(u=\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\pi-\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of sine here is \\(2x\\), we get \\(2x=\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\pi-\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).

We choose to track the values \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(2\\pi\\). These 'quarter marks' correspond to quadrantal angles, and as such, mark the location of the zeros and the local extrema of these functions over exactly one period. Before we begin our next example, we need to review the concept of the 'argument' of a function as first introduced in Section 1.4. For the function \\(f(x)=1-5\\cos(2x-\\pi)\\), the argument of \\(f\\) is \\(x\\). We shall have occasion, however, to refer to the argument of the _cosine_, which in this case is \\(2x-\\pi\\). Loosely stated, the argument of a trigonometric function is the expression 'inside' the function.\n**Example 10.5.1**.: Graph one cycle of the following functions. State the period of each.\n1. \\(f(x)=3\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}\\right)+1\\) \\(g(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\pi-2x)+\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. We set the argument of the cosine, \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}\\), equal to each of the values: \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), \\(2\\pi\\) and solve for \\(x\\). We summarize the results below. \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline \\(a\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}=a\\) & \\(x\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(0\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}=0\\) & \\(1\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) & \\(2\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\pi\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}=\\pi\\) & \\(3\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) & \\(4\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(2\\pi\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}=2\\pi\\) & \\(5\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Next, we substitute each of these \\(x\\) values into \\(f(x)=3\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x-\\pi}{2}\\right)+1\\) to determine the corresponding \\(y\\)-values and connect the dots in a pleasing wavelike fashion.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\(f(x)\\) & \\((x,f(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(1\\) & \\(4\\) & \\((1,4)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(2\\) & \\(1\\) & \\((2,1)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(3\\) & \\(-2\\) & \\((3,-2)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(4\\) & \\(1\\) & \\((4,1)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(5\\) & \\(4\\) & \\((5,4)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} One cycle is graphed on \\([1,5]\\) so the period is the length of that interval which is \\(4\\).\n2. Proceeding as above, we set the argument of the sine, \\(\\pi-2x\\), equal to each of our quarter marks and solve for \\(x\\).\nWe now find the corresponding \\(y\\)-values on the graph by substituting each of these \\(x\\)-values into \\(g(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\pi-2x)+\\frac{3}{2}\\). Once again, we connect the dots in a wavelike fashion.\nOne cycle was graphed on the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) so the period is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\pi\\).\nThe functions in Example 10.5.1 are examples of **sinusoids**. Roughly speaking, a sinusoid is the result of taking the basic graph of \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) or \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\) and performing any of the transformations6 mentioned in Section 1.7. Sinusoids can be characterized by four properties: period, amplitude, phase shift and vertical shift. We have already discussed period, that is, how long it takes for the sinusoid to complete one cycle. The standard period of both \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) and \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\) is \\(2\\pi\\), but horizontal scalings will change the period of the resulting sinusoid. The **amplitude** of the sinusoid is a measure of how 'tall' the wave is, as indicated in the figure below. The amplitude of the standard cosine and sine functions is \\(1\\), but vertical scalings can alter this.\nFootnote 6: We have already seen how the Even/Odd and Cofunction Identities can be used to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\) as a transformed version of \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\), so of course, the reverse is true: \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) can be written as a transformed version of \\(g(x)=\\sin(x)\\). The authors have seen some instances where sinusoids are always converted to cosine functions while in other disciplines, the sinusoids are always written in terms of sine functions. We will discuss the applications of sinusoids in greater detail in Chapter 11. Until then, we will keep our options open.\n### 10.5 Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions\n\n\n",

Apart from a very specialized family of functions which are both even and odd,3 functions fall into one of three distinct categories: even, odd, or neither even nor odd.\nFootnote 3: Any ideas?\n**Example 1.6.3**.: Determine analytically if the following functions are even, odd, or neither even nor odd. Verify your result with a graphing calculator.\n1. \\(f(x)=\\frac{5}{2-x^{2}}\\) 2. \\(g(x)=\\frac{5x}{2-x^{2}}\\)\n3. \\(h(x)=\\frac{5x}{2-x^{3}}\\) 4. \\(i(x)=\\frac{5x}{2x-x^{3}}\\)\n5. \\(j(x)=x^{2}-\\frac{x}{100}-1\\) 6. \\(p(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}x+3&\\mbox{if}\\quad x<0\\\\ -x+3,&\\mbox{if}\\quad x\\geq 0\\end{array}\\right.\\)\n**Solution.** The first step in all of these problems is to replace \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\) and simplify.\n1. \\[f(x) = \\frac{5}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[f(-x) = \\frac{5}{2-(-x)^{2}}\\] \\[f(-x) = \\frac{5}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[f(-x) = f(x)\\] Hence, \\(f\\) is **even**. The graphing calculator furnishes the following.\nThis suggests4 that the graph of \\(f\\) is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis, as expected.\nFootnote 4: ‘Suggests’ is about the extent of what it can do.\n2. \\[g(x) = \\frac{5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[g(-x) = \\frac{5(-x)}{2-(-x)^{2}}\\] \\[g(-x) = \\frac{-5x}{2-x^{2}}\\]\nIt doesn't appear that \\(g(-x)\\) is equivalent to \\(g(x)\\). To prove this, we check with an \\(x\\) value. After some trial and error, we see that \\(g(1)=5\\) whereas \\(g(-1)=-5\\). This proves that \\(g\\) is not even, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that \\(g\\) is odd. (Why not?) To check if \\(g\\) is odd, we compare \\(g(-x)\\) with \\(-g(x)\\)\n\\[-g(x) = -\\frac{5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[= \\frac{-5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[-g(x) = g(-x)\\]\nHence, \\(g\\) is odd. Graphically,\nThe calculator indicates the graph of \\(g\\) is symmetric about the origin, as expected.\n3. \\[h(x) = \\frac{5x}{2-x^{3}}\\] \\[h(-x) = \\frac{5(-x)}{2-(-x)^{3}}\\] \\[h(-x) = \\frac{-5x}{2+x^{3}}\\] Once again, \\(h(-x)\\) doesn't appear to be equivalent to \\(h(x)\\). We check with an \\(x\\) value, for example, \\(h(1)=5\\) but \\(h(-1)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\). This proves that \\(h\\) is not even and it also shows \\(h\\) is not odd. (Why?) Graphically,\nThe graph of \\(h\\) appears to be neither symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis nor the origin.\n4. \\[i(x) = \\frac{5x}{2x-x^{3}}\\] \\[i(-x) = \\frac{5(-x)}{2(-x)-(-x)^{3}}\\] \\[i(-x) = \\frac{-5x}{-2x+x^{3}}\\]\nThe expression \\(i(-x)\\) doesn't appear to be equivalent to \\(i(x)\\). However, after checking some \\(x\\) values, for example \\(x=1\\) yields \\(i(1)=5\\) and \\(i(-1)=5\\), it appears that \\(i(-x)\\) does, in fact, equal \\(i(x)\\). However, while this suggests \\(i\\) is even, it doesn't prove it. (It does, however, prove\n\\(i\\) is not odd.) To prove \\(i(-x)=i(x)\\), we need to manipulate our expressions for \\(i(x)\\) and \\(i(-x)\\) and show that they are equivalent. A clue as to how to proceed is in the numerators: in the formula for \\(i(x)\\), the numerator is \\(5x\\) and in \\(i(-x)\\) the numerator is \\(-5x\\). To re-write \\(i(x)\\) with a numerator of \\(-5x\\), we need to multiply its numerator by \\(-1\\). To keep the value of the fraction the same, we need to multiply the denominator by \\(-1\\) as well. Thus \\[i(x) = \\frac{5x}{2x-x^{3}}\\] \\[= \\frac{(-1)5x}{(-1)\\left(2x-x^{3}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{-5x}{-2x+x^{3}}\\] Hence, \\(i(x)=i(-x)\\), so \\(i\\) is even. The calculator supports our conclusion.\nThe expression \\(-j(x)\\) doesn't seem to match \\(j(-x)\\) either. Testing \\(x=2\\) gives \\(j(2)=\\frac{149}{50}\\) and \\(j(-2)=\\frac{151}{50}\\), so \\(j\\) is not odd, either. The calculator gives:\nThe calculator suggests that the graph of \\(j\\) is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis which would imply that \\(j\\) is even. However, we have proven that is not the case.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Graphical Interpretation of Equations and Inequalities**\nSuppose \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are functions.\n* The solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) are the \\(x\\) values where the graphs of \\(y=f(x)\\) and \\(y=g(x)\\) intersect.\n* The solution to \\(f(x)<g(x)\\) is the set of \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) is _below_ the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\).\n* The solution to \\(f(x)>g(x)\\) is the set of \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\)_above_ the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\).\nThe next example turns the tables and furnishes the graphs of two functions and asks for solutions to equations and inequalities.\n**Example 2.4.2**.: The graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are below. (The graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) is bolded.) Use these graphs to answer the following questions.\n1. Solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\). 2. Solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\). 3. Solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. To solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\), we look for where the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) intersect. These appear to be at the points \\((-1,2)\\) and \\((1,2)\\), so our solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\).\n2. To solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen for the \\(x\\) values less than \\(-1\\) and greater than \\(1\\). Our solution is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n3. To solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\), we look for solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) as well as \\(f(x)>g(x)\\). We solved the former equation and found \\(x=\\pm 1\\). To solve \\(f(x)>g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is above the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\), on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Hence, our solution to \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\).\nWe now turn our attention to solving inequalities involving the absolute value. We have the following theorem from Intermediate Algebra to help us.\n**Theorem 2.4. Inequalities Involving the Absolute Value:** Let \\(c\\) be a real number.\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\).\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c\\leq x\\leq c\\).\n* For \\(c\\leq 0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) has no solution, and for \\(c<0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) has no solution.\n* For \\(c\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|>c\\) is equivalent to \\(x<-c\\) or \\(x>c\\).\n* For \\(c\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|\\geq c\\) is equivalent to \\(x\\leq-c\\) or \\(x\\geq c\\).\n* For \\(c<0\\), \\(|x|>c\\) and \\(|x|\\geq c\\) are true for all real numbers.\nAs with Theorem 2.1 in Section 2.2, we could argue Theorem 2.4 using cases. However, in light of what we have developed in this section, we can understand these statements graphically. For instance, if \\(c>0\\), the graph of \\(y=c\\) is a horizontal line which lies above the \\(x\\)-axis through \\((0,c)\\). To solve \\(|x|<c\\), we are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) is below the graph of \\(y=c\\). We know that the graphs intersect when \\(|x|=c\\), which, from Section 2.2, we know happens when \\(x=c\\) or \\(x=-c\\). Graphing, we get\nWe see that the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) is below \\(y=c\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(-c\\) and \\(c\\), and hence we get \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\). The other properties in Theorem 2.4 can be shown similarly.\n**Example 2.4.3.** Solve the following inequalities analytically; check your answers graphically.\n\n\n",

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it). Using the root test:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 11.4 Alternating Series\nNext we consider series with both positive and negative terms, but in a regular pattern: they alternate, as in the **alternating harmonic series** for example:\n\\[\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{-1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+ \\frac{-1}{4}+\\cdots=\\frac{1}{1}-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{4}+\\cdots.\\]\nIn this series the sizes of the terms decrease, that is, \\(|a_{n}|\\) forms a decreasing sequence, but this is not required in an alternating series. As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.\n**THEOREM 11.4.1** Suppose that \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\). Then the alternating series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\) converges.\n_Proof._ The odd numbered partial sums, \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a non-increasing sequence, because \\(s_{2k+3}=s_{2k+1}-a_{2k+2}+a_{2k+3}\\leq s_{2k+1}\\), since \\(a_{2k+2}\\geq a_{2k+3}\\). This\nFigure 11.4.1: The alternating harmonic series.\nsequence is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so it must converge, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=L\\). Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form a non-decreasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k}=M\\). Since \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\) and \\(s_{2k+1}=s_{2k}+a_{2k+1}\\),\n\\[L=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(s_{2k}+a_{2k+1})=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty }s_{2k}+\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}a_{2k+1}=M+0=M,\\]\nso \\(L=M\\), the two sequences of partial sums converge to the same limit, and this means the entire sequence of partial sums also converges to \\(L\\).\nAnother useful fact is implicit in this discussion. Suppose that\n\\[L=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\]\nand that we approximate \\(L\\) by a finite part of this sum, say\n\\[L\\approx\\sum_{n=1}^{N}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}.\\]\nBecause the terms are decreasing in size, we know that the true value of \\(L\\) must be between this approximation and the next one, that is, between\n\\[\\sum_{n=1}^{N}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad\\sum_{n=1}^{N+1}(-1)^{n-1}a_ {n}.\\]\nDepending on whether \\(N\\) is odd or even, the second will be larger or smaller than the first.\nApproximate the alternating harmonic series to one decimal place.\nWe need to go roughly to the point at which the next term to be added or subtracted is \\(1/10\\). Adding up the first nine and the first ten terms we get approximately \\(0.746\\) and \\(0.646\\). These are \\(1/10\\) apart, but it is not clear how the correct value would be rounded. It turns out that we are able to settle the question by computing the sums of the first eleven and twelve terms, which give \\(0.737\\) and \\(0.653\\), so correct to one place the value is \\(0.7\\).\n\n\n",

Here we explore another such application.\nRecall that the tangent line to \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x=a\\) is given by \\(L(x)=f^{\\prime}(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\). The tangent line in this context is also called the **linear approximation** to \\(f\\) at \\(a\\).\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line.

The minimum value of \\(f\\) is the smallest \\(y\\)-coordinate which is \\(-3\\).\nWith few exceptions, we will not develop techniques in College Algebra which allow us to determine the intervals on which a function is increasing, decreasing or constant or to find the local maximums and local minimums analytically; this is the business of Calculus.15 When we have need to find such beasts, we will resort to the calculator. Most graphing calculators have 'Minimum' and 'Maximum' features which can be used to approximate these values, as we now demonstrate.\nFootnote 15: Although, truth be told, there is only one step of Calculus involved, followed by several pages of algebra.\n**Example 1.6.5**.: Let \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{15x}{x^{2}+3}\\). Use a graphing calculator to approximate the intervals on which \\(f\\) is increasing and those on which it is decreasing. Approximate all extrema.\n**Solution.** Entering this function into the calculator gives\nUsing the Minimum and Maximum features, we get\nTo two decimal places, \\(f\\) appears to have its only local minimum at \\((-1.73,-4.33)\\) and its only local maximum at \\((1.73,4.33)\\). Given the symmetry about the origin suggested by the graph, the relation between these points shouldn't be too surprising. The function appears to be increasing on \\([-1.73,1.73]\\) and decreasing on \\((-\\infty,-1.73]\\cup[1.73,\\infty)\\). This makes \\(-4.33\\) the (absolute) minimum and \\(4.33\\) the (absolute) maximum.\n**Example 1.6.6**.: Find the points on the graph of \\(y=(x-3)^{2}\\) which are closest to the origin. Round your answers to two decimal places.\n**Solution.** Suppose a point \\((x,y)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=(x-3)^{2}\\). Its distance to the origin \\((0,0)\\) is given by\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x-0)^{2}+(y-0)^{2}}\\] \\[= \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\] \\[= \\sqrt{x^{2}+[(x-3)^{2}]^{2}}\\hskip 28.452756pt\\text{Since }y=(x-3)^{2}\\] \\[= \\sqrt{x^{2}+(x-3)^{4}}\\]\nGiven a value for \\(x\\), the formula \\(d=\\sqrt{x^{2}+(x-3)^{4}}\\) is the distance from \\((0,0)\\) to the point \\((x,y)\\) on the curve \\(y=(x-3)^{2}\\). What we have defined, then, is a function \\(d(x)\\) which we wish to\nminimize over all values of \\(x\\). To accomplish this task analytically would require Calculus so as we've mentioned before, we can use a graphing calculator to find an approximate solution. Using the calculator, we enter the function \\(d(x)\\) as shown below and graph.\nUsing the Minimum feature, we see above on the right that the (absolute) minimum occurs near \\(x=2\\). Rounding to two decimal places, we get that the minimum distance occurs when \\(x=2.00\\). To find the \\(y\\) value on the parabola associated with \\(x=2.00\\), we substitute \\(2.00\\) into the equation to get \\(y=(x-3)^{2}=(2.00-3)^{2}=1.00\\). So, our final answer is \\((2.00,1.00)\\).16 (What does the \\(y\\) value listed on the calculator screen mean in this problem?) \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 12, sketch the graph of the given function.

The second derivative \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|\\) incorporates this notion of time, so it depends not simply on the geometric properties of the curve but on how quickly we move along the curve.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.5** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf s}(t)=\\langle\\cos 2t,\\sin 2t,0\\rangle\\). Both of these vector functions represent the unit circle in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, but if \\(t\\) is interpreted as time, the second describes an object moving twice as fast as the first. Computing the second derivatives, we find \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=1\\), \\(|{\\bf s}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=4\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nTo remove the dependence on time, we use the arc length parameterization. If a curve is given by \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), then the first derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit vector, that is, \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}(s)\\). We now compute the second derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)\\) and use \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)|\\) as the \"official\" measure of **curvature**, usually denoted \\(\\kappa\\).\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.6** We have seen that the arc length parameterization of a particular helix is \\({\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2}),\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2}),s/\\sqrt{2}\\rangle\\). Computing the second derivative gives \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)=\\langle-\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,-\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,0\\rangle\\) with length \\(1/2\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nWhat if we are given a curve as a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is not arc length? We have seen that arc length can be difficult to compute; fortunately, we do not need to convert to the arc length parameterization to compute curvature. Instead, let us imagine that we have done this, so we have found \\(t=g(s)\\) and then formed \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)={\\bf r}(g(s))\\). The first derivative \\(\\hat{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit tangent vector, so it is the same as the unit tangent vector \\({\\bf T}(t)={\\bf T}(g(s))\\). Taking the derivative of this we get\n\\[{d\\over ds}{\\bf T}(g(s))={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(g(s))g^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime} (t){dt\\over ds}.\\]\nThe curvature is the length of this vector:\n\\[\\kappa=|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)||{dt\\over ds}|={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|ds/dt|} ={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}.\\]\n(Recall that we have seen that \\(ds/dt=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\).) Thus we can compute the curvature by computing only derivatives with respect to \\(t\\); we do not need to do the conversion to arc length.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.7** Returning to the helix, suppose we start with the parameterization \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{2}\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}\\). Then \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\cos t,-\\sin t,0\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1/\\sqrt{2}\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=1/2\\), as before.\n### 13.3 Arc length and curvature\n**Example 13.3.8** Consider this circle of radius \\(a\\): \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle a\\cos t,a\\sin t,1\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=a\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle/a\\). Now \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\cos t,-a\\sin t,0\\rangle/a\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/a\\): the curvature of a circle is everywhere the reciprocal of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous example is \\(1/2\\); this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius \\(2\\), as shown in figure 13.3.1.\n**Figure 13.3.1** A circle with the same curvature as the helix. (AP)\n**Example 13.3.9** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,\\cos 2t\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 13.2.4. \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,-2\\sin(2t)\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}\\), so\n\\[{\\bf T}(t)=\\left\\langle\\frac{-\\sin t}{\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}},\\frac{\\cos t}{ \\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}},\\frac{-2\\sin 2t}{\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}}\\right\\rangle.\\]\nComputing the derivative of this and then the length of the resulting vector is possible but unpleasant.\n\n\n",

We begin solving \\(2\\sin(x)\\leq 1\\) by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and zero on the other to get \\(2\\sin(x)-1\\leq 0\\). Next, we let \\(f(x)=2\\sin(x)-1\\) and note that our original inequality is equivalent to solving \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\). We now look to see where, if ever, \\(f\\) is undefined and where \\(f(x)=0\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, we can immediately set about finding the zeros of \\(f\\). Solving \\(f(x)=0\\), we have \\(2\\sin(x)-1=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). The solutions here are \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since we are restricting our attention to \\([0,2\\pi)\\), only \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) are of concern to us.

For \\(x=0\\) we have \\(f(0)=-1\\), for \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) and for \\(x=\\pi\\) we get \\(f(\\pi)=-1\\).

For \\(x=0\\) we find \\(f(0)=-1\\); when \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\); for \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)=-1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-2}{2}\\); when \\(x=\\pi\\) we have \\(f(\\pi)=1\\), and lastly, for \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)=-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{-2-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). We see \\(f(x)>0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), so this is our answer. We can use the calculator to check that the graph of \\(y=\\sin(2x)\\) is indeed above the graph of \\(y=\\cos(x)\\) on those intervals. 3. Proceeding as in the last two problems, we rewrite \\(\\tan(x)\\geq 3\\) as \\(\\tan(x)-3\\geq 0\\) and let \\(f(x)=\\tan(x)-3\\). We note that on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), \\(f\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), so those values will need the usual disclaimer on the sign diagram.11 Moving along to zeros, solving \\(f(x)=\\tan(x)-3=0\\) requires the arctangent function. We find \\(x=\\arctan(3)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\) and of these, only \\(x=\\arctan(3)\\) and \\(x=\\arctan(3)+\\pi\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Since \\(3>0\\), we know \\(0<\\arctan(3)<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) which allows us to position these zeros correctly on the sign diagram. To choose test values, we begin with \\(x=0\\) and find \\(f(0)=-3\\). Finding a convenient test value in the interval \\(\\left(\\arctan(3),\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) is a bit more challenging. Keep in mind that the arctangent function is increasing and is bounded above by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). This means that the number \\(x=\\arctan(117)\\) is guaranteed12 to lie between \\(\\arctan(3)\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). We see that \\(f(\\arctan(117))=\\tan(\\arctan(117))-3=114\\). For our next test value, we take \\(x=\\pi\\) and find \\(f(\\pi)=-3\\). To find our next test value, we note that since \\(\\arctan(3)<\\arctan(117)<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), it follows13 that \\(\\arctan(3)+\\pi<\\arctan(117)+\\pi<\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Evaluating \\(f\\) at \\(x=\\arctan(117)+\\pi\\) yields \\(f(\\arctan(117)+\\pi)=\\tan(\\arctan(117)+\\pi)-3=\\tan(\\arctan(117))-3=114\\). We choose our last test value to be \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) and find \\(f\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)=-4\\). Since we want \\(f(x)\\geq 0\\), we see that our answer is \\(\\left[\\arctan(3),\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cup\\left[\\arctan(3)+\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Using the graphs of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) and \\(y=3\\), we see when the graph of the former is above (or meets) the graph of the latter. [FOOTNOTE:13]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFirst we must translate this into a purely mathematical problem in which we want to find the minimum value of a function. If \\(x\\) denotes one of the sides of the rectangle, then the adjacent side must be \\(100/x\\) (in order that the area be \\(100\\)). So the function we want\nFigure 2.2: \\(f(x)=x^{3}-x\\)\nto minimize is\n\\[f(x)=2x+2\\frac{100}{x}\\]\nsince the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width of the rectangle. Not all values of \\(x\\) make sense in this problem: lengths of sides of rectangles must be positive, so \\(x>0\\). If \\(x>0\\) then so is \\(100/x\\), so we need no second condition on \\(x\\).\nWe next find \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and set it equal to zero: \\(0=f^{\\prime}(x)=2-200/x^{2}\\). Solving \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=0\\) for \\(x\\) gives us \\(x=\\pm 10\\). We are interested only in \\(x>0\\), so only the value \\(x=10\\) is of interest. Since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is defined everywhere on the interval \\((0,\\infty)\\), there are no more critical values, and there are no endpoints. Is there a local maximum, minimum, or neither at \\(x=10\\)? The second derivative is \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=400/x^{3}\\), and \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(10)>0\\), so there is a local minimum. Since there is only one critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the rectangle with smallest perimeter is the \\(10\\times 10\\) square. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 6.1.8**: You want to sell a certain number \\(n\\) of items in order to maximize your profit. Market research tells you that if you set the price at $1.50, you will be able to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you lower the price below $1.50 you will be able to sell another 1000 items. Suppose that your fixed costs (\"start-up costs\") total $2000, and the per item cost of production (\"marginal cost\") is $0.50. Find the price to set per item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also determine the maximum profit you can get.\nThe first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization problem. Since we want to maximize profit by setting the price per item, we should look for a function \\(P(x)\\) representing the profit when the price per item is \\(x\\). Profit is revenue minus costs, and revenue is number of items sold times the price per item, so we get \\(P=nx-2000-0.50n\\). The number of items sold is itself a function of \\(x\\), \\(n=5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10\\), because \\((1.5-x)/0.10\\) is the number of multiples of 10 cents that the price is below $1.50. Now we substitute for \\(n\\) in the profit function:\n\\[P(x) =(5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10)x-2000-0.5(5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10)\\] \\[=-10000x^{2}+25000x-12000\\]\nWe want to know the maximum value of this function when \\(x\\) is between 0 and 1.5. The derivative is \\(P^{\\prime}(x)=-20000x+25000\\), which is zero when \\(x=1.25\\). Since \\(P^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=-20000<0\\), there must be a local maximum at \\(x=1.25\\), and since this is the only critical value it must be a global maximum as well. (Alternately, we could compute \\(P(0)=-12000\\), \\(P(1.25)=3625\\), and \\(P(1.5)=3000\\) and note that \\(P(1.25)\\) is the maximum of these.) Thus the maximum profit is $3625, attained when we set the price at $1.25 and sell 7500 items.\n\n\n",

Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n3. Since \\(\\cot(3x)=0\\) has the form \\(\\cot(u)=0\\), we know \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\), so, in this case, \\(3x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) yields \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}k\\). Checking our answers, we get \\[\\cot\\left(3\\left[\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}+\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}k\\right]\\right) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of cotangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= 0\\] As \\(k\\) runs through the integers, we obtain six answers, corresponding to \\(k=0\\) through \\(k=5\\), which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\,\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\,\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\) , \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\). To confirm these graphically, we must be careful. On many calculators, there is no function button for cotangent. We choose4 to use the quotient identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis), we see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points approximately match our solutions. Footnote 4: The reader is encouraged to see what happens if we had chosen the reciprocal identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{1}{\\tan(3x)}\\) instead. The graph on the calculator _appears_ identical, but what happens when you try to find the intersection points?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. We resist the temptation to divide both sides of \\(3\\sin^{3}(x)=\\sin^{2}(x)\\) by \\(\\sin^{2}(x)\\) (What goes wrong if you do?) and instead gather all of the terms to one side of the equation and factor. \\[3\\sin^{3}(x) = \\sin^{2}(x)\\] \\[3\\sin^{3}(x)-\\sin^{2}(x) = 0\\] \\[\\sin^{2}(x)(3\\sin(x)-1) = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Factor out $\\sin^{2}(x)$ from both terms}.\\] We get \\(\\sin^{2}(x)=0\\) or \\(3\\sin(x)-1=0\\). Solving for \\(\\sin(x)\\), we find \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\). The solution to the first equation is \\(x=\\pi k\\), with \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) being the two solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To solve \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we use the arcsine function to get \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We find the two solutions here which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) to be \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\). To check graphically, we plot \\(y=3(\\sin(x))^{3}\\) and \\(y=(\\sin(x))^{2}\\) and find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of these two curves. Some extra zooming is required near \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) to verify that these two curves do in fact intersect four times.6 Footnote 6: Note that we are _not_ counting the point \\((2\\pi,0)\\) in our solution set since \\(x=2\\pi\\) is not in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\). In the forthcoming solutions, remember that while \\(x=2\\pi\\) may be a solution to the equation, it isn’t counted among the solutions in \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n2. Analysis of \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=\\tan(x)+3\\) reveals two different trigonometric functions, so an identity is in order. Since \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)\\), we get \\[\\sec^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\] \\[1+\\tan^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\quad\\text{(Since $\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)$.)}\\] \\[\\tan^{2}(x)-\\tan(x)-2 = 0\\] \\[u^{2}-u-2 = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Let $u=\\tan(x)$.}\\] \\[(u+1)(u-2) = 0\\]\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n4. To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\nTo solve \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\), we need the techniques in Chapter 3 to factor \\(4u^{3}-2u-2\\) into \\((u-1)\\left(4u^{2}+4u+2\\right)\\). We get either \\(u-1=0\\) or \\(4u^{2}+2u+2=0\\), and since the discriminant of the latter is negative, the only real solution to \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\) is \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), so \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The only solution which lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) is \\(x=0\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y=2-\\cos(x)\\) on the same set of axes over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) shows that the graphs intersect at what appears to be \\((0,1)\\), as required. \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=3\\cos(x)-2}\\) \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=2-\\cos(x)}\\)\n\n\n",

For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\).

When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem.

This matches the domain we get from the formula \\(g^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x}{x+2}\\), as it should.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* of the polynomial \\(f\\).\n* The term \\(a_{n}x^{n}\\) is called the **leading term*\n* of the polynomial \\(f\\).\n* The real number \\(a_{n}\\) is called the **leading coefficient*\n* of the polynomial \\(f\\).\n* The real number \\(a_{0}\\) is called the **constant term*\n* of the polynomial \\(f\\).\n* If \\(f(x)=a_{0}\\), and \\(a_{0}\\neq 0\\), we say \\(f\\) has degree \\(0\\).\n* If \\(f(x)=0\\), we say \\(f\\) has no degree.3 Footnote 3: The reader may well wonder why we have chosen to separate off constant functions from the other polynomials in Definition 3.2. Why not just lump them all together and, instead of forcing \\(n\\) to be a natural number, \\(n=1,2,\\ldots\\), allow \\(n\\) to be a whole number, \\(n=0,1,2,\\ldots\\). We could unify all\nof the cases, since, after all, isn't \\(a_{0}x^{0}=a_{0}\\)? The answer is 'yes, as long as \\(x\\neq 0\\).' The function \\(f(x)=3\\) and \\(g(x)=3x^{0}\\) are different, because their domains are different. The number \\(f(0)=3\\) is defined, whereas \\(g(0)=3(0)^{0}\\) is not.3 Indeed, much of the theory we will develop in this chapter doesn't include the constant functions, so we might as well treat them as outsiders from the start. One good thing that comes from Definition 3.2 is that we can now think of linear functions as degree 1 (or 'first degree') polynomial functions and quadratic functions as degree 2 (or 'second degree') polynomial functions.\nFootnote 3: Technically, \\(0^{0}\\) is an indeterminant form, which is a special case of being undefined. The authors realize this is beyond pedantry, but we wouldn’t mention it if we didn’t feel it was neccessary.\n**Example 3.1.2**.: Find the degree, leading term, leading coefficient and constant term of the following polynomial functions.\n1. \\(f(x)=4x^{5}-3x^{2}+2x-5\\) 2. \\(g(x)=12x+x^{3}\\)\n2. \\(h(x)=\\frac{4-x}{5}\\) 4. \\(p(x)=(2x-1)^{3}(x-2)(3x+2)\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. There are no surprises with \\(f(x)=4x^{5}-3x^{2}+2x-5\\). It is written in the form of Definition 3.2, and we see that the degree is 5, the leading term is \\(4x^{5}\\), the leading coefficient is 4 and the constant term is \\(-5\\).\n2. The form given in Definition 3.2 has the highest power of \\(x\\) first. To that end, we re-write \\(g(x)=12x+x^{3}=x^{3}+12x\\), and see that the degree of \\(g\\) is 3, the leading term is \\(x^{3}\\), the leading coefficient is 1 and the constant term is 0.\n3. We need to rewrite the formula for \\(h\\) so that it resembles the form given in Definition 3.2: \\(h(x)=\\frac{4-x}{5}=\\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{x}{5}=-\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{4}{5}\\). The degree of \\(h\\) is 1, the leading term is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}x\\), the leading coefficient is \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) and the constant term is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n4. It may seem that we have some work ahead of us to get \\(p\\) in the form of Definition 3.2. However, it is possible to glean the information requested about \\(p\\) without multiplying out the entire expression \\((2x-1)^{3}(x-2)(3x+2)\\). The leading term of \\(p\\) will be the term which has the highest power of \\(x\\). The way to get this term is to multiply the terms with the highest power of \\(x\\) from each factor together - in other words, the leading term of \\(p(x)\\) is the product of the leading terms of the factors of \\(p(x)\\). Hence, the leading term of \\(p\\) is \\((2x)^{3}(x)(3x)=24x^{5}\\). This means that the degree of \\(p\\) is 5 and the leading coefficient is 24. As for the constant term, we can perform a similar trick. The constant term is obtained by multiplying the constant terms from each of the factors \\((-1)^{3}(-2)(2)=4\\).\n\n\n",

What is y(2)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 17.6 Second Order Linear Equations\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\\[\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=2a-(2at+b)-6(at^{2}+bt+c)=-6at^{2}+(-2a-6b)t+(2a-b-6c).\\]\nWe want this to equal \\(18t^{2}+5\\), so we need\n\\[\\eqalign{-6a&=18\\cr-2a-6b&=0\\cr 2a-b-6c&=5\\cr}\\]\nThis is a system of three equations in three unknowns and is not hard to solve: \\(a=-3\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=-2\\). Thus the general solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}-3t^{2}+t-2\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSo the \"judicious guess\" is a function with the same form as \\(f(t)\\) but with undetermined (or better, yet to be determined) coefficients. This works whenever \\(f(t)\\) is a polynomial.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.2** Consider the initial value problem \\(m\\ddot{y}+ky=-mg\\), \\(y(0)=2\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=50\\). The left hand side represents a mass-spring system with no damping, i.e., \\(b=0\\). Unlike the homogeneous case, we now consider the force due to gravity, \\(-mg\\), assuming the spring is vertical at the surface of the earth, so that \\(g=980\\). To be specific, let us take \\(m=1\\) and \\(k=100\\). The general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)\\). For the solution to the non-homogeneous equation we guess simply a constant \\(y=a\\), since \\(-mg=-980\\) is a constant. Then \\(\\ddot{y}+100y=100a\\) so \\(a=-980/100=-9.8\\). The desired general solution is then \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). Substituting the initial conditions we get\n\\[\\eqalign{2&=A-9.8\\cr 50&=10B\\cr}\\]\nso \\(A=11.8\\) and \\(B=5\\) and the solution is \\(11.8\\cos(10t)+5\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nMore generally, this method can be used when a function similar to \\(f(t)\\) has derivatives that are also similar to \\(f(t)\\); in the examples so far, since \\(f(t)\\) was a polynomial, so were its derivatives. The method will work if \\(f(t)\\) has the form \\(p(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)+q(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)\\), where \\(p(t)\\) and \\(q(t)\\) are polynomials; when \\(\\alpha=\\beta=0\\) this is simply \\(p(t)\\), a polynomial. In the most general form it is not simple to describe the appropriate judicious guess; we content ourselves with some examples to illustrate the process.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+36y=6e^{-6t}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-8\\dot{y}+16y=-2e^{4t}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+6\\dot{y}+5y=4\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-12y=t\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+5y=8\\sin(2t)\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-4y=4e^{2t}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Solve the initial value problem.\n* \\(\\ddot{y}-y=3t+5\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+9y=4t\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+37y=10e^{-4t}\\), \\(y(0)=4\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* \\(\\ddot{y}+6\\dot{y}+18y=\\cos t-\\sin t\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(\\ddot{y}+4\\dot{y}+29y=689\\cos(2t)\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\).

This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\nThe first two terms in parentheses are zero because \\(y_{1}\\) and \\(y_{2}\\) are solutions to the associated homogeneous equation. Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find.

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n4. In finding the domain of \\(F\\), we notice that we have two potentially hazardous issues: not only do we have a denominator, we have a fourth (even-indexed) root. Our strategy is to determine the restrictions imposed by each part and select the real numbers which satisfy both conditions. To satisfy the fourth root, we require \\(2x+1\\geq 0\\). From this we get \\(2x\\geq-1\\) or \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Next, we round up the values of \\(x\\) which could cause trouble in the denominator by setting the denominator equal to \\(0\\). We get \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), or \\(x=\\pm 1\\). Hence, in order for a real number \\(x\\) to be in the domain of \\(F\\), \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but \\(x\\neq\\pm 1\\). In interval notation, this set is \\(\\left[-\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n5. Don't be put off by the '\\(t\\)' here. It is an independent variable representing a real number, just like \\(x\\) does, and is subject to the same restrictions. As in the previous problem, we have double danger here: we have a square root and a denominator. To satisfy the square root, we need a non-negative radicand so we set \\(t+3\\geq 0\\) to get \\(t\\geq-3\\). Setting the denominator equal to zero gives \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=0\\), or \\(\\sqrt{t+3}=6\\). Squaring both sides gives \\(t+3=36\\), or \\(t=33\\). Since we squared both sides in the course of solving this equation, we need to check our answer.5 Sure enough, when \\(t=33\\), \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=6-\\sqrt{36}=0\\), so \\(t=33\\) will cause problems in the denominator. At last we can find the domain of \\(r\\): we need \\(t\\geq-3\\), but \\(t\\neq 33\\). Our final answer is \\([-3,33)\\cup(33,\\infty)\\). Footnote 5: Do you remember why? Consider squaring both sides to ‘solve’ \\(\\sqrt{t+1}=-2\\).\n6. It's tempting to simplify \\(I(x)=\\frac{3x^{2}}{x}=3x\\), and, since there are no longer any denominators, claim that there are no longer any restrictions. However, in simplifying \\(I(x)\\), we are assuming \\(x\\neq 0\\), since \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) is undefined.6 Proceeding as before, we find the domain of \\(I\\) to be all real numbers except \\(0\\): \\((-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 4.1.1**.: Find the domain of the following rational functions. Write them in the form \\(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) for polynomial functions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and simplify.\n1. \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\) \\(g(x)=2-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\)\n2. \\(h(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}-\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\) \\(r(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}\\) \\(\\div\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. To find the domain of \\(f\\), we proceed as we did in Section 1.4: we find the zeros of the denominator and exclude them from the domain. Setting \\(x+1=0\\) results in \\(x=-1\\). Hence,\nour domain is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,\\infty)\\). The expression \\(f(x)\\) is already in the form requested and when we check for common factors among the numerator and denominator we find none, so we are done.\n2. Proceeding as before, we determine the domain of \\(g\\) by solving \\(x+1=0\\). As before, we find the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,\\infty)\\). To write \\(g(x)\\) in the form requested, we need to get a common denominator \\[g(x) = 2-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\qquad=\\ \\ \\frac{2}{1}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2)(x+1)}{(1)(x+1)}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x+2)-3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\] This formula is now completely simplified.\n3. The denominators in the formula for \\(h(x)\\) are both \\(x^{2}-1\\) whose zeros are \\(x=\\pm 1\\). As a result, the domain of \\(h\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\). We now proceed to simplify \\(h(x)\\). Since we have the same denominator in both terms, we subtract the numerators. We then factor the resulting numerator and denominator, and cancel out the common factor. \\[h(x) = \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}-\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{\\left(2x^{2}-1\\right)-(3x-2)}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-1-3x+2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-3x+1}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\ \\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\]\n4. To find the domain of \\(r\\), it may help to temporarily rewrite \\(r(x)\\) as \\[r(x)=\\frac{\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}}{\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}}\\] We need to set all of the denominators equal to zero which means we need to solve not only \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), but also \\(\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}=0\\). We find \\(x=\\pm 1\\) for the former and \\(x=\\frac{2}{3}\\) for the latter. Our domain is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup\\left(-1,\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{2}{3},1\\right)\\cup (1,\\infty)\\). We simplify \\(r(x)\\) by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and then by canceling the common factor\n\\[r(x) = \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}\\div\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\quad= \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}\\cdot\\frac{x^{2}-1}{3x-2}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{\\left(2x^{2}-1\\right)\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)\\left(3x -2\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{\\left(2x^{2}-1\\right)\\left(x^{2}-1\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}-1 \\right)\\left(3x-2\\right)}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{3x-2}\\]\nA few remarks about Example 4.1.1 are in order. Note that the expressions for \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) work out to be the same. However, only two of these functions are actually equal. Recall that functions are ultimately sets of ordered pairs,1 so for two functions to be equal, they need, among other things, to have the same domain. Since \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) and \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) have the same domain, they are equal functions. Even though the formula \\(h(x)\\) is the same as \\(f(x)\\), the domain of \\(h\\) is different than the domain of \\(f\\), and thus they are different functions.\nFootnote 1: You should review Sections 1.2 and 1.3 if this statement caught you off guard.\nWe now turn our attention to the graphs of rational functions. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\) from Example 4.1.1. Using a graphing calculator, we obtain\n\\begin{tabular}{|r||c|c|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\(f(x)\\) & \\((x,f(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-1.1\\) & \\(32\\) & \\((-1.1,32)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-1.01\\) & \\(302\\) & \\((-1.01,302)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-1.001\\) & \\(3002\\) & \\((-1.001,3002)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-1.0001\\) & \\(30002\\) & \\((-1.001,30002)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n\n",

Not only is this closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Let \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\nFinally we substitute to find \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}+A(1)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{6}+A\\] \\[A=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThe solution is then\n\\[y=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}t^{-3}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nHere is an alternate method for finding a particular solution to the differential equation, using an **integrating factor**. In the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), we note that if we multiply through by a function \\(I(t)\\) to get \\(I(t)\\dot{y}+I(t)p(t)y=I(t)f(t)\\), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product rule:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(I(t)y)=I(t)\\dot{y}+I^{\\prime}(t)y.\\]\nNow if we could choose \\(I(t)\\) so that \\(I^{\\prime}(t)=I(t)p(t)\\), this would be exactly the left hand side of the differential equation. But this is just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution is \\(I(t)=e^{Q(t)}\\), where \\(Q(t)=\\int p\\,dt\\); note that \\(Q(t)=-P(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) appears in the variation of parameters method and \\(P^{\\prime}(t)=-p\\). Now the modified differential equation is\n\\[e^{-P(t)}\\dot{y}+e^{-P(t)}p(t)y =e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-P(t)}y) =e^{-P(t)}f(t).\\]\nIntegrating both sides gives\n\\[e^{-P(t)}y =\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt\\] \\[y =e^{P(t)}\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nMore generally, this method can be used when a function similar to \\(f(t)\\) has derivatives that are also similar to \\(f(t)\\); in the examples so far, since \\(f(t)\\) was a polynomial, so were its derivatives. The method will work if \\(f(t)\\) has the form \\(p(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)+q(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)\\), where \\(p(t)\\) and \\(q(t)\\) are polynomials; when \\(\\alpha=\\beta=0\\) this is simply \\(p(t)\\), a polynomial. In the most general form it is not simple to describe the appropriate judicious guess; we content ourselves with some examples to illustrate the process.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.3** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+7\\dot{y}+10y=e^{3t}\\). The characteristic equation is \\(r^{2}+7r+10=(r+5)(r+2)\\), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is\n\\(Ae^{-5t}+Be^{-2t}\\). For a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation we guess \\(Ce^{3t}\\). Substituting we get\n\\[9Ce^{3t}+21Ce^{3t}+10Ce^{3t}=e^{3t}40C.\\]\nWhen \\(C=1/40\\) this is equal to \\(f(t)=e^{3t}\\), so the solution is \\(Ae^{-5t}+Be^{-2t}+(1/40)e^{3t}\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.4** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+7\\dot{y}+10y=e^{-2t}\\). Following the last example we might guess \\(Ce^{-2t}\\), but since this is a solution to the homogeneous equation it cannot work. Instead we guess \\(Cte^{-2t}\\). Then\n\\[(-2Ce^{-2t}-2Ce^{-2t}+4Cte^{-2t})+7(Ce^{-2t}-2Cte^{-2t})+10Cte^{-2t}=e^{-2t}(-3C).\\]\nThen \\(C=-1/3\\) and the solution is \\(Ae^{-5t}+Be^{-2t}-(1/3)te^{-2t}\\).\nIn general, if \\(f(t)=e^{kt}\\) and \\(k\\) is one of the roots of the characteristic equation, then we guess \\(Cte^{kt}\\) instead of \\(Ce^{kt}\\). If \\(k\\) is the only root of the characteristic equation, then \\(Cte^{kt}\\) will not work, and we must guess \\(Ct^{2}e^{kt}\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.5** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}-6\\dot{y}+9y=e^{3t}\\). The characteristic equation is \\(r^{2}-6r+9=(r-3)^{2}\\), so the general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Bte^{3t}\\). Guessing \\(Ct^{2}e^{3t}\\) for the particular solution, we get\n\\[(9Ct^{2}e^{3t}+6Cte^{3t}+6Cte^{3t}+2Ce^{3t})-6(3Ct^{2}e^{3t}+2Cte^{3t})+9Ct^{2} e^{3t}=e^{3t}2C.\\]\nThe solution is thus \\(Ae^{3t}+Bte^{3t}+(1/2)t^{2}e^{3t}\\).\nIt is common in various physical systems to encounter an \\(f(t)\\) of the form \\(a\\cos(\\omega t)+b\\sin(\\omega t)\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.6** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+6\\dot{y}+25y=\\cos(4t)\\). The roots of the characteristic equation are \\(-3\\pm 4i\\), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\). For a particular solution, we guess \\(C\\cos(4t)+D\\sin(4t)\\). Substituting as usual:\n\\[\\eqalign{(-16C\\cos(4t)&+-16D\\sin(4t))+6(-4C\\sin(4t)+4D\\cos(4t))+25(C\\cos(4t)+ D\\sin(4t))\\cr&=(24D+9C)\\cos(4t)+(-24C+9D)\\sin(4t).\\cr}\\]\nTo make this equal to \\(\\cos(4t)\\) we need\n\\[\\eqalign{24D+9C&=1\\cr 9D-24C&=0\\cr}\\]\nwhich gives \\(C=1/73\\) and \\(D=8/219\\). The full solution is then \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))+(1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\).\n**476**: **Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nThe function \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\) is a damped oscillation as in example 17.5.3, while \\((1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\) is a simple undamped oscillation. As \\(t\\) increases, the sum \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\) approaches zero, so the solution\n\\[e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))+(1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\]\nbecomes more and more like the simple oscillation \\((1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\)--notice that the initial conditions don't matter to this long term behavior. The damped portion is called the **transient** part of the solution, and the simple oscillation is called the **steady state** part of the solution. A physical example is a mass-spring system. If the only force on the mass is due to the spring, then the behavior of the system is a damped oscillation. If in addition an external force is applied to the mass, and if the force varies according to a function of the form \\(a\\cos(\\omega t)+b\\sin(\\omega t)\\), then the long term behavior will be a simple oscillation determined by the steady state part of the general solution; the initial position of the mass will not matter. \\(\\Box\\)\nAs with the exponential form, such a simple guess may not work.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.7**: Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+16y=-\\sin(4t)\\). The roots of the characteristic equation are \\(\\pm 4i\\), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t)\\). Since both \\(\\cos(4t)\\) and \\(\\sin(4t)\\) are solutions to the homogeneous equation, \\(C\\cos(4t)+D\\sin(4t)\\) is also, so it cannot be a solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Instead, we guess \\(Ct\\cos(4t)+Dt\\sin(4t)\\). Then substituting:\n\\[\\eqalign{(-16Ct\\cos(4t)&-16D\\sin(4t)+8D\\cos(4t)-8C\\sin(4t)))+16(Ct\\cos(4t)+Dt \\sin(4t))\\cr&=8D\\cos(4t)-8C\\sin(4t).}\\]\nThus \\(C=1/8\\), \\(D=0\\), and the solution is \\(C\\cos(4t)+D\\sin(4t)+(1/8)t\\cos(4t)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from exercise 13 in section 17.1, \\(\\dot{y}=ky(M-y)\\): \\(y\\) is a population at time \\(t\\), \\(M\\) is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and \\(k\\) measures the reproduction rate of the population.

As it turns out, this is not accurate to even one decimal place. Figure 17.4.1 shows these points connected by line segments (the lower curve) compared to a solution obtained by a much better approximation technique. Note that the shape is approximately correct even though the end points are quite far apart.\n**Figure 17.4.1** Approximating a solution to \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\), \\(y(0)=0\\).\nIf you need to do Euler's method by hand, it is useful to construct a table to keep track of the work, as shown in figure 17.4.2. Each row holds the computation for a single step: the starting point \\((t_{i},y_{i})\\); the stepsize \\(\\Delta t\\); the computed slope \\(\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\); the change in \\(y\\), \\(\\Delta y=\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\Delta t\\); and the new point, \\((t_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(t_{i}+\\Delta t,y_{i}+\\Delta y)\\). The starting point in each row is the newly computed point from the end of the previous row.\nIt is easy to write a short function in Sage to do Euler's method; see this Sage worksheet.\n#### 17 Differential Equations\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\((t,y)\\) & \\(\\Delta t\\) & \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) & \\(\\Delta y=\\phi(t,y)\\Delta t\\) & \\((t+\\Delta t,y+\\Delta y)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0,0)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0\\) & \\(0\\) & \\((0.2,0)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.2,0)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.04\\) & \\((0.4,0.04)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.4,0.04)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.3984\\) & \\(0.07968\\) & \\((0.6,0.11968)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.6,0.11968)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.58\\ldots\\) & \\(0.117\\ldots\\) & \\((0.8,0.236\\ldots)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.8,0.236\\ldots)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.743\\ldots\\) & \\(0.148\\ldots\\) & \\((1.0,0.385\\ldots)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n**Figure 17.4.2** Computing with Euler's Method.\nEuler's method is related to another technique that can help in understanding a differential equation in a qualitative way. Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from exercise 13 in section 17.1, \\(\\dot{y}=ky(M-y)\\): \\(y\\) is a population at time \\(t\\), \\(M\\) is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and \\(k\\) measures the reproduction rate of the population. Figure 17.4.4 shows a slope field for this equation\nthat is quite informative.

Graph \\(f\\) and \\(f^{-1}\\) on the same set of axes and check the symmetry about the line \\(y=x\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n3. To graph \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\) using transformations, we start with \\(j(x)=\\log_{2}(x)\\). We track the points \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},-1\\right)\\), \\((1,0)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) on the graph of \\(j\\) along with the vertical asymptote \\(x=0\\) through the transformations using Theorem 1.7. Since \\(f^{-1}(x)=j(x+3)+1\\), we first subtract 3 from each of the \\(x\\) values (including the vertical asymptote) to obtain \\(\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},-1\\right)\\), \\(\\left(-2,0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(-1,1\\right)\\) with a vertical asymptote \\(x=-3\\). Next, we add 1 to the \\(y\\) values on the graph and get \\(\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\), \\(\\left(-2,1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(-1,2\\right)\\). If you are experiencing _deja vu_, there is a good reason for it but we leave it to the reader to determine the source of this uncanny familiarity. We obtain the graph below. The domain of \\(f^{-1}\\) is \\(\\left(-3,\\infty\\right)\\), which matches the range of \\(f\\), and the range of \\(f^{-1}\\) is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\infty\\right)\\), which matches the domain of \\(f\\).\n4. We now verify that \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) and \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\) satisfy the composition requirement for inverses. For all real numbers \\(x\\),\n\n\n",

These vectors are shown in figure 15.7.4, with the actual region outlined by a dotted boundary. Of course, since both \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly good approximation to the true area.\nThe area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta \\times\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr&=\\left|\\matrix{\\bf i &\\bf j&\\bf k\\cr-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0}&r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0}&0\\cr\\cos\\theta_{0}& \\sin\\theta_{0}&0\\cr}\\right|\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{0}-r_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr.}\\]\nThe length of this vector is \\(r_{0}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\).

A vector tangent to this path is given by the derivative \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(r)=\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\), and a small tangent vector, with length approximately equal to the side of the region, is \\(\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr\\). Likewise, if we fix \\(r=r_{0}=0.5\\), we get the vector function \\({\\bf w}(\\theta)=\\langle r_{0}\\cos\\theta,r_{0}\\sin\\theta,0\\rangle\\) with derivative \\({\\bf w}^{\\prime}(\\theta)=\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta,r_{0}\\cos\\theta,0\\rangle\\) and a small tangent vector \\(\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\) when \\(\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) (at the corner we're focusing on). These vectors are shown in figure 15.7.4, with the actual region outlined by a dotted boundary. Of course, since both \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly good approximation to the true area.\nThe area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta \\times\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr&=\\left|\\matrix{\\bf i &\\bf j&\\bf k\\cr-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0}&r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0}&0\\cr\\cos\\theta_{0}& \\sin\\theta_{0}&0\\cr}\\right|\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{0}-r_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr.}\\]\nThe length of this vector is \\(r_{0}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). So in general, for any values of \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), the area in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane corresponding to a small rectangle anchored at \\((\\theta,r)\\) in the \\(r\\)-\\(\\theta\\) plane is approximately \\(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). In other words, \"\\(r\\)\" replaces the \"?\" in equation 15.7.2.\nIn general, a substitution will start with equations \\(x=f(u,v)\\) and \\(y=g(u,v)\\). Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\).

Is there a global maximum on interval $[0, 1]$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow let's turn our attention to a few of the points on the graph. Clearly the point \\((-2,4.5)\\) does not have the largest \\(y\\) value of all of the points on the graph of \\(f\\,-\\) indeed that honor goes to \\((6,5.5)\\,-\\) but \\((-2,4.5)\\) should get some sort of consolation prize for being 'the top of the hill' between \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=3\\). We say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local maximum8** at the point \\((-2,4.5)\\), because the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(4.5\\) is the largest \\(y\\)-value (hence, function value) on the curve 'near'9\\(x=-2\\). Similarly, we say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local minimum**10 at the point \\((3,-8)\\), since the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(-8\\) is the smallest function value near \\(x=3\\). Although it is tempting to say that local extrema11 occur when the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it is not a precise enough way to define the concepts for the needs of Calculus. At the risk of being pedantic, we will present the traditional definitions and thoroughly vet the pathologies they induce in the Exercises. We have one last observation to make before we proceed to the algebraic definitions and look at a fairly tame, yet helpful, example.\nFootnote 10: Also called a ‘relative minimum’.\nIf we look at the entire graph, we see that the largest \\(y\\) value (the largest function value) is \\(5.5\\) at \\(x=6\\). In this case, we say the **maximum12** of \\(f\\) is \\(5.5\\); similarly, the **minimum13** of \\(f\\) is \\(-8\\).\nFootnote 12: ‘Maxima’ is the plural of ‘maximum’ and ‘mimima’ is the plural of ‘minimum’. ‘Extrema’ is the plural of ‘extremum’ which combines maximum and minimum.\nWe formalize these concepts in the following definitions.\n**Definition 1.11**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a function with \\(f(a)=b\\).\n* We say \\(f\\) has a **local maximum** at the point \\((a,b)\\) if and only if there is an open interval \\(I\\) containing \\(a\\) for which \\(f(a)\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\). The value \\(f(a)=b\\) is called 'a local maximum value of \\(f\\)' in this case.\n* We say \\(f\\) has a **local minimum** at the point \\((a,b)\\) if and only if there is an open interval \\(I\\) containing \\(a\\) for which \\(f(a)\\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\). The value \\(f(a)=b\\) is called 'a local minimum value of \\(f\\)' in this case.\n* The value \\(b\\) is called the **maximum** of \\(f\\) if \\(b\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\).\n* The value \\(b\\) is called the **minimum** of \\(f\\) if \\(b\\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\).\nIt's important to note that not every function will have all of these features. Indeed, it is possible to have a function with no local or absolute extrema at all! (Any ideas of what such a function's graph would have to look like?) We shall see examples of functions in the Exercises which have one or two, but not all, of these features, some that have instances of each type of extremum and some functions that seem to defy common sense. In all cases, though, we shall adhere to the algebraic definitions above as we explore the wonderful diversity of graphs that functions provide us.\nHere is the 'tame' example which was promised earlier. It summarizes all of the concepts presented in this section as well as some from previous sections so you should spend some time thinking deeply about it before proceeding to the Exercises.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFirst note that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=-2x+4=0\\) when \\(x=2\\). But \\(x=2\\) is not in the interval, so we don't use it. Thus the only two points to be checked are the endpoints; \\(f(-1)=-8\\) and \\(f(1)=0\\). So the largest value of \\(f(x)\\) on \\([-1,1]\\) is \\(f(1)=0\\).\n**Example 6.1.5**  Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\(f(x)=7+|x-2|\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(4\\) inclusive. The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is never zero, but \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=2\\), so we compute \\(f(2)=7\\). Checking the end points we get \\(f(1)=8\\) and \\(f(4)=9\\). The smallest of these numbers is \\(f(2)=7\\), which is, therefore, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) on the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 4\\), and the maximum is \\(f(4)=9\\).\n**Example 6.1.6**  Find all local maxima and minima for \\(f(x)=x^{3}-x\\), and determine whether there is a global maximum or minimum on the open interval \\((-2,2)\\). In example 5.1.2 we found a local maximum at \\((-\\sqrt{3}/3,2\\sqrt{3}/9)\\) and a local minimum at \\((\\sqrt{3}/3,-2\\sqrt{3}/9)\\). Since the endpoints are not in the interval \\((-2,2)\\) they cannot be con\n### Chapter 6 Applications of the Derivative\nsidered. Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\). So the question becomes: what happens between \\(-2\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\)? Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than \\(4\\cdot 4\\) which is clearly larger than \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), this settles the question.)\nA similar analysis shows that there is also no global minimum. The graph of \\(f(x)\\) on \\((-2,2)\\) is shown in figure 2.\n**Example 6.1.7**: Of all rectangles of area \\(100\\), which has the smallest perimeter?\nFirst we must translate this into a purely mathematical problem in which we want to find the minimum value of a function. If \\(x\\) denotes one of the sides of the rectangle, then the adjacent side must be \\(100/x\\) (in order that the area be \\(100\\)). So the function we want\n\n\n",

If a sequence is bounded above and bounded below it is **bounded**. If a sequence \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by \\(a_{0}\\)), and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is bounded above (by \\(a_{0}\\)). Finally, with all this new terminology we can state an important theorem.\n**Theorem 11.1.12** If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n**Example 11.1.13** All of the terms \\((2^{i}-1)/2^{i}\\) are less than 2, and the sequence is increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\nAgain we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know.

Solving \\(x^{2}-9=0\\) gives \\(x=\\pm 3\\). In lowest terms \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-x-6}{x^{2}-9}=\\frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x-3)(x+3)}=\\frac{x+2}{x+3}\\). Since \\(x=-3\\) continues to make trouble in the denominator, we know the line \\(x=-3\\) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). Since \\(x=3\\) no longer produces a \\(0\\) in the denominator, we have a hole at \\(x=3\\). To find the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the hole, we substitute \\(x=3\\) into \\(\\frac{x+2}{x+3}\\) and find the hole is at \\(\\left(3,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\). When we graph \\(y=g(x)\\) using a calculator, we clearly see the vertical asymptote at \\(x=-3\\), but everything seems calm near \\(x=3\\). Hence, as \\(x\\to-3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\), as \\(x\\to-3^{+}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\), as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\frac{5}{6}^{-}\\), and as \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\frac{5}{6}^{+}\\).\n3. The domain of \\(h\\) is all real numbers, since \\(x^{2}+9=0\\) has no real solutions. Accordingly, the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) is devoid of both vertical asymptotes and holes.\n4. Setting \\(x^{2}+4x+4=0\\) gives us \\(x=-2\\) as the only real number of concern. Simplifying, we see \\(r(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-x-6}{x^{2}+4x+4}=\\frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x+2)^{2}}=\\frac{x-3}{x+2}\\). Since \\(x=-2\\) continues to produce a \\(0\\) in the denominator of the reduced function, we know \\(x=-2\\) is a vertical asymptote to the graph. The calculator bears this out, and, moreover, we see that as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(r(x)\\to\\infty\\) and as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), \\(r(x)\\to-\\infty\\).\nOur next example gives us a physical interpretation of a vertical asymptote. This type of model arises from a family of equations cheerily named 'doomsday' equations.7\nFootnote 7: These functions arise in Differential Equations. The unfortunate name will make sense shortly.\n**Example 4.1.3**.: A mathematical model for the population \\(P\\), in thousands, of a certain species of bacteria, \\(t\\) days after it is introduced to an environment is given by \\(P(t)=\\frac{100}{(5-t)^{2}}\\), \\(0\\leq t<5\\).\n1.

If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy.

This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval.

The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals.

Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself.

The sign of the second derivative \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) tells us whether \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is increasing or decreasing; we have seen that if \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is zero and increasing at a point then there is a local minimum at the point, and if \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is zero and decreasing at a point then there is a local maximum at the point.

The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\). This point is on the upper hemisphere, so we use \\(f(x,y)=\\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\). Then \\(f_{x}(x,y)=-x(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\) and \\(f_{y}(x,y)=-y(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\), so \\(f_{x}(1,1)=f_{y}(1,1)=-1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and the equation of the plane is\n\\[z=-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(x-1)-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(y-1)+\\sqrt{2}.\\]\nThe hemisphere and this tangent plane are pictured in figure 14.3.3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it appears that to find a tangent plane, we need only find two quite simple ordinary derivatives, namely \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\). This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n**362 Chapter 14 Partial Differentiation**\nWhen does a surface have a tangent plane at a particular point? What we really want from a tangent plane, as from a tangent line, is that the plane be a \"good\" approximation of the surface near the point. Here is how we can make this precise:\n**DEFINITION 14.3.4** Let \\(\\Delta x=x-x_{0}\\), \\(\\Delta y=y-y_{0}\\), and \\(\\Delta z=z-z_{0}\\) where \\(z_{0}=f(x_{0},y_{0})\\). The function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at \\((x_{0},y_{0})\\) if\n\\[\\Delta z=f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})\\Delta x+f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})\\Delta y+\\epsilon_{1} \\Delta x+\\epsilon_{2}\\Delta y,\\]\nand both \\(\\epsilon_{1}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{2}\\) approach 0 as \\((x,y)\\) approaches \\((x_{0},y_{0})\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThis definition takes a bit of absorbing. Let's rewrite the central equation a bit:\n\\[z=f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})(x-x_{0})+f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})(y-y_{0})+f(x_{0},y_{0})+ \\epsilon_{1}\\Delta x+\\epsilon_{2}\\Delta y.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[(a+b)^{k+1} = a^{k+1}+\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\binom{k+1}{j}a^{k+1-j}b^{j}+b^{k+1}\\] \\[= \\binom{k+1}{0}a^{k+1}b^{0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\binom{k+1}{j}a^{k+1-j}b ^{j}+\\binom{k+1}{k+1}a^{0}b^{k+1}\\] \\[= \\sum_{j=0}^{k+1}\\binom{k+1}{j}a^{(k+1)-j}b^{j}\\]\nwhich shows that \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Hence, by induction, we have established that the Binomial Theorem holds for all natural numbers \\(n\\).\n**Example 9.4.2**.: Use the Binomial Theorem to find the following.\n1. \\((x-2)^{4}\\) \\(2.\\ 2.1^{3}\\)\n3. The term containing \\(x^{3}\\) in the expansion \\((2x+y)^{5}\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. Since \\((x-2)^{4}=(x+(-2))^{4}\\), we identify \\(a=x\\), \\(b=-2\\) and \\(n=4\\) and obtain\n\\[(x-2)^{4} =\\sum_{j=0}^{4}\\binom{4}{j}x^{4-j}(-2)^{j}\\] \\[=\\binom{4}{0}x^{4-0}(-2)^{0}+\\binom{4}{1}x^{4-1}(-2)^{1}+\\binom{4}{2} x^{4-2}(-2)^{2}+\\binom{4}{3}x^{4-3}(-2)^{3}+\\binom{4}{4}x^{4-4}(-2)^{4}\\] \\[=x^{4}-8x^{3}+24x^{2}-32x+16\\]\n2. At first this problem seem misplaced, but we can write \\(2.1^{3}=(2+0.1)^{3}\\). Identifying \\(a=2\\), \\(b=0.1=\\frac{1}{10}\\) and \\(n=3\\), we get \\[\\left(2+\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{3} = \\sum_{j=0}^{3}\\binom{3}{j}2^{3-j}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{j}\\] \\[= \\binom{3}{0}2^{3-0}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{0}+\\binom{3}{1}2^{ 3-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{1}+\\binom{3}{2}2^{3-2}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) ^{2}+\\binom{3}{3}2^{3-3}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{3}\\] \\[= 8+\\frac{12}{10}+\\frac{6}{100}+\\frac{1}{1000}\\] \\[= 8+1.2+0.06+0.001\\] \\[= 9.261\\]\n3. Identifying \\(a=2x\\), \\(b=y\\) and \\(n=5\\), the Binomial Theorem gives \\[(2x+y)^{5}=\\sum_{j=0}^{5}\\binom{5}{j}(2x)^{5-j}y^{j}\\] Since we are concerned with only the term containing \\(x^{3}\\), there is no need to expand the entire sum. The exponents on each term must add to \\(5\\) and if the exponent on \\(x\\) is \\(3\\), the exponent on \\(y\\) must be \\(2\\). Plucking out the term \\(j=2\\), we get \\[\\binom{5}{2}(2x)^{5-2}y^{2}=10(2x)^{3}y^{2}=80x^{3}y^{2}\\]\nWe close this section with Pascal's Triangle, named in honor of the mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal's Triangle is obtained by arranging the binomial coefficients in the triangular fashion below.\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 3\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nSince \\(\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}=1\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ n\\end{pmatrix}=1\\) for all whole numbers \\(n\\), we get that each row of Pascal's Triangle begins and ends with 1. To generate the numbers in the middle of the rows (from the third row onwards), we take advantage of the additive relationship expressed in Theorem 9.3. For instance, \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\) and so forth. This relationship is indicated by the arrows in the array above. With these two facts in hand, we can quickly generate Pascal's Triangle. We start with the first two rows, 1 and 1 1. From that point on, each successive row begins and ends with 1 and the middle numbers are generated using Theorem 9.3. Below we attempt to demonstrate this building process to generate the first five rows of Pascal's Triangle.\nTo see how we can use Pascal's Triangle to expedite the Binomial Theorem, suppose we wish to expand \\((3x-y)^{4}\\). The coefficients we need are \\(\\binom{4}{j}\\) for \\(j=0,1,2,3,4\\) and are the numbers which form the fifth row of Pascal's Triangle. Since we know that the exponent of \\(3x\\) in the first term is \\(4\\) and then decreases by one as we go from left to right while the exponent of \\(-y\\) starts at \\(0\\) in the first term and then increases by one as we move from left to right, we quickly obtain\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(3x-y)^{4}&=&(1)(3x)^{4}+(4)(3x)^{3}(-y)+(6)(3x)^{2}(-y)^{2 }+4(3x)(-y)^{3}+1(-y)^{4}\\\\ &=&81x^{4}-108x^{3}y+54x^{2}y^{2}-12xy^{3}+y^{4}\\end{array}\\]\nWe would like to stress that Pascal's Triangle is a very quick method to expand an _entire_ binomial. If only a term (or two or three) is required, then the Binomial Theorem is definitely the way to go.\n#### Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 9, simplify the given expression.\n1. \\(\\left(3!\\right)^{2}\\) 2. \\(\\frac{10!}{7!}\\) 3. \\(\\frac{7!}{2^{3}3!}\\)\n\n\n",

When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well. So along every line through the origin \\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(0\\). Now suppose we approach the origin along \\(x=y^{2}\\). Then\n\\[f(x,y)={y^{2}y^{2}\\over y^{4}+y^{4}}={y^{4}\\over 2y^{4}}={1\\over 2},\\]\nso the limit is \\(1/2\\). Looking at figure 14.2.1, it is apparent that there is a ridge above \\(x=y^{2}\\). Approaching the origin along a straight line, we go over the ridge and then drop down toward \\(0\\), but approaching along the ridge the height is a constant \\(1/2\\). Thus, there is no limit at \\((0,0)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFortunately, we can define the concept of limit without needing to specify how a particular point is approached--indeed, in definition 2.3.2, we didn't need the concept of \"approach.\" Roughly, that definition says that when \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\) then \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\); there is no mention of \"how\" we get close to \\(a\\). We can adapt that definition to two variables quite easily:\n**DEFINITION 14.2.2** Limit Suppose \\(f(x,y)\\) is a function. We say that\n\\[\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\]\nif for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}}<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.1**\\(f(x,y)=\\frac{xy^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{4}}\\) (AP)\nThis says that we can make \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\), no matter how small \\(\\epsilon\\) is, by making the distance from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((a,b)\\) \"small enough\".\n**Example 14.2.3** We show that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}=0\\). Suppose \\(\\epsilon>0\\).

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers.

An obvious guess for the derivative of \\(f\\) is the product of the derivatives of the constituent functions: \\((2x)(3x^{2}-3)=6x^{3}-6x\\). Is this correct? We can easily check, by rewriting \\(f\\) and doing the calculation in a way that is known to work. First, \\(f(x)=x^{5}-3x^{3}+x^{3}-3x=x^{5}-2x^{3}-3x\\), and then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=5x^{4}-6x^{2}-3\\). Not even close! What went \"wrong\"? Well, nothing really, except the guess was wrong.\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\nReturning to the example we started with, let \\(f(x)=(x^{2}+1)(x^{3}-3x)\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=(x^{2}+1)(3x^{2}-3)+(2x)(x^{3}-3x)=3x^{4}-3x^{2}+3x^{2}-3+2x^{4} -6x^{2}=5x^{4}-6x^{2}-3\\), as before. In this case it is probably simpler to multiply \\(f(x)\\) out first, then compute the derivative; here's an example for which we really need the product rule.\n**EXAMPLE 3.3.1** Compute the derivative of \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\). We have already computed \\({d\\over dx}\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}={-x\\over\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}}\\). Now\n\\[f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{2}{-x\\over\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}}+2x\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}={-x^{3}+2x(625 -x^{2})\\over\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}}={-3x^{3}+1250x\\over\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}}.\\]\n\\(\\sqcap\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nExercises 3.3.\nIn 1-4, find the derivatives of the functions using the product rule.\n**1.**\\(x^{3}(x^{3}-5x+10)\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**2.**\\((x^{2}+5x-3)(x^{5}-6x^{3}+3x^{2}-7x+1)\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**3.**\\(\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**4.**\\({\\sqrt{625-x^{2}}\\over x^{20}}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**5.** Use the product rule to compute the derivative of \\(f(x)=(2x-3)^{2}\\).

Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\narea under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areas is less than the area under the entire curve, that is, all the way to infinity. There is a bit of trouble at the left end, where there is an asymptote, but we can work around that easily. Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe already know that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\nThe rectangles this time are above the curve, that is, each rectangle completely contains the corresponding area under the curve. This means that\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}>\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1 \\over x}\\,dx=\\ln x\\Big{|}_{1}^{n+1}=\\ln(n+1).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets bigger, \\(\\ln(n+1)\\) goes to infinity, so the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) must also go to infinity, so the harmonic series diverges. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 11.3.2** Graph of \\(y=1/x\\) with rectangles.\nThe important fact that clinches this example is that\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty,\\]\nwhich we can rewrite as\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty.\\]\nSo these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the **integral test**, which we state as a theorem.\n**Theorem 11.3.3** Suppose that \\(f(x)>0\\) and is decreasing on the infinite interval \\([k,\\infty)\\) (for some \\(k\\geq 1\\)) and that \\(a_{n}=f(n)\\). Then the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges if and only if the improper integral \\(\\int_{1}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,dx\\) converges.\nThe two examples we have seen are called \\(p\\)-series; a \\(p\\)-series is any series of the form \\(\\sum 1/n^{p}\\). If \\(p\\leq 0\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}1/n^{p}\\neq 0\\), so the series diverges. For positive values of \\(p\\) we can determine precisely which series converge.\n**Theorem 11.3.4** A \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>0\\) converges if and only if \\(p>1\\).\n_Proof._ We use the integral test; we have already done \\(p=1\\), so assume that \\(p\\neq 1\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 11.7 The Ratio and Root Tests\nDoes the series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}\\) converge? It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it).

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nWhat is \\lim_{x \\to 0} (csc(x) - cot(x))?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) as read from the graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.\nThe properties of the tangent and cotangent functions are summarized below. As with Theorem 10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.\n**Theorem 10.25**. **Properties of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions**\n* The function \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\)\n* has domain \\(\\left\\{x:x\\neq\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k,\\ k\\ \\mbox{is an integer}\\right\\}=\\bigcup_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2},\\frac{(2k+3)\\pi}{2}\\right)\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\nTo compute the desired limit it is sufficient to compute the limits of the two final fractions, as \\(x\\) goes to 0. The first of these is the hard limit we've just done, namely 1. The second turns out to be simple, because the denominator presents no problem:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\sin 0}{\\cos 0+1}=\\frac{0}{2}=0.\\]\nThus,\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=0.\\]\nExercises 4.3. **1.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(5x)}{x}\\Rightarrow\\) **2.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(7x)}{\\sin(2x)}\\Rightarrow\\) **3.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cot(4x)}{\\csc(3x)}\\Rightarrow\\) **4.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\tan x}{x}\\Rightarrow\\) **5.** Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pi/4}\\frac{\\sin x-\\cos x}{\\cos(2x)}\\Rightarrow\\) **6.** For all \\(x\\geq 0\\), \\(4x-9\\leq f(x)\\leq x^{2}-4x+7\\).

To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).

We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary.

(You may want to review the concepts in section 9.6.)\nThe key to the computation, just as before, is the approximation of mass. In the two-dimensional case, we treat density \\(\\sigma\\) as mass per square area, so when density is constant, mass is (density)(area). If we have a two-dimensional region with varying density given by \\(\\sigma(x,y)\\), and we divide the region into small subregions with area \\(\\Delta A\\), then the mass of one subregion is approximately \\(\\sigma(x_{i},y_{j})\\Delta A\\), the total mass is approximately the sum of many of these, and as usual the sum turns into an integral in the limit:\n\\[M=\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\\int_{y_{0}}^{y_{1}}\\sigma(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx,\\]\nand similarly for computations in cylindrical coordinates. Then as before\n\\[M_{x} =\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\\int_{y_{0}}^{y_{1}}y\\sigma(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx\\] \\[M_{y} =\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\\int_{y_{0}}^{y_{1}}x\\sigma(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\n**Example 15.3.1** Find the center of mass of a thin, uniform plate whose shape is the region between \\(y=\\cos x\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis between \\(x=-\\pi/2\\) and \\(x=\\pi/2\\). Since the density is constant, we may take \\(\\sigma(x,y)=1\\).\nIt is clear that \\(\\bar{x}=0\\), but for practice let's compute it anyway. First we compute the mass:\n\\[M=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}1\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\cos x \\,dx=\\left.\\sin x\\right|_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}=2.\\]\nNext,\n\\[M_{x}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}y\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^{2}x\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]\nFinally,\n\\[M_{y}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}x\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}x\\cos x \\,dx=0.\\]\nSo \\(\\bar{x}=0\\) as expected, and \\(\\bar{y}=\\pi/4/2=\\pi/8\\). This is the same problem as in example 9.6.4; it may be helpful to compare the two solutions. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 15.3.2**: Find the center of mass of a two-dimensional plate that occupies the quarter circle \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\) in the first quadrant and has density \\(k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\). It seems clear that because of the symmetry of both the region and the density function (both are important!), \\(\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}\\). We'll do both to check our work.\nJumping right in:\n\\[M=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\,dy\\,dx=k\\int_{0}^{1}x^{ 2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\\frac{(1-x^{2})^{3/2}}{3}\\,dx.\\]\nThis integral is something we can do, but it's a bit unpleasant. Since everything in sight is related to a circle, let's back up and try polar coordinates. Then \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\\) and\n\\[M=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}k(r^{2})\\,r\\,dr\\,d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\left. \\frac{r^{4}}{4}\\right|_{0}^{1}d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\left.\\frac{1}{4}\\,d \\theta=k\\frac{\\pi}{8}.\\]\nMuch better. Next, since \\(y=r\\sin\\theta\\),\n\\[M_{x}=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}r^{4}\\sin\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{ \\pi/2}\\left.\\frac{1}{5}\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta=k\\,-\\frac{1}{5}\\cos\\theta\\right|_{0 }^{\\pi/2}=\\frac{k}{5}.\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[M_{y}=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}r^{4}\\cos\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{ \\pi/2}\\left.\\frac{1}{5}\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta=k\\,\\left.\\frac{1}{5}\\sin\\theta \\right|_{0}^{\\pi/2}=\\frac{k}{5}.\\]\nFinally, \\(\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}=\\frac{8}{5\\pi}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Exercises 15.3**:\n1.

We first consider \\(y=1+\\cos x\\), as in figure 10.1.2. As \\(\\theta\\) goes through the values in \\([0,2\\pi]\\), the value of \\(r\\) tracks the value of \\(y\\), forming the \"cardioid\" shape of figure 10.1.2. For example, when \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\), \\(r=1+\\cos(\\pi/2)=1\\), so we graph the point at distance \\(1\\) from the origin along the positive \\(y\\)-axis, which is at an angle of \\(\\pi/2\\) from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. When \\(\\theta=7\\pi/4\\), \\(r=1+\\cos(7\\pi/4)=1+\\sqrt{2}/2\\approx 1.71\\), and the corresponding point appears in the fourth quadrant. This illustrates one of the potential benefits of using polar coordinates: the equation for this curve in rectangular coordinates would be quite complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 10.1.2** A cardioid: \\(y=1+\\cos x\\) on the left, \\(r=1+\\cos\\theta\\) on the right.\nEach point in the plane is associated with exactly one pair of numbers in the rectangular coordinate system; each point is associated with an infinite number of pairs in polar coordinates. In the cardioid example, we considered only the range \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi\\), and already there was a duplicate: \\((2,0)\\) and \\((2,2\\pi)\\) are the same point. Indeed, every value of \\(\\theta\\) outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\) duplicates a point on the curve \\(r=1+\\cos\\theta\\) when \\(0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi\\). We can even make sense of polar coordinates like \\((-2,\\pi/4)\\): go to the direction \\(\\pi/4\\) and then move a distance \\(2\\) in the opposite direction; see figure 10.1.3. As usual, a negative angle \\(\\theta\\) means an angle measured clockwise from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. The point in figure 10.1.3 also has coordinates \\((2,5\\pi/4)\\) and \\((2,-3\\pi/4)\\).\nThe relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates is quite easy to understand. The point with polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\) has rectangular coordinates \\(x=r\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(y=r\\sin\\theta\\); this follows immediately from the definition of the sine and cosine functions. Using figure 10.1.3 as an example, the point shown has rectangular coordinates\n### Polar Coordinates\nThe point \\((-2,\\pi/4)=(2,5\\pi/4)=(2,-3\\pi/4)\\) in polar coordinates. We merely substitute: \\(r\\sin\\theta=3r\\cos\\theta+2\\), or \\(r=\\frac{2}{\\sin\\theta-3\\cos\\theta}\\).\n**Example 10.1.4**: Find the equation of the circle \\((x-1/2)^{2}+y^{2}=1/4\\) in polar coordinates. Again substituting: \\((r\\cos\\theta-1/2)^{2}+r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta=1/4\\). A bit of algebra turns this into \\(r=\\cos(t)\\). You should try plotting a few \\((r,\\theta)\\) values to convince yourself that this makes sense.\n**Example 10.1.5**: Graph the polar equation \\(r=\\theta\\). Here the distance from the origin exactly matches the angle, so a bit of thought makes it clear that when \\(\\theta\\geq 0\\) we get the spiral of Archimedes in figure 10.1.4. When \\(\\theta<0\\), \\(r\\) is also negative, and so the full graph is the right hand picture in the figure.\nConverting polar equations to rectangular equations can be somewhat trickier, and graphing polar equations directly is also not always easy.\nFigure 10.1.4: The spiral of Archimedes and the full graph of \\(r=\\theta\\).\n**Example 10.1.6**: Graph \\(r=2\\sin\\theta\\). Because the sine is periodic, we know that we will get the entire curve for values of \\(\\theta\\) in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). As \\(\\theta\\) runs from \\(0\\) to \\(\\pi/2\\), \\(r\\) increases from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\). Then as \\(\\theta\\) continues to \\(\\pi\\), \\(r\\) decreases again to \\(0\\). When \\(\\theta\\) runs from \\(\\pi\\) to \\(2\\pi\\), \\(r\\) is negative, and it is not hard to see that the first part of the curve is simply traced out again, so in fact we get the whole curve for values of \\(\\theta\\) in \\([0,\\pi)\\). Thus, the curve looks something like figure 10.1.5. Now, this suggests that the curve could possibly be a circle, and if it is, it would have to be the circle \\(x^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=1\\). Having made this guess, we can easily check it. First we substitute for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to get \\((r\\cos\\theta)^{2}+(r\\sin\\theta-1)^{2}=1\\); expanding and simplifying does indeed turn this into \\(r=2\\sin\\theta\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n_Exercises 10.1._\n\n\n",

We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\).

What is h''(x) when x = 1?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n1. \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{4-3x}\\) 2. \\(h(x)=\\sqrt[5]{4-3x}\\)\n3. \\(f(x)=\\frac{2}{1-\\frac{4x}{x-3}}\\) 4. \\(F(x)=\\frac{4\\sqrt{2x+1}}{x^{2}-1}\\)\n5. \\(r(t)=\\frac{4}{6-\\sqrt{t+3}}\\) 6. \\(I(x)=\\frac{3x^{2}}{x}\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n4. In finding the domain of \\(F\\), we notice that we have two potentially hazardous issues: not only do we have a denominator, we have a fourth (even-indexed) root. Our strategy is to determine the restrictions imposed by each part and select the real numbers which satisfy both conditions. To satisfy the fourth root, we require \\(2x+1\\geq 0\\). From this we get \\(2x\\geq-1\\) or \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Next, we round up the values of \\(x\\) which could cause trouble in the denominator by setting the denominator equal to \\(0\\). We get \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), or \\(x=\\pm 1\\). Hence, in order for a real number \\(x\\) to be in the domain of \\(F\\), \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but \\(x\\neq\\pm 1\\). In interval notation, this set is \\(\\left[-\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n5. Don't be put off by the '\\(t\\)' here. It is an independent variable representing a real number, just like \\(x\\) does, and is subject to the same restrictions. As in the previous problem, we have double danger here: we have a square root and a denominator. To satisfy the square root, we need a non-negative radicand so we set \\(t+3\\geq 0\\) to get \\(t\\geq-3\\). Setting the denominator equal to zero gives \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=0\\), or \\(\\sqrt{t+3}=6\\). Squaring both sides gives \\(t+3=36\\), or \\(t=33\\). Since we squared both sides in the course of solving this equation, we need to check our answer.5 Sure enough, when \\(t=33\\), \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=6-\\sqrt{36}=0\\), so \\(t=33\\) will cause problems in the denominator. At last we can find the domain of \\(r\\): we need \\(t\\geq-3\\), but \\(t\\neq 33\\). Our final answer is \\([-3,33)\\cup(33,\\infty)\\). Footnote 5: Do you remember why? Consider squaring both sides to ‘solve’ \\(\\sqrt{t+1}=-2\\).\n6. It's tempting to simplify \\(I(x)=\\frac{3x^{2}}{x}=3x\\), and, since there are no longer any denominators, claim that there are no longer any restrictions. However, in simplifying \\(I(x)\\), we are assuming \\(x\\neq 0\\), since \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) is undefined.6 Proceeding as before, we find the domain of \\(I\\) to be all real numbers except \\(0\\): \\((-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 5.1.2**.: The surface area \\(S\\) of a sphere is a function of its radius \\(r\\) and is given by the formula \\(S(r)=4\\pi r^{2}\\). Suppose the sphere is being inflated so that the radius of the sphere is increasing according to the formula \\(r(t)=3t^{2}\\), where \\(t\\) is measured in seconds, \\(t\\geq 0\\), and \\(r\\) is measured in inches. Find and interpret \\((S\\circ r)(t)\\).\n**Solution.** If we look at the functions \\(S(r)\\) and \\(r(t)\\) individually, we see the former gives the surface area of a sphere of a given radius while the latter gives the radius at a given time. So, given a specific time, \\(t\\), we could find the radius at that time, \\(r(t)\\) and feed that into \\(S(r)\\) to find the surface area at that time. From this we see that the surface area \\(S\\) is ultimately a function of time \\(t\\) and we find \\((S\\circ r)(t)=S(r(t))=4\\pi(r(t))^{2}=4\\pi\\left(3t^{2}\\right)^{2}=36\\pi t^{4}\\). This formula allows us to compute the surface area directly given the time without going through the 'middle man' \\(r\\).\nA useful skill in Calculus is to be able to take a complicated function and break it down into a composition of easier functions which our last example illustrates.\n**Example 5.1.3**.: Write each of the following functions as a composition of two or more (non-identity) functions. Check your answer by performing the function composition.\n1. \\(F(x)=|3x-1|\\) \\(2\\). \\(G(x)=\\frac{2}{x^{2}+1}\\) \\(3\\). \\(H(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}\\)\n**Solution.** There are many approaches to this kind of problem, and we showcase a different methodology in each of the solutions below.\n1. Our goal is to express the function \\(F\\) as \\(F=g\\circ f\\) for functions \\(g\\) and \\(f\\). From Definition 5.1, we know \\(F(x)=g(f(x))\\), and we can think of \\(f(x)\\) as being the 'inside' function and \\(g\\) as being the 'outside' function. Looking at \\(F(x)=|3x-1|\\) from an 'inside versus outside' perspective, we can think of \\(3x-1\\) being inside the absolute value symbols. Taking this cue, we define \\(f(x)=3x-1\\). At this point, we have \\(F(x)=|f(x)|\\). What is the outside function? The function which takes the absolute value of its input, \\(g(x)=|x|\\). Sure enough, \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=|f(x)|=|3x-1|=F(x)\\), so we are done.\n2. We attack deconstructing \\(G\\) from an operational approach. Given an input \\(x\\), the first step is to square \\(x\\), then add \\(1\\), then divide the result into \\(2\\). We will assign each of these steps a function so as to write \\(G\\) as a composite of three functions: \\(f\\), \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). Our first function, \\(f\\), is the function that squares its input, \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). The next function is the function that adds \\(1\\) to its input, \\(g(x)=x+1\\). Our last function takes its input and divides it into \\(2\\), \\(h(x)=\\frac{2}{x}\\). The claim is that \\(G=h\\circ g\\circ f\\). We find \\[(h\\circ g\\circ f)(x)=h(g(f(x)))=h(g\\left(x^{2}\\right))=h\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) =\\frac{2}{x^{2}+1}=G(x),\\] so we are done.\n3. If we look \\(H(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}\\) with an eye towards building a complicated function from simpler functions, we see the expression \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is a simple piece of the larger function. If we define \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we have \\(H(x)=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}\\). If we want to decompose \\(H=g\\circ f\\), then we can glean the formula for \\(g(x)\\) by looking at what is being done to \\(f(x)\\). We take \\(g(x)=\\frac{x+1}{x-1}\\), so \\[(g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}=H(x),\\] as required.\n### 5.1 Function Composition\n#### 5.1.1 Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 12, use the given pair of functions to find the following values if they exist.\n* \\((g\\circ f)(0)\\)\n* \\((f\\circ g)(-1)\\)\n* \\((f\\circ g)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\)\n* \\((f\\circ f)(-2)\\)\n\n\n",

If we start with an angle between \\(-\\pi/2\\) and \\(\\pi/2\\) then the arcsine does reverse the sine: \\(\\sin(\\pi/6)=1/2\\) and \\(\\arcsin(1/2)=\\pi/6\\).\nWhat is the derivative of the arcsine? Since this is an inverse function, we can discover the derivative by using implicit differentiation. Suppose \\(y=\\arcsin(x)\\). Then\n\\[\\sin(y)=\\sin(\\arcsin(x))=x.\\]\nNow taking the derivative of both sides, we get\n\\[y^{\\prime}\\cos y=1\\] \\[y^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{\\cos y}\\]\nAs we expect when using implicit differentiation, \\(y\\) appears on the right hand side here. We would certainly prefer to have \\(y^{\\prime}\\) written in terms of \\(x\\), and as in the case of \\(\\ln x\\) we can actually do that here. Since \\(\\sin^{2}y+\\cos^{2}y=1\\), \\(\\cos^{2}y=1-\\sin^{2}y=1-x^{2}\\). So \\(\\cos y=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) , but which is it--plus or minus? It could in general be either, but this isn't \"in general\": since \\(y=\\arcsin(x)\\) we know that \\(-\\pi/2\\leq y\\leq\\pi/2\\), and the cosine of an angle in this interval is always positive. Thus \\(\\cos y=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) and\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\arcsin(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}.\\]\nNote that this agrees with figure 4.9.1: the graph of the arcsine has positive slope everywhere.\nWe can do something similar for the cosine. As with the sine, we must first truncate the cosine so that it can be inverted, as shown in figure 4.9.2. Then we use implicit\n### Chapter 4 Transcendental Functions\ndifferentiation to find that\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\arccos(x)=\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}.\\]\nNote that the truncated cosine uses a different interval than the truncated sine, so that if \\(y=\\arccos(x)\\) we know that \\(0\\leq y\\leq\\pi\\). The computation of the derivative of the arccosine is left as an exercise.\nFinally we look at the tangent; the other trigonometric functions also have \"partial inverses\" but the sine, cosine and tangent are enough for most purposes. The tangent, truncated tangent and inverse tangent are shown in figure 4.9.3; the derivative of the arctangent is left as an exercise.\nExercises 4.9.\n1.

We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))\\,dt+\\int_{b}^{a}P(t,g_{2 }(t))\\,dt =\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))\\,dt-\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{2}(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))-P(t,g_{2}(t))\\,dt\\]\nwhich is the result of the double integral times \\(-1\\), as desired.\nThe equation involving \\(Q\\) is essentially the same, and left as an exercise.\nExercises 16.4.\n1.

We will do this by finding an anti-derivative with respect to \\(x\\), then substituting \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\) and subtracting, as usual. The result will be an expression with no \\(x\\) variable but some occurrences of \\(y\\). Then the outer integral will be an ordinary one-variable problem, with \\(y\\) as the variable.\n**Example 15.1.1**.: Figure 15.1.2 shows the function \\(\\sin(xy)+6/5\\) on \\([0.5,3.5]\\times[0.5,2.5]\\). The volume under this surface is\n\\[\\int_{0.5}^{2.5}\\int_{0.5}^{3.5}\\sin(xy)+\\frac{6}{5}\\,dx\\,dy.\\]\nThe inner integral is\n\\[\\int_{0.5}^{3.5}\\sin(xy)+\\frac{6}{5}\\,dx=\\left.\\frac{-\\cos(xy)}{y}+\\frac{6x}{ 5}\\right|_{0.5}^{3.5}=\\frac{-\\cos(3.5y)}{y}+\\frac{\\cos(0.5y)}{y}+\\frac{18}{5}.\\]\nUnfortunately, this gives a function for which we can't find a simple anti-derivative. To complete the problem we could use Sage or similar software to approximate the integral.\n### 15 Volume and Average Height\nDoing this gives a volume of approximately 8.84, so the average height is approximately \\(8.84/6\\approx 1.47\\).\nBecause addition and multiplication are commutative and associative, we can rewrite the original double sum:\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta x\\Delta y=\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1 }\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta y\\Delta x.\\]\nNow if we repeat the development above, the inner sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(x_{j},y_{i})\\Delta y=\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y) \\,dy,\\]\nand then the outer sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\left(\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y)\\,dy\\right)\\Delta x =\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\nIn other words, we can compute the integrals in either order, first with respect to \\(x\\) then \\(y\\), or vice versa. Thinking of the loaf of bread, this corresponds to slicing the loaf in a direction perpendicular to the first.\nWe haven't really proved that the value of a double integral is equal to the value of the corresponding two single integrals in either order of integration, but provided the function is reasonably nice, this is true; the result is called **Fubini's Theorem**.\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface with slices. (AP)\n##### Example 15.1.2\nWe compute \\(\\iint\\limits_{R}1+(x-1)^{2}+4y^{2}\\,dA\\), where \\(R=[0,3]\\times[0,2]\\), in two ways.\nFirst,\n\\[\\int_{0}^{3}\\int_{0}^{2}1+(x-1)^{2}+4y^{2}\\,dy\\,dx =\\int_{0}^{3}y+(x-1)^{2}y+\\frac{4}{3}y^{3}\\bigg{|}_{0}^{2}\\,dx\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{3}2+2(x-1)^{2}+\\frac{32}{3}\\,dx\\] \\[=\\left.2x+\\frac{2}{3}(x-1)^{3}+\\frac{32}{3}x\\right|_{0}^{3}\\] \\[=6+\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 8+\\frac{32}{3}\\cdot 3-(0-1\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}+0)\\] \\[=44.\\]\nIn the other order:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{0}^{3}1+(x-1)^{2}+4y^{2}\\,dx\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2}x+\\frac{(x-1)^{3}}{3}+4y^{2}x\\bigg{|}_{0}^{3}\\,dy\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2}3+\\frac{8}{3}+12y^{2}+\\frac{1}{3}\\,dy\\] \\[=\\left.3y+\\frac{8}{3}y+4y^{3}+\\frac{1}{3}y\\right|_{0}^{2}\\] \\[=6+\\frac{16}{3}+32+\\frac{2}{3}\\] \\[=44.\\]\nIn this example there is no particular reason to favor one direction over the other; in some cases, one direction might be much easier than the other, so it's usually worth considering the two different possibilities.\nFrequently we will be interested in a region that is not simply a rectangle. Let's compute the volume under the surface \\(x+2y^{2}\\) above the region described by \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\) and \\(0\\leq y\\leq x^{2}\\), shown in figure 15.1.4.\nIn principle there is nothing more difficult about this problem. If we imagine the three-dimensional region under the surface and above the parabolic region as an oddly shaped leaf of bread, we can still slice it up, approximate the volume of\nvolumes up. For example, if we slice perpendicular to the \\(x\\) axis at \\(x_{i}\\), the thickness of a slice will be \\(\\Delta x\\) and the area of the slice will be\n\\[\\int_{0}^{x_{i}^{2}}x_{i}+2y^{2}\\,dy.\\]\nWhen we add these up and take the limit as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to \\(0\\), we get the double integral\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{x^{2}}x+2y^{2}\\,dy\\,dx =\\int_{0}^{1}\\,xy+\\frac{2}{3}y^{3}\\bigg{|}_{0}^{x^{2}}\\,\\,dx\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{3}+\\frac{2}{3}x^{6}\\,dx\\] \\[=\\left.\\frac{x^{4}}{4}+\\frac{2}{21}x^{7}\\right|_{0}^{1}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{2}{21}=\\frac{29}{84}.\\]\nWe could just as well slice the solid perpendicular to the \\(y\\) axis, in which case we get\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{\\sqrt{y}}^{1}x+2y^{2}\\,dx\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{1}\\left.\\frac{x^{2}}{2}+2y^{2}x\\right|_{\\sqrt{y}}^{1}\\, dy\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{2}+2y^{2}-\\frac{y}{2}-2y^{2}\\sqrt{y}\\,dy\\] \\[=\\left.\\frac{y}{2}+\\frac{2}{3}y^{3}-\\frac{y^{2}}{4}-\\frac{4}{7}y^ {7/2}\\right|_{0}^{1}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{4}{7}=\\frac{29}{84}.\\]\nWhat is the average height of the surface over this region? As before, it is the volume divided by the area of the base, but now we need to use integration to compute the area\nFigure 15.4: A parabolic region of integration.\nof the base, since it is not a simple rectangle.

Find the mean velocity of motion between times t=1 and t=10.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 7.1 Two examples\nUp to now we have been concerned with extracting information about how a function changes from the function itself. Given knowledge about an object's position, for example, we want to know the object's speed. Given information about the height of a curve we want to know its slope. We now consider problems that are, whether obviously or not, the reverse of such problems.\n##### Example 7.1.1\nAn object moves in a straight line so that its speed at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(v(t)=3t\\) in, say, cm/sec. If the object is at position 10 on the straight line when \\(t=0\\), where is the object at any time \\(t\\)?\nThere are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult but also more general.\nWe start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at \\(t=0\\) the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, \\(t=1\\)? We know that the speed of the object at time \\(t=0\\) is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when \\(t=1\\). In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at \\(t=1\\), but certainly we can do better. Let's look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object\nat each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from \\(t=0.1\\) to \\(t=0.2\\), we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at \\(t=0.1\\). In this case the object would travel \\((0.3)(0.1)=0.03\\) centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between \\(t=0.2\\) and \\(t=0.3\\) the object would travel \\((0.6)(0.1)=0.06\\) centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object travels\n\\[(0.0)(0.1)+(0.3)(0.1)+(0.6)(0.1)+\\cdots+(2.7)(0.1)=1.35\\]\ncentimeters, ending up at position 11.35. This is a better approximation than 10, certainly, but is still just an approximation. (We know in fact that the object ends up at position 11.5, because we've already done the problem using the first approach.) Presumably, we will get a better approximation if we divide the time into one hundred intervals of a hundredth of a second each, and repeat the process:\n\\[(0.0)(0.01)+(0.03)(0.01)+(0.06)(0.01)+\\cdots+(2.97)(0.01)=1.485.\\]\nWe thus approximate the position as 11.485. Since we know the exact answer, we can see that this is much closer, but if we did not already know the answer, we wouldn't really know how close.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### Harmonic Motion\nOne of the major applications of sinusoids in Science and Engineering is the study of **harmonic motion**. The equations for harmonic motion can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena, from the motion of an object on a spring, to the response of an electronic circuit. In this subsection, we restrict our attention to modeling a simple spring system. Before we jump into the Mathematics, there are some Physics terms and concepts we need to discuss. In Physics, 'mass' is defined as a measure of an object's resistance to straight-line motion whereas 'weight' is the amount of force (pull) gravity exerts on an object. An object's mass cannot change,8 while its weight could change.\nAn object which weighs 6 pounds on the surface of the Earth would weigh 1 pound on the surface of the Moon, but its mass is the same in both places. In the English system of units, 'pounds' (lbs.) is a measure of force (weight), and the corresponding unit of mass is the 'slug'. In the SI system, the unit of force is 'Newtons' (N) and the associated unit of mass is the 'kilogram' (kg). We convert between mass and weight using the formula9\\(w=mg\\). Here, \\(w\\) is the weight of the object, \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In the English system, \\(g=32\\frac{\\text{fect}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\), and in the SI system, \\(g=9.8\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\). Hence, on Earth a _mass_ of 1 slug _weighs_ 32 lbs. and a _mass_ of 1 kg _weighs_ 9.8 N.10 Suppose we attach an object with mass \\(m\\) to a spring as depicted below. The weight of the object will stretch the spring. The system is said to be in 'equilibrium' when the weight of the object is perfectly balanced with the restorative force of the spring. How far the spring stretches to reach equilibrium depends on the spring's 'spring constant'. Usually denoted by the letter \\(k\\), the spring constant relates the force \\(F\\) applied to the spring to the amount \\(d\\) the spring stretches in accordance with Hooke's Law11\\(F=kd\\). If the object is released above or below the equilibrium position, or if the object is released with an upward or downward velocity, the object will bounce up and down on the end of the spring until some external force stops it. If we let \\(x(t)\\) denote the object's displacement from the equilibrium position at time \\(t\\), then \\(x(t)=0\\) means the object is at the equilibrium position, \\(x(t)<0\\) means the object is _above_ the equilibrium position, and \\(x(t)>0\\) means the object is _below_ the equilibrium position. The function \\(x(t)\\) is called the 'equation of motion' of the object.12\nFootnote 9: This is a consequence of Newton’s Second Law of Motion \\(F=ma\\) where \\(F\\) is force, \\(m\\) is mass and \\(a\\) is acceleration. In our present setting, the force involved is weight which is caused by the acceleration due to gravity.\nFootnote 10: Note that 1 pound = 1 \\(\\frac{\\text{slug foot}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\) and 1 Newton = 1 \\(\\frac{\\text{kg meter}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\).\n\n\n",

The \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-model is a \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-model, and the \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-model is a \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-model.\nis not in the domain of the truncated sine.

Since this is an inverse function, we can discover the derivative by using implicit differentiation. Suppose \\(y=\\arcsin(x)\\). Then\n\\[\\sin(y)=\\sin(\\arcsin(x))=x.\\]\nNow taking the derivative of both sides, we get\n\\[y^{\\prime}\\cos y=1\\] \\[y^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{\\cos y}\\]\nAs we expect when using implicit differentiation, \\(y\\) appears on the right hand side here.

In many cases it is possible at least to determine whether or not the series converges, and so we will spend most of our time on this problem.\nIf all of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the terms \\(a_{n}\\) approach zero, but this does not mean that \\(a_{n}\\geq a_{n+1}\\) for every \\(n\\). Many useful and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to understand. Let's look at an example.\n##### Example 11.3.1\nShow that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges.\nThe terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) are positive and decreasing, and since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1/x^{2}=0\\), the terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number \\(N\\) so that \\(s_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\). The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is inherent in figure 11.\nThe figure shows the graph of \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\narea under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areas is less than the area under the entire curve, that is, all the way to infinity. There is a bit of trouble at the left end, where there is an asymptote, but we can work around that easily. Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe already know that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nLet \\(R\\) be the radius of the sphere, and let \\(r\\) and \\(h\\) be the base radius and height of the cone inside the sphere. What we want to maximize is the volume of the cone: \\(\\pi r^{2}h/3\\). Here \\(R\\) is a fixed value, but \\(r\\) and \\(h\\) can vary. Namely, we could choose \\(r\\) to be as large as possible--equal to \\(R\\)--by taking the height equal to \\(R\\); or we could make the cone's height \\(h\\) larger at the expense of making \\(r\\) a little less than \\(R\\). See the cross-section depicted in figure 6.1.3.\nFigure 6.1.3: Rectangle in a parabola.\nFigure 6.1.4. We have situated the picture in a convenient way relative to the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, namely, with the center of the sphere at the origin and the vertex of the cone at the far left on the \\(x\\)-axis.\nNotice that the function we want to maximize, \\(\\pi r^{2}h/3\\), depends on _two_ variables. This is frequently the case, but often the two variables are related in some way so that \"really\" there is only one variable. So our next step is to find the relationship and use it to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, so as to have a function of only one variable to maximize. In this problem, the condition is apparent in the figure: the upper corner of the triangle, whose coordinates are \\((h-R,r)\\), must be on the circle of radius \\(R\\). That is,\n\\[(h-R)^{2}+r^{2}=R^{2}.\\]\nWe can solve for \\(h\\) in terms of \\(r\\) or for \\(r\\) in terms of \\(h\\). Either involves taking a square root, but we notice that the volume function contains \\(r^{2}\\), not \\(r\\) by itself, so it is easiest to solve for \\(r^{2}\\) directly: \\(r^{2}=R^{2}-(h-R)^{2}\\). Then we substitute the result into \\(\\pi r^{2}h/3\\):\n\\[V(h) =\\pi(R^{2}-(h-R)^{2})h/3\\] \\[=-\\frac{\\pi}{3}h^{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\pi h^{2}R\\]\nWe want to maximize \\(V(h)\\) when \\(h\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(2R\\). Now we solve \\(0=f^{\\prime}(h)=-\\pi h^{2}+(4/3)\\pi hR\\), getting \\(h=0\\) or \\(h=4R/3\\). We compute \\(V(0)=V(2R)=0\\) and \\(V(4R/3)=(32/81)\\pi R^{3}\\). The maximum is the latter; since the volume of the sphere is \\((4/3)\\pi R^{3}\\), the fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is\n\\[\\frac{(32/81)\\pi R^{3}}{(4/3)\\pi R^{3}}=\\frac{8}{27}\\approx 30\\%.\\]\n**Example 6.1.11**: You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume. Suppose that the top and bottom are made of a material that is \\(N\\) times as expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of the cylinder. Find (in terms of \\(N\\)) the ratio of height to base radius of the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making the containers.\nLet us first choose letters to represent various things: \\(h\\) for the height, \\(r\\) for the base radius, \\(V\\) for the volume of the cylinder, and \\(c\\) for the cost per unit area of the lateral side of the cylinder; \\(V\\) and \\(c\\) are constants, \\(h\\) and \\(r\\) are variables. Now we can write the cost of materials:\n\\[c(2\\pi rh)+Nc(2\\pi r^{2}).\\]\nAgain we have two variables; the relationship is provided by the fixed volume of the cylinder: \\(V=\\pi r^{2}h\\). We use this relationship to eliminate \\(h\\) (we could eliminate \\(r\\), but it's a little easier if we eliminate \\(h\\), which appears in only one place in the above formula for cost). The result is\n\\[f(r)=2c\\pi r\\frac{V}{\\pi r^{2}}+2Nc\\pi r^{2}=\\frac{2cV}{r}+2Nc\\pi r^{2}.\\]\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nDoes 2^x +1/x = -4 have a solution?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nLet's review some laws of exponents and logarithms; let \\(a\\) be a positive number. Since \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\), it's clear that \\(a^{5}\\cdot a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a=a^{8}=a^{5 +3}\\), and in general that \\(a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\). Since \"the logarithm is the exponent,\" it's no surprise that this translates directly into a fact about the logarithm function. Here are three facts\nfrom the example: \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5})=5\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{3})=3\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8\\). So \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5}a^{3})=\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8=5+3=\\log_{a}(a^{5})+\\log_{a}(a^{3})\\). Now let's make this a bit more general. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two numbers, \\(A=a^{x}\\), and \\(B=a^{y}\\). Then \\(\\log_{a}(AB)=\\log_{a}(a^{x}a^{y})=\\log_{a}(a^{x+y})=x+y=\\log_{a}(A)+\\log_{a}(B)\\).\nNow consider \\((a^{5})^{3}=a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}=a^{5+5+5}=a^{5\\cdot 3}=a^{15}\\). Again it's clear that more generally \\((a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}\\), and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If \\(A=a^{x}\\) then \\(A^{y}=(a^{x})^{y}=a^{xy}\\), so \\(\\log_{a}(A^{y})=xy=y\\log_{a}(A)\\)--the exponent can be \"pulled out in front.\"\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\begin{array}{rccc}&6x-12y&=&18\\\\ +&(-6x+12y&=&-18)\\\\ \\hline&0&=&0\\end{array}\\]\nWe eliminated not only the \\(x\\), but the \\(y\\) as well and we are left with the identity \\(0=0\\). This means that these two different linear equations are, in fact, equivalent. In other words, if an ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(2x-4y=6\\), it _automatically_ satisfies the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\). One way to describe the solution set to this system is to use the roster method2 and write \\(\\{(x,y)\\,|\\,2x-4y=6\\}\\). While this is correct (and corresponds exactly to what's happening graphically, as we shall see shortly), we take this opportunity to introduce the notion of a **parametric solution to a system**. Our first step is to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for one of the variables, say \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\). For each value of \\(x\\), the formula \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\) determines the corresponding \\(y\\)-value of a solution. Since we have no restriction on \\(x\\), it is called a **free variable**. We let \\(x=t\\), a so-called 'parameter', and get \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\). Our set of solutions can then be described as \\(\\big{\\{}\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\mid-\\infty<t<\\infty\\big{\\}}\\).3 For specific values of \\(t\\), we can generate solutions. For example, \\(t=0\\) gives us the solution \\(\\big{(}0,-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\); \\(t=117\\) gives us \\((117,57)\\), and while we can readily check each of these particular solutions satisfy both equations, the question is how do we check our general answer algebraically? Same as always. We claim that for any real number \\(t\\), the pair \\(\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\) satisfies both equations. Substituting \\(x=t\\) and \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\) into \\(2x-4y=6\\) gives \\(2t-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=6\\). Simplifying, we get \\(2t-2t+6=6\\), which is always true. Similarly, when we make these substitutions in the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\), we get \\(3t-6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=9\\) which reduces to \\(3t-3t+9=9\\), so it checks out, too. Geometrically, \\(2x-4y=6\\) and \\(3x-6y=9\\) are the same line, which means that they intersect at every point on their graphs. The reader is encouraged to think about how our parametric solution says exactly that.\nFootnote 2: See Section 1.2 for a review of this.\nFootnote 3: Note that we could have just as easily chosen to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for \\(x\\) to obtain \\(x=2y+3\\). Letting \\(y\\) be the parameter \\(t\\), we have that for any value of \\(t\\), \\(x=2t+3\\), which gives \\(\\{(2t+3,t)\\,|\\,-\\infty<t<\\infty\\}\\). There is no one correct way to parameterize the solution set, which is why it is always best to check your answer.\n\\[\\begin{array}{rccc}&6x-12y&=&18\\\\ +&(-6x+12y&=&-18)\\\\ \\hline&0&=&0\\end{array}\\]\nWe eliminated not only the \\(x\\), but the \\(y\\) as well and we are left with the identity \\(0=0\\). This means that these two different linear equations are, in fact, equivalent. In other words, if an ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(2x-4y=6\\), it _automatically_ satisfies the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\). One way to describe the solution set to this system is to use the roster method2 and write \\(\\{(x,y)\\,|\\,2x-4y=6\\}\\). While this is correct (and corresponds exactly to what's happening graphically, as we shall see shortly), we take this opportunity to introduce the notion of a **parametric solution to a system**.\n5. Multiplying both sides of the first equation by 2 and the both sides of the second equation by \\(-3\\), we set the stage to eliminate \\(x\\) \\[\\begin{array}{rccc}&12x+6y&=&18\\\\ +&(-12x-6y&=&-36)\\\\ \\hline&&0&=&-18\\end{array}\\] As in the previous example, both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) dropped out of the equation, but we are left with an irrevocable contradiction, \\(0=-18\\). This tells us that it is impossible to find a pair \\((x,y)\\) which satisfies both equations; in other words, the system has no solution. Graphically, the lines \\(6x+3y=9\\) and \\(4x+2y=12\\) are distinct and parallel, so they do not intersect.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\n\\lim_{x \\to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWhile theorem 2.3.6 is very helpful, we need a bit more to work easily with limits. Since the theorem applies when some limits are already known, we need to know the behavior of some functions that cannot themselves be constructed from the simple arithmetic operations of the theorem, such as \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Also, there is one other extraordinarily useful way to put functions together: composition. If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are functions, we can form two functions by composition: \\(f(g(x))\\) and \\(g(f(x))\\). For example, if \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}+5\\), then \\(f(g(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}+5}\\) and \\(g(f(x))=(\\sqrt{x})^{2}+5=x+5\\). Here is a companion to theorem 2.3.6 for composition:\n**Theorem 2.3.9**: Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=f(L)\\). Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a}f(g(x))=f(L).\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nNote the special form of the condition on \\(f\\): it is not enough to know that \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=M\\), though it is a bit tricky to see why. Many of the most familiar functions do have this property, and this theorem can therefore be applied. For example:\n**Theorem 2.3.10**: Suppose that \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a}\\sqrt[n]{x}=\\sqrt[n]{a},\\]\nprovided that \\(a\\) is positive if \\(n\\) is even.\nThis theorem is not too difficult to prove from the definition of limit.\nAnother of the most common algebraic tricks was used in section 2.1. Here's another example:\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.11**  Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1}\\).\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1} =\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}+2}{\\sqrt{x+ 5}+2}\\] \\[=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{x+5-4}{(x+1)(\\sqrt{x+5}+2)}\\] \\[=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{x+1}{(x+1)(\\sqrt{x+5}+2)}\\] \\[=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+5}+2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\]\nAt the very last step we have used theorems 2.3.9 and 2.3.10. \\(\\Box\\)\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nUsually \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the left\" and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the right\".\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.13**  Discuss \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\).\nThe function \\(f(x)=x/|x|\\) is undefined at 0; when \\(x>0\\), \\(|x|=x\\) and so \\(f(x)=1\\); when \\(x<0\\), \\(|x|=-x\\) and \\(f(x)=-1\\). Thus \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}-1=-1\\) while\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}1=1\\). The limit of \\(f(x)\\) must be equal to both the left and right limits; since they are different, the limit \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\) does not exist. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 2.3.\nCompute the limits.

Let's do a little work with the definition again:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}a^{x} =\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{a^{x+\\Delta x}-a^{x}}{\\Delta x}\\] \\[=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{a^{x}a^{\\Delta x}-a^{x}}{\\Delta x}\\] \\[=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}a^{x}\\frac{a^{\\Delta x}-1}{\\Delta x}\\] \\[=a^{x}\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{a^{\\Delta x}-1}{\\Delta x}\\]\n### Derivatives of the exponential and logarithmic functions\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{e^{\\Delta x}-1\\over\\Delta x}=1.\\]\nAs you might guess from our two examples, \\(e\\) is closer to 3 than to 2, and in fact \\(e\\approx 2.718\\).\nNow we see that the function \\(e^{x}\\) has a truly remarkable property:\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}e^{x}&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{e^{x+\\Delta x}-e^{x}\\over \\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{e^{x}e^{\\Delta x}-e^{x}\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}e^{x}{e^{\\Delta x}-1\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=e^{x}\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{e^{ \\Delta x}-1\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=e^{x}\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{e^{\\Delta x}-1\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=e^{x}\\cr}\\]\nThat is, \\(e^{x}\\) is its own derivative, or in other words the slope of \\(e^{x}\\) is the same as its height, or the same as its second coordinate: The function \\(f(x)=e^{x}\\) goes through the point \\((z,e^{z})\\) and has slope \\(e^{z}\\) there, no matter what \\(z\\) is. It is sometimes convenient to express the function \\(e^{x}\\) without an exponent, since complicated exponents can be hard to read. In such cases we use \\(\\exp(x)\\), e.g., \\(\\exp(1+x^{2})\\) instead of \\(e^{1+x^{2}}\\).\n\n\n",

If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nOther physical systems that oscillate can also be described by such differential equations. Some electric circuits, for example, generate oscillating current.\n##### Example 17.5.4\nFind the solution to the intial value problem \\(\\ddot{y}-4\\dot{y}+4y=0\\), \\(y(0)=-3\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=1\\). The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}-4x+4=(x-2)^{2}\\), so there\nis one root, \\(r=2\\), and the general solution is \\(Ae^{2t}+Bte^{2t}\\). Substituting \\(t=0\\) we get \\(-3=A+0=A\\).

Rewrite the following as algebraic expressions of \\(x\\) and state the domain on which the equivalence is valid. 1. \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))\\) 2. \\(\\cos(\\operatorname{arccot}(2x))\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. 1. We know \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\\) is the real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\tan(t)=\\sqrt{3}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), so \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The real number \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})\\) lies in the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\sqrt{3}\\). We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\). 3. We can apply Theorem 10.27 directly and obtain \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=-5\\). However, working it through provides us with yet another opportunity to understand why this is the case. Letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-5)\\), we have that \\(t\\) belongs to the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). 4. We start simplifying \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)\\) by letting \\(t=\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\). Then \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\) for some \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Since \\(\\tan(t)<0\\), we know, in fact, \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\). One way to proceed is to use The Pythagorean Identity, \\(1+\\operatorname{cot}^{2}(t)=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\), since this relates the reciprocals of \\(\\tan(t)\\) and \\(\\sin(t)\\) and is valid for all \\(t\\) under consideration.4 From \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\), we get \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\frac{4}{3}\\). Substituting, we get \\(1+\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2}=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\) so that \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=\\pm\\frac{5}{3}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\), we choose \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), so \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). 2. 1. If we let \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\), then \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\tan(t)=x\\). We look for a way to express \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Before we get started using identities, we note that \\(\\tan(2t)\\) is undefined when \\(2t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 tells us we need to exclude values of \\(t\\) where \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. The only members of this family which lie in \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) are \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), which means the values of \\(t\\) under consideration are \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\cup\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{ 4}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Returning to \\(\\arctan(2t)\\), we note the double angle identity \\(\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}\\), is valid for all the values of \\(t\\) under consideration, hence we get \\[\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\]\nTo find where this equivalence is valid we check back with our substitution \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\). Since the domain of \\(\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only exclusions come from the values of \\(t\\) we discarded earlier, \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Since \\(x=\\tan(t)\\), this means we exclude \\(x=\\tan\\left(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\pm 1\\). Hence, the equivalence \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\) holds for all \\(x\\) in \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\). 2. To get started, we let \\(t=\\arccot(2x)\\) so that \\(\\cot(t)=2x\\) where \\(0<t<\\pi\\). In terms of \\(t\\), \\(\\cos(\\arccot(2x))=\\cos(t)\\), and our goal is to express the latter in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(\\cos(t)\\) is always defined, there are no additional restrictions on \\(t\\), so we can begin using identities to relate \\(\\cot(t)\\) to \\(\\cos(t)\\). The identity \\(\\cot(t)=\\frac{\\cos(t)}{\\sin(t)}\\) is valid for \\(t\\) in \\((0,\\pi)\\), so our strategy is to obtain \\(\\sin(t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\), then write \\(\\cos(t)=\\cot(t)\\sin(t)\\). The identity \\(1+\\cot^{2}(t)=\\csc^{2}(t)\\) holds for all \\(t\\) in \\((0,\\pi)\\) and relates \\(\\cot(t)\\) and \\(\\csc(t)=\\frac{1}{\\sin(t)}\\). Substituting \\(\\cot(t)=2x\\), we get \\(1+(2x)^{2}=\\csc^{2}(t)\\), or \\(\\csc(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}\\). Since \\(t\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\csc(t)>0\\), so \\(\\csc(t)=\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}\\) which gives \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}}\\). Hence, \\[\\cos(\\arccot(2x))=\\cos(t)=\\cot(t)\\sin(t)=\\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}}\\] Since \\(\\arccot(2x)\\) is defined for all real numbers \\(x\\) and we encountered no additional restrictions on \\(t\\), we have \\(\\cos\\left(\\arccot(2x)\\right)=\\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}}\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\).\nThe last two functions to invert are secant and cosecant.

In other words, we are generally going to want to figure out what a quantity \"approaches\" in situations where we can't merely plug in a value. If you would like to think about a hard example (which we will analyze later) consider what happens to \\((\\sin x)/x\\) as \\(x\\) approaches zero.

In this case it is possible to compute the actual value \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to a high precision to answer the question. But since in general we won't be able to do that, let's not. We might start by computing \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) for values of \\(x\\) close to 2, as we did in the previous sections. Here are some values: \\(\\sqrt{2.05}=1.431782106\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.04}=1.428285686\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.03}=1.424780685\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.02}=1.421267040\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.01}=1.417744688\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.005}=1.415980226\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.004}=1.415627070\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.003}=1.415273825\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.002}=1.414920492\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.001}=1.414567072\\). So it looks at least possible that indeed these values \"approach\" 1.41--already \\(\\sqrt{2.001}\\) is quite close. If we continue this process, however, at some point we will appear to \"stall.\" In fact, \\(\\sqrt{2}=1.414213562\\ldots\\), so we will never even get as far as 1.4142, no matter how long we continue the sequence. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo in a fuzzy, everyday sort of sense, it is true that \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) \"gets close to\" 1.41, but it does not \"approach\" 1.41 in the sense we want. To compute an exact slope or an exact velocity, what we want to know is that a given quantity becomes \"arbitrarily close\" to a fixed value, meaning that the first quantity can be made \"as close as we like\" to the fixed value. Consider again the quantities\n\\[{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}\\over\\Delta x}=-19.6-4.9\\Delta x.\\]\nThese two quantities are equal as long as \\(\\Delta x\\) is not zero; if \\(\\Delta x\\) is zero, the left hand quantity is meaningless, while the right hand one is \\(-19.6\\). Can we say more than we did before about why the right hand side \"approaches\" \\(-19.6\\), in the desired sense? Can we really make it \"as close as we want\" to \\(-19.6\\)? Let's try a test case. Can we make \\(-19.6-4.9\\Delta x\\) within one millionth (\\(0.000001\\)) of \\(-19.6\\)? The values within a millionth of \\(-19.6\\) are those in the interval \\((-19.600001,-19.599999)\\). As \\(\\Delta x\\) approaches zero, does \\(-19.6-4.9\\Delta x\\) eventually reside inside this interval? If \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive, this would require\nthat \\(-19.6-4.9\\Delta x>-19.600001\\). This is something we can manipulate with a little algebra:\n\\[-19.6-4.9\\Delta x>-19.600001\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFigure 8.6.3: A parabola (dashed) approximating a curve (solid). (AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\n\n",

If we take a step back and think of these families of solutions geometrically, we see we are finding the measures of all angles with a reference angle of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). As a result, these solutions can be combined and we may write our solutions as \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of solutions, we note that, depending on the integer \\(k\\), \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right)\\) doesn't always equal \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\). However, it is true that for all integers \\(k\\), \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right)=\\pm\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\pm 2\\). (Can you show this?) As a result, \\[\\sec^{2}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right) = \\left(\\pm\\sec\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\] \\[= (\\pm 2)^{2}\\] \\[= 4\\] The same holds for the family \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\). The solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) come from the values \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\), namely \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). To confirm graphically, we use\na reciprocal identity to rewrite the secant as cosine. The \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=4\\) verify our answers. \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=0}\\)\\(y=\\frac{1}{\\cos^{2}(x)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=4}\\)\n5. The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check, we note \\[\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of tangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= -3\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2})}\\] To determine which of our answers lie in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we first need to get an idea of the value of \\(2\\arctan(-3)\\). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\). Since this is outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we discard \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\) and all solutions of the form \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for \\(k>2\\). Graphically, we see \\(y=\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\) and \\(y=-3\\) intersect only once on \\([0,2\\pi)\\) at \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\approx 3.7851\\). Footnote 5: Your instructor will let you know if you should abandon the analytic route at this point and use your calculator. But seriously, what fun would that be?\n6. To solve \\(\\sin(2x)=0.87\\), we first note that it has the form \\(\\sin(u)=0.87\\), which has the family of solutions \\(u=\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\pi-\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of sine here is \\(2x\\), we get \\(2x=\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\pi-\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check,\n\\[\\sin\\left(2\\left[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\sin\\left(\\arcsin(0.87)\\right)\\qquad\\qquad\\text{(the period of sine is $2\\pi$)}\\] \\[= 0.87\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2.2})}\\]\nFor the family \\(x=\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) , we get\n\n\n",

Theorem 10.3 tells us that \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{a}{c}\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{b}{c}\\), so we have determined the cosine and sine of \\(\\theta\\) in terms of the lengths of the sides of the right triangle. Thus we have the following theorem.\n**Theorem 10.4.** Suppose \\(\\theta\\) is an acute angle residing in a right triangle. If the length of the side adjacent to \\(\\theta\\) is \\(a\\), the length of the side opposite \\(\\theta\\) is \\(b\\), and the length of the hypotenuse is \\(c\\), then \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{a}{c}\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{b}{c}\\).\n**Example 10.2.8.** Find the measure of the missing angle and the lengths of the missing sides of:\n**Solution.** The first and easiest task is to find the measure of the missing angle. Since the sum of angles of a triangle is \\(180^{\\circ}\\), we know that the missing angle has measure \\(180^{\\circ}-30^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}=60^{\\circ}\\). We now proceed to find the lengths of the remaining two sides of the triangle. Let \\(c\\) denote the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. By Theorem 10.4, we have \\(\\cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)=\\frac{7}{c}\\), or \\(c=\\frac{7}{\\cos(30^{\\circ})}\\). Since \\(\\cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), we have, after the usual fraction gymnastics, \\(c=\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). At this point, we have two ways to proceed to find the length of the side opposite the \\(30^{\\circ}\\) angle, which we'll denote \\(b\\). We know the length of the adjacent side is \\(7\\) and the length of the hypotenuse is \\(\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), so we\ncould use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side and solve \\((7)^{2}+b^{2}=\\left(\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^{2}\\) for \\(b\\). Alternatively, we could use Theorem 10.4, namely that \\(\\sin{(30^{\\circ})}=\\frac{b}{c}\\).

We can make progress with specific kinds of first order differential equations. For example, much can be said about equations of the form where is a function of the two variables and . Under reasonable conditions on , such an equation has a solution and the corresponding initial value problem has a unique solution. However, in general, these equations can be very difficult or impossible to solve explicitly.\nExample 17.1.6 Consider this specific example of an initial value problem for Newton's law of cooling: , . We first note that if , the right hand side of the differential equation is zero, and so the constant function is a solution to the differential equation. It is not a solution to the initial value problem, since . (The physical interpretation of this constant solution is that if a liquid is at the same temperature as its surroundings, then the liquid will stay at that temperature.)\n### First Order Differential Equations\nSo long as \\(y\\) is not 25, we can rewrite the differential equation as\n\\[\\eqalign{{dy\\over dt}{1\\over 25-y}&=2\\cr{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=2\\,dt,}\\]\nso\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy=\\int 2\\,dt,\\]\nthat is, the two anti-derivatives must be the same except for a constant difference. We can calculate these anti-derivatives and rearrange the results:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\nAs before, all solutions are represented by \\(y=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}\\), allowing \\(A\\) to be zero. \\(\\Box\\)\n**DEFINITION 17.1.8**: A first order differential equation is **separable** if it can be written in the form \\(\\dot{y}=f(t)g(y)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nAs in the examples, we can attempt to solve a separable equation by converting to the form\n\\[\\int{1\\over g(y)}\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nThis technique is called **separation of variables**. The simplest (in principle) sort of separable equation is one in which \\(g(y)=1\\), in which case we attempt to solve\n\\[\\int 1\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nWe can do this if we can find an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)\\).\n\n\n",

For the vectors \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), find the following. 1. \\(\\hat{v}\\) (b) \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) (c) \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\) (d) \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. We are told that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\) and are given information about its direction, so we can use the formula \\(\\vec{v}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v}\\) to get the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\). To determine \\(\\hat{v}\\), we appeal to Definition 11.8. We are told that \\(\\vec{v}\\) lies in Quadrant II and makes a \\(60^{\\circ}\\) angle with the negative \\(x\\)-axis, so the polar form of the terminal point of \\(\\vec{v}\\), when plotted in standard position is \\((5,120^{\\circ})\\). (See the diagram below.) Thus \\(\\hat{v}=\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(120^{\\circ}\\right),\\sin\\left(120^{\\circ}\\right) \\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right\\rangle\\), so \\(\\vec{v}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v}=5\\left\\langle-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle-\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right\\rangle\\).\n2. For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=6\\). In light of Definition 11.8, we can find the \\(\\theta\\) we're after by converting the point with rectangular coordinates \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) to polar form \\((r,\\theta)\\) where \\(r=\\|\\vec{v}\\|>0\\). From Section 11.4, we have \\(\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{-3\\sqrt{3}}{3}=-\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) is a point in Quadrant IV, \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant IV angle. Hence, we pick \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). We may check our answer by verifying \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle=6\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3 }\\right),\\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\).\n3. 1. Since we are given the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\), we'll use the formula \\(\\hat{v}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\right)\\vec{v}\\). For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\), we have \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\hat{v}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). 2. We know from our work above that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\), so to find \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\), we need only find \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|=5-2\\sqrt{5}\\). 3. In the expression \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\), notice that the arithmetic on the vectors comes first, then the magnitude. Hence, our first step is to find the component form of the vector \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\). We get \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle-2\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|=\\|\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{65}\\). 4. To find \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\), we first need \\(\\hat{w}\\). Using the formula \\(\\hat{w}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\vec{w}\\) along with \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{5}\\), which we found the in the previous problem, we get \\(\\hat{w}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{5}},-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5},- \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{ 5}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{25}+\\frac{20}{25}}=\\sqrt{1}=1\\).\nThe process exemplified by number 1 in Example 11.8.4 above by which we take information about the magnitude and direction of a vector and find the component form of a vector is called **resolving** a vector into its components. As an application of this process, we revisit Example 11.8.1 below.\n**Example 11.8.5**.: A plane leaves an airport with an airspeed of 175 miles per hour with bearing N40\\({}^{\\circ}\\)E. A 35 mile per hour wind is blowing at a bearing of S60\\({}^{\\circ}\\)E. Find the true speed of the plane, rounded to the nearest mile per hour, and the true bearing of the plane, rounded to the nearest degree.\n**Solution:** We proceed as we did in Example 11.8.1 and let \\(\\vec{v}\\) denote the plane's velocity and \\(\\vec{w}\\) denote the wind's velocity, and set about determining \\(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w}\\). If we regard the airport as being\nat the origin, the positive \\(y\\)-axis acting as due north and the positive \\(x\\)-axis acting as due east, we see that the vectors \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are in standard position and their directions correspond to the angles \\(50^{\\circ}\\) and \\(-30^{\\circ}\\), respectively. Hence, the component form of \\(\\vec{v}=175\\left\\langle\\cos(50^{\\circ}),\\sin(50^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle 1 75\\cos(50^{\\circ}),175\\sin(50^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle\\) and the component form of \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 35\\cos(-30^{\\circ}),35\\sin(-30^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle\\). Since we have no convenient way to express the exact values of cosine and sine of \\(50^{\\circ}\\), we leave both vectors in terms of cosines and sines.13 Adding corresponding components, we find the resultant vector \\(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 175\\cos(50^{\\circ})+35\\cos(-30^{\\circ}),175\\sin(5 0^{\\circ})+35\\sin(-30^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle\\). To find the 'true' speed of the plane, we compute the magnitude of this resultant vector\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe Law of Cosines yields \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w} \\|\\cos(\\theta)\\). From Example 11.9.1, we know \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\). Equating these two expressions for \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\) gives \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=\\|\\vec{v} \\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\) which reduces to \\(-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})\\), or \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\), as required. An immediate consequence of Theorem 11.23 is the following.\n**Theorem 11.24**.: Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors and let \\(\\theta\\) the angle between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\). Then\n\\[\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right) =\\arccos(\\hat{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\]\nWe obtain the formula in Theorem 11.24 by solving the equation given in Theorem 11.23 for \\(\\theta\\). Since \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero, so are \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Hence, we may divide both sides of \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\) by \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) to get \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\). Since \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) by definition, the values of \\(\\theta\\) exactly match the range of the arccosine function. Hence, \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\). Using Theorem 11.22, we can rewrite \\(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\| }\\vec{v}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\vec{w}\\right)=\\hat{v}\\cdot \\hat{w}\\), giving us the alternative formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos(\\hat{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\).\nWe are overdue for an example.\n**Example 11.9.2**.: Find the angle between the following pairs of vectors.\n1. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle-\\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle\\)\n2. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\)\n3. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,1\\right\\rangle\\)\n**Solution.** We use the formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\) from Theorem 11.24 in each case below.\n1. We have \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle- \\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle=-3\\sqrt{3}-3\\sqrt{3}=-6\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=\\sqrt{36}=6\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{3})^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{4}=2\\), \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-6\\sqrt{3}}{12}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}} {2}\\right)=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\).\n2. For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\), we find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle =10-10=0\\). Hence, it doesn't matter what \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) are,2\\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|} \\right)=\\arccos(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Footnote 2: Note that there is no ‘zero product property’ for the dot product since neither \\(\\vec{v}\\) nor \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\vec{0}\\), yet \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\n3. We find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 2,1 \\right\\rangle=6-4=2\\). Also \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{5\\sqrt{5}}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2 5}\\right)\\). Since \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\) isn't the cosine of one of the common angles, we leave our answer as \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\right)\\).\nThe vectors \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\) in Example 11.9.2 are called **orthogonal** and we write \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\), because the angle between them is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians \\(=90^{\\circ}\\). Geometrically, when orthogonal vectors are sketched with the same initial point, the lines containing the vectors are perpendicular.\nWe state the relationship between orthogonal vectors and their dot product in the following theorem.\n**Theorem 11.25**.: **The Dot Product Detects Orthogonality:** Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors. Then \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\) if and only if \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\nTo prove Theorem 11.25, we first assume \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero vectors with \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\). By definition, the angle between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). By Theorem 11.23, \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). Conversely, if \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero vectors and \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\), then Theorem 11.24 gives \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)= \\arccos\\left(\\frac{0}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)=\\arccos(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\). We can use Theorem 11.25 in the following example to provide a different proof about the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines.3\nFootnote 3: See Exercise 2.1.1 in Section 2.1.\n**Example 11.9.3**.: Let \\(L_{1}\\) be the line \\(y=m_{1}x+b_{1}\\) and let \\(L_{2}\\) be the line \\(y=m_{2}x+b_{2}\\). Prove that \\(L_{1}\\) is perpendicular to \\(L_{2}\\) if and only if \\(m_{1}\\cdot m_{2}=-1\\).\n**Solution.** Our strategy is to find two vectors: \\(\\vec{v_{1}}\\), which has the same direction as \\(L_{1}\\), and \\(\\vec{v_{2}}\\), which has the same direction as \\(L_{2}\\) and show \\(\\vec{v_{1}}\\perp\\vec{v_{2}}\\) if and only if \\(m_{1}m_{2}=-1\\). To that end, we substitute \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1\\) into \\(y=m_{1}x+b_{1}\\) to find two points which lie on \\(L_{1}\\), namely \\(P(0,b_{1})\\)\n\n\n",
