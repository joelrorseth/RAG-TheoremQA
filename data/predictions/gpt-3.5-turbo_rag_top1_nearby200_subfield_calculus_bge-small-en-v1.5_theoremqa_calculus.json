For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\).

When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem.

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n",

Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\). When we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+3)}{\\ln(2)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln(6-x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\), we find they intersect at \\(x=5\\).\n6. Starting with \\(1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\), we gather the logs to one side to get the equation \\(1=2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\). Before we can combine the logarithms, however, we need a common base. Since 4 is a power of 2, we use change of base to convert \\[\\log_{4}(x+1)=\\frac{\\log_{2}(x+1)}{\\log_{2}(4)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Hence, our original equation becomes \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\right)\\] \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Power Rule \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}\\right)\\] Quotient Rule Rewriting this in exponential form, we get \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}=2\\) or \\(x^{2}-2x-2=0\\).

Graphing \\(f(x)=1+\\frac{2\\ln(x+1)}{\\ln(4)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\), we see the graphs intersect only at \\(x=1+\\sqrt{3}\\approx 2.732\\).

What is the limit of $g(x)/x$ as $x$ goes to infinity?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\nwe don't have to worry about it ever again. When we say that \\(x\\) might be \"complicated\" we really mean that in practice it might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:\n**Theorem 2.3.5** Suppose \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\). Then\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\n_Proof._ We have to use the official definition of limit to make sense of this. So given any \\(\\epsilon\\) we need to find a \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|f(x)g(x)-LM|<\\epsilon\\). What do we have to work with? We know that we can make \\(f(x)\\) close to \\(L\\) and \\(g(x)\\) close to \\(M\\), and we have to somehow connect these facts to make \\(f(x)g(x)\\) close to \\(LM\\).\nWe use, as is so often the case, a little algebraic trick:\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&=|f(x)g(x)-f(x)M+f(x)M-LM|\\cr&=|f(x)(g(x)-M)+(f(x)-L)M| \\cr&\\leq|f(x)(g(x)-M)|+|(f(x)-L)M|\\cr&=|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|.\\cr}\\]\nThis is all straightforward except perhaps for the \"\\(\\leq\\)\". That is an example of the **triangle inequality**, which says that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers then \\(|a+b|\\leq|a|+|b|\\). If you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.\n\n\n",

First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense.

We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well.

What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\).

By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function.

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\n\n",

(Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse.

If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations.

The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\n\n",

This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\).

The relation \\(R\\) consists of all points \\((x,y)\\) whose \\(y\\)-coordinate is greater than \\(|x|\\). If we graph \\(y=|x|\\), then we want all of the points in the plane _above_ the points on the graph. Dotting the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) as we have done before to indicate that the points on the graph itself are not in the relation, we get the shaded region below on the left.\n2. For a point to be in \\(S\\), its \\(y\\)-coordinate must be less than or equal to the \\(y\\)-coordinate on the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). This is the set of all points _below_ or _on_ the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n3. Finally, the relation \\(T\\) takes the points whose \\(y\\)-coordinates satisfy both the conditions given in \\(R\\) and those of \\(S\\).

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\n\n",

If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\n\n",

We find \\(N(0)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{0}}=\\frac{84}{2800}=\\frac{3}{100}\\). Since \\(N(t)\\) measures the number of people who have heard the rumor in hundreds, \\(N(0)\\) corresponds to 3 people. Since \\(t=0\\) corresponds to April 1, 2009, we may conclude that on that day, 3 people have heard the rumor.14 Footnote 14: Or, more likely, three people started the rumor. I’d wager Jeff, Jamie, and Jason started it. So much for telling your best friends something in confidence!\n2. We could simply note that \\(N(t)\\) is written in the form of Equation 6.7, and identify \\(L=84\\). However, to see why the answer is 84, we proceed analytically. Since the domain of \\(N\\) is restricted to \\(t\\geq 0\\), the only end behavior of significance is \\(t\\to\\infty\\). As we've seen before,15 as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), we have \\(1997e^{-t}\\to 0^{+}\\) and so \\(N(t)\\approx\\frac{84}{1+\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx 84\\). Hence, as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(N(t)\\to 84\\). This means that as time goes by, the number of people who will have heard the rumor approaches 8400. Footnote 15: See, for example, Example 6.1.2.\n3. To find how long it takes until 4200 people have heard the rumor, we set \\(N(t)=42\\). Solving \\(\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-t}}=42\\) gives \\(t=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\). It takes around 8 days until 4200 people have heard the rumor.\n4. We graph \\(y=N(x)\\) using the calculator and see that the line \\(y=84\\) is the horizontal asymptote of the graph, confirming our answer to part 2, and the graph intersects the line \\(y=42\\) at \\(x=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\), which confirms our answer to part 3.\n\n\n",

In both cases we started with the Pythagorean Theorem and took derivatives on both sides.

But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\).

Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\n\n",

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges.

To find the domain and range of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\), we note that since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x\\) is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers. To determine the range of \\(f\\), we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7. Choosing our 'key' point to be \\((0,0)\\) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we find that the graph of \\(y=f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) differs from the graph of \\(y=F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) by a horizontal compression by a factor of \\(4\\) and a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\). It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of \\(\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We confirm our findings on the calculator below. 3. To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\nHence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(g(x)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi\\). What about \\(x=0\\)? We know \\(g(0)=\\operatorname{arccot}(0)+\\pi=\\pi\\), and neither of the formulas for \\(g\\) involving arctangent will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph \\(y=g(x)\\) on our calculators, we need to write it as a piecewise defined function:\n\n\n",

The solutions to \\(\\cos(u)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) are \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\n\n",

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\n\n",

In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n\n\n",

We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\).

Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions.

Figure 17.4.4 shows a slope field for this equation\nthat is quite informative. It is apparent that if the initial population is smaller than \\(M\\) it rises to \\(M\\) over the long term, while if the initial population is greater than \\(M\\) it decreases to \\(M\\). It is quite easy to generate slope fields with Sage; follow the AP link in the figure caption.\n##### Exercises 17.4\nIn problems 1-4, compute the Euler approximations for the initial value problem for \\(0\\leq t\\leq 1\\) and \\(\\Delta t=0.2\\).

Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\). The quantity \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\) is usually denoted\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|=|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\]\nand called the **Jacobian**. Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant\n\\[\\left|\\matrix{f_{u}&g_{u}\\cr f_{v}&g_{v}\\cr}\\right|,\\]\nwhich may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\n\n\n",

The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\). This point is on the upper hemisphere, so we use \\(f(x,y)=\\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\). Then \\(f_{x}(x,y)=-x(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\) and \\(f_{y}(x,y)=-y(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\), so \\(f_{x}(1,1)=f_{y}(1,1)=-1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and the equation of the plane is\n\\[z=-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(x-1)-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(y-1)+\\sqrt{2}.\\]\nThe hemisphere and this tangent plane are pictured in figure 14.3.3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it appears that to find a tangent plane, we need only find two quite simple ordinary derivatives, namely \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\). This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n\n\n",

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\n\n",

First we compute the mass:\n\\[M=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}1\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\cos x \\,dx=\\left.\\sin x\\right|_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}=2.\\]\nNext,\n\\[M_{x}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}y\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^{2}x\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]\nFinally,\n\\[M_{y}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}x\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}x\\cos x \\,dx=0.\\]\nSo \\(\\bar{x}=0\\) as expected, and \\(\\bar{y}=\\pi/4/2=\\pi/8\\). This is the same problem as in example 9.6.4; it may be helpful to compare the two solutions. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 15.3.2**: Find the center of mass of a two-dimensional plate that occupies the quarter circle \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\) in the first quadrant and has density \\(k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\). It seems clear that because of the symmetry of both the region and the density function (both are important!), \\(\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}\\). We'll do both to check our work.\nJumping right in:\n\\[M=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\,dy\\,dx=k\\int_{0}^{1}x^{ 2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\\frac{(1-x^{2})^{3/2}}{3}\\,dx.\\]\nThis integral is something we can do, but it's a bit unpleasant. Since everything in sight is related to a circle, let's back up and try polar coordinates.

Next, since \\(y=r\\sin\\theta\\),\n\\[M_{x}=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}r^{4}\\sin\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{ \\pi/2}\\left.\\frac{1}{5}\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta=k\\,-\\frac{1}{5}\\cos\\theta\\right|_{0 }^{\\pi/2}=\\frac{k}{5}.\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[M_{y}=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}r^{4}\\cos\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{ \\pi/2}\\left.\\frac{1}{5}\\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta=k\\,\\left.\\frac{1}{5}\\sin\\theta \\right|_{0}^{\\pi/2}=\\frac{k}{5}.\\]\nFinally, \\(\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}=\\frac{8}{5\\pi}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Exercises 15.3**:\n1.

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n\n\n",

If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult but also more general.\nWe start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at \\(t=0\\) the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, \\(t=1\\)? We know that the speed of the object at time \\(t=0\\) is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when \\(t=1\\). In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at \\(t=1\\), but certainly we can do better. Let's look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object\nat each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from \\(t=0.1\\) to \\(t=0.2\\), we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at \\(t=0.1\\). In this case the object would travel \\((0.3)(0.1)=0.03\\) centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between \\(t=0.2\\) and \\(t=0.3\\) the object would travel \\((0.6)(0.1)=0.06\\) centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object travels\n\n\n",

If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=6\\). In light of Definition 11.8, we can find the \\(\\theta\\) we're after by converting the point with rectangular coordinates \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) to polar form \\((r,\\theta)\\) where \\(r=\\|\\vec{v}\\|>0\\). From Section 11.4, we have \\(\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{-3\\sqrt{3}}{3}=-\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) is a point in Quadrant IV, \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant IV angle. Hence, we pick \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). We may check our answer by verifying \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle=6\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3 }\\right),\\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\).\n3. 1. Since we are given the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\), we'll use the formula \\(\\hat{v}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\right)\\vec{v}\\). For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\), we have \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\hat{v}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). 2. We know from our work above that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\), so to find \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\), we need only find \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|=5-2\\sqrt{5}\\). 3. In the expression \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\), notice that the arithmetic on the vectors comes first, then the magnitude. Hence, our first step is to find the component form of the vector \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\). We get \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle-2\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|=\\|\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{65}\\). 4. To find \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\), we first need \\(\\hat{w}\\). Using the formula \\(\\hat{w}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\vec{w}\\) along with \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{5}\\), which we found the in the previous problem, we get \\(\\hat{w}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{5}},-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5},- \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{ 5}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{25}+\\frac{20}{25}}=\\sqrt{1}=1\\).\nThe process exemplified by number 1 in Example 11.8.4 above by which we take information about the magnitude and direction of a vector and find the component form of a vector is called **resolving** a vector into its components. As an application of this process, we revisit Example 11.8.1 below.\n\n\n",
