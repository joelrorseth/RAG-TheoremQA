It's about time for an example.\n**Example 10.6.1**.:\n1. Find the exact values of the following. 1. \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) 2. \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) 3. \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) 4. \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) 5. \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\\) 6. \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\\) 7. \\(\\cos\\left(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)\\) 8. \\(\\sin\\left(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right)\\)\n2. Rewrite the following as algebraic expressions of \\(x\\) and state the domain on which the equivalence is valid. 1. \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\) 2. \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. 1. To find \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), we need to find the real number \\(t\\) (or, equivalently, an angle measuring \\(t\\) radians) which lies between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). We know \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) meets these criteria, so \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The value of \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) is a real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). The number we seek is \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Hence, \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). 3. The number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\) lies in the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Our answer is \\(\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\). 4. To find \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), we seek the number \\(t\\) in the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). The answer is \\(t=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) so that \\(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). 5. Since \\(0\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\leq\\pi\\), we could simply invoke Theorem 10.26 to get \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). However, in order to make sure we understand _why_ this is the case, we choose to work the example through using the definition of arccosine. Working from the inside out, \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3 }}{2}\\right)\\). Now, \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\) is the real number \\(t\\) with \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\) and \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), so that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\n\n",

It requires more computation and more theorems than the alternative.4 In general, no matter how many theorems you throw at a polynomial, it may well be impossible5 to find their zeros exactly. The polynomial \\(f(x)=x^{5}-x-1\\) is one such beast.6 According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, \\(f\\) has exactly one positive real zero, and it could have two negative real zeros, or none at all. The Rational Zeros\nTest gives us \\(\\pm 1\\) as rational zeros to try but neither of these work since \\(f(1)=f(-1)=-1\\). If we try the substitution technique we used in Example 3.3.4, we find \\(f(x)\\) has three terms, but the exponent on the \\(x^{5}\\) isn't exactly twice the exponent on \\(x\\). How could we go about approximating the positive zero without resorting to the 'Zero' command of a graphing calculator? We use the **Bisection Method**. The first step in the Bisection Method is to find an interval on which \\(f\\) changes sign. We know \\(f(1)=-1\\) and we find \\(f(2)=29\\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, we know that the zero of \\(f\\) lies in the interval \\([1,2]\\). Next, we 'bisect' this interval and find the midpoint is \\(1.5\\). We have that \\(f(1.5)\\approx 5.09\\). This means that our zero is between \\(1\\) and \\(1.5\\), since \\(f\\) changes sign on this interval. Now, we 'bisect' the interval \\([1,1.5]\\) and find \\(f(1.25)\\approx 0.80\\), so now we have the zero between \\(1\\) and \\(1.25\\). Bisecting \\([1,1.25]\\), we find \\(f(1.125)\\approx-0.32\\), which means the zero of \\(f\\) is between \\(1.125\\) and \\(1.25\\). We continue in this fashion until we have 'sandwiched' the zero between two numbers which differ by no more than a desired accuracy. You can think of the Bisection Method as reversing the sign diagram process: instead of finding the zeros and checking the sign of \\(f\\) using test values, we are using test values to determine where the signs switch to find the zeros. It is a slow and tedious, yet fool-proof, method for approximating a real zero.\n\n\n",

The last equation we are asked to solve, \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), poses two immediate problems. First, we are not told whether or not \\(x\\) represents an angle or a real number. We assume the latter, but note that we will use angles and the Unit Circle to solve the equation regardless. Second, as we have mentioned, there is no universally accepted range of the arcsecant function. For that reason, we adopt the advice given in Section 10.3 and convert this to the cosine problem \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Adopting an angle approach, we consider the equation \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and note that our solutions lie in Quadrants II and III. Since \\(-\\frac{3}{5}\\) isn't the cosine of any of the 'common angles', we'll need to express our solutions in terms of the arccosine function. The real number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) is defined so that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). If we let \\(\\beta=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) radians, we see that \\(\\beta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. To obtain a Quadrant III angle solution, we may simply use \\(-\\beta=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\). Since all angle solutions are coterminal with \\(\\beta\\) or \\(-\\beta\\), we get our solutions to \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) to be \\(\\theta=\\beta+2\\pi k=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=-\\beta+2\\pi k=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Switching back to the variable \\(x\\), we record our final answer to \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\) as \\(x=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\n\n\n",

We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well.

It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example.

And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\n\n",

To graph \\(y=T(t)\\) using transformations, we start with the basic function, \\(f(t)=e^{t}\\). As we have already remarked, \\(e\\approx 2.718>1\\) so the graph of \\(f\\) is an increasing exponential with \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,1)\\) and horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\). The points \\(\\left(-1,e^{-1}\\right)\\approx(-1,0.37)\\) and \\((1,e)\\approx(1,2.72)\\) are also on the graph. Since the formula \\(T(t)\\) looks rather complicated, we rewrite \\(T(t)\\) in the form presented in Theorem 1.7 and use that result to track the changes to our three points and the horizontal asymptote. We have \\[T(t)=70+90e^{-0.1t}=90e^{-0.1t}+70=90f(-0.1t)+70\\] Multiplication of the input to \\(f\\), \\(t\\), by \\(-0.1\\) results in a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(10\\) as well as a reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. We divide each of the \\(x\\) values of our points by \\(-0.1\\) (which amounts to multiplying them by \\(-10\\)) to obtain \\(\\left(10,e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((-10,e)\\). Since none of these changes affected the \\(y\\) values, the horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we see that the output from \\(f\\) is being multiplied by \\(90\\). This results in a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(90\\). We multiply the \\(y\\)-coordinates by \\(90\\) to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,90)\\), and \\((-10,90e)\\). We also multiply the \\(y\\) value of the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) by \\(90\\), and it remains \\(y=0\\). Finally, we add \\(70\\) to all of the \\(y\\)-coordinates, which shifts the graph upwards to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}+70\\right)\\approx(10,103.11)\\), \\((0,160)\\), and \\((-10,90e+70)\\approx(-10,314.64)\\). Adding \\(70\\) to the horizontal asymptote shifts it upwards as well to \\(y=70\\). We connect these three points using the same shape in the same direction as in the graph of \\(f\\) and, last but not least, we restrict the domain to match the applied domain \\([0,\\infty)\\). The result is below.\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\n\n",

No matter what the number of rolls, once we simplify the average, we get the same \\(\\sum_{i=2}^{12}iP(i)\\). While the actual average value of a large number of rolls will not be exactly 7, the average should be close to 7 when the number of rolls is large. Turning this around, if the average is not close to 7, we should suspect that the dice are not fair.\nA variable, say \\(X\\), that can take certain values, each with a corresponding probability, is called a **random variable**; in the example above, the random variable was the sum of the two dice. If the possible values for \\(X\\) are \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),...,\\(x_{n}\\), then the expected value of the random variable is \\(E(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}P(x_{i})\\). The expected value is also called the **mean**.\nWhen the number of possible values for \\(X\\) is finite, we say that \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable. In many applications of probability, the number of possible values of a random variable is very large, perhaps even infinite. To deal with the infinite case we need a different approach, and since there is a sum involved, it should not be wholly surprising that integration turns out to be a useful tool. It then turns out that even when the number of possibilities is large but finite, it is frequently easier to pretend that the number is infinite. Suppose, for example, that a dart is thrown at a dart board. Since the dart board consists of a finite number of atoms, there are in some sense only a finite number of places for the dart to land, but it is easier to explore the probabilities involved by pretending that the dart can land on any point in the usual \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane.\n\n\n",

Still, it is valuable to be able to visualize relatively simple surfaces without such aids.

So the cross-section is the \"same\" parabola as in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) and \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) planes, namely, the height is always the distance from the origin squared. This means that \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) can be formed by starting with \\(z=x^{2}\\) and rotating this curve around the \\(z\\) axis.\n\n\n",

However, we have proven that is not the case.\n6. Testing the graph of \\(y=p(x)\\) for symmetry is complicated by the fact \\(p(x)\\) is a piecewise-defined function. As always, we handle this by checking the condition for symmetry by checking it on each piece of the domain. We first consider the case when \\(x<0\\) and set about finding the correct expression for \\(p(-x)\\). Even though \\(p(x)=x+3\\) for \\(x<0\\), \\(p(-x)\\neq-x+3\\) here. The reason for this is that since \\(x<0\\), \\(-x>0\\) which means to find \\(p(-x)\\), we need to use the _other_ formula for \\(p(x)\\), namely \\(p(x)=-x+3\\). Hence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(p(-x)=-(-x)+3=x+3=p(x)\\). For \\(x\\geq 0\\), \\(p(x)=-x+3\\) and we have two cases. If \\(x>0\\), then \\(-x<0\\) so \\(p(-x)=(-x)+3=-x+3=p(x)\\). If \\(x=0\\), then \\(p(0)=3=p(-0)\\). Hence, in all cases, \\(p(-x)=p(x)\\), so \\(p\\) is even. Since \\(p(0)=3\\) but \\(p(-0)=p(0)=3\\neq-3\\), we also have \\(p\\) is not odd. While graphing \\(y=p(x)\\) is not onerous to do by hand, it is instructive to see how to enter this into our calculator.

These are in general quite complicated, but one fairly simple type is useful: the second order linear equation with constant coefficients.\n##### Example 17.5.1\nConsider the intial value problem \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-2y=0\\), \\(y(0)=5\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=0\\). We make an inspired guess: might there be a solution of the form \\(e^{rt}\\)? This seems at least plausible, since in this case \\(\\ddot{y}\\), \\(\\dot{y}\\), and \\(y\\) all involve \\(e^{rt}\\).\n**470 Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nIf such a function is a solution then\n\\[\\eqalign{r^{2}e^{rt}-re^{rt}-2e^{rt}&=0\\cr e^{rt}(r^{2}-r-2)&=0\\cr(r^{2}-r-2)&=0 \\cr(r-2)(r+1)&=0,\\cr}\\]\nso \\(r\\) is \\(2\\) or \\(-1\\). Not only are \\(f=e^{2t}\\) and \\(g=e^{-t}\\) solutions, but notice that \\(y=Af+Bg\\) is also, for any constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{(Af+Bg)^{\\prime\\prime}-(Af+Bg)^{\\prime}-2(Af+Bg)&=Af^{\\prime\\prime}+ Bg^{\\prime\\prime}-Af^{\\prime}-Bg^{\\prime}-2Af-2Bg\\cr&=A(f^{\\prime\\prime}-f^{\\prime}-2f)+ B(g^{\\prime\\prime}-g^{\\prime}-2g)\\cr&=A(0)+B(0)=0.\\cr}\\]\nCan we find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that this is a solution to the initial value problem? Let's substitute:\n\\[5=y(0)=Af(0)+Bg(0)=Ae^{0}+Be^{0}=A+B\\]\nand\n\\[0=\\dot{y}(0)=Af^{\\prime}(0)+Bg^{\\prime}(0)=A2e^{0}+B(-1)e^{0}=2A-B.\\]\nSo we need to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that make both \\(5=A+B\\) and \\(0=2A-B\\) true. This is a simple set of simultaneous equations: solve \\(B=2A\\), substitute to get \\(5=A+2A=3A\\). Then \\(A=5/3\\) and \\(B=10/3\\), and the desired solution is \\((5/3)e^{2t}+(10/3)e^{-t}\\). You now see why the initial condition in this case included both \\(y(0)\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)\\): we needed two equations in the two unknowns \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\n\n\n",

Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\n\n",

This is a bit unfortunate, since it's not really \"improper\" to do this, nor is it really \"an integral\"--it is an abbreviation for the limit of a particular sort of integral. Nevertheless, we're stuck with the term, and the operation itself is perfectly legitimate. It may at first seem odd that a finite amount of work is sufficient to lift an object to \"infinity\", but sometimes surprising things are nevertheless true, and this is such a case. If the value of an improper integral is a finite number, as in this example, we say that the integral **converges**, and if not we say that the integral **diverges**.\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\).

This may be an easier question to answer, because we have tests that apply specifically to series with non-negative terms. If \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) converges then you know that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges as well. If \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) diverges then it still may be true that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges--you will have to do more work to decide the question. Another way to think of this result is: it is (potentially) easier for \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to converge than for \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) to converge, because the latter series cannot take advantage of cancellation.\nIf \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) converges we say that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges **absolutely**; to say that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely is to say that any cancellation that happens to come along is not really needed, as the terms already get small so fast that convergence is guaranteed by that alone. If \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges but \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) does not, we say that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges **conditionally**. For example \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges absolutely, while \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\\frac{1}{n}\\) converges conditionally.\n**Example 11.6.2**: Does \\(\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin n}{n^{2}}\\) converge?\nIn example 11.5.2 we saw that \\(\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin n|}{n^{2}}\\) converges, so the given series converges absolutely.\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.6.3**: Does \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n}\\frac{3n+4}{2n^{2}+3n+5}\\) converge?\nTaking the absolute value, \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{3n+4}{2n^{2}+3n+5}\\) diverges by comparison to \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{3}{10n}\\), so if the series converges it does so conditionally. It is true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(3n+4)/(2n^{2}+3n+5)=0\\), so to apply the alternating series test we need to know whether the terms are decreasing. If we let \\(f(x)=(3x+4)/(2x^{2}+3x+5)\\) then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=-(6x^{2}+16x-3)/(2x^{2}+3x+5)^{2}\\), and it is not hard to see that this is negative for \\(x\\geq 1\\), so the series is decreasing and by the alternating series test it converges. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 11.6\nDetermine whether each series converges absolutely, converges conditionally, or diverges.\n**1.**: \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\\frac{1}{2n^{2}+3n+5}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**3.**: \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\\frac{\\ln n}{n}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**5.**: \\(\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n}\\frac{1}{\\ln n}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\n\n",

As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge.

Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms.

This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation.

Suppose we wish to find the zeros of \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x+5\\).

First, the zeros \\(1+2i\\) and \\(1-2i\\) are complex conjugates. If ever we obtain non-real zeros to a quadratic function with real coefficients, the zeros will be a complex conjugate pair. (Do you see why?) Next, we note that in Example 3.4.1, part 6, we found \\((x-[1+2i])(x-[1-2i])=x^{2}-2x+5\\). This demonstrates that the factor theorem holds even for non-real zeros, i.e, \\(x=1+2i\\) is a zero of \\(f\\), and, sure enough, \\((x-[1+2i])\\) is a factor of \\(f(x)\\). It turns out that polynomial division works the same way for all complex numbers, real and non-real alike, so the Factor and Remainder Theorems hold as well.

We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\n\n\n",

Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from exercise 13 in section 17.1, \\(\\dot{y}=ky(M-y)\\): \\(y\\) is a population at time \\(t\\), \\(M\\) is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and \\(k\\) measures the reproduction rate of the population.

Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\). So the question becomes: what happens between \\(-2\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\)? Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than \\(4\\cdot 4\\) which is clearly larger than \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), this settles the question.)\n\n\n",

Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\n\n",

We first note that the independent variable here is \\(t\\), chosen because it represents time. Secondly, the function is broken up into two rules: one formula for values of \\(t\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\) inclusive, and another for values of \\(t\\) greater than \\(20\\). Since \\(t=10\\) satisfies the inequality \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), we use the first formula listed, \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), to find \\(h(10)\\). We get \\(h(10)=-5(10)^{2}+100(10)=500\\). Since \\(t\\) represents the number of seconds since lift-off and \\(h(t)\\) is the height above the ground in feet, the equation \\(h(10)=500\\) means that \\(10\\) seconds after lift-off, the model rocket is \\(500\\) feet above the ground. To find \\(h(60)\\), we note that \\(t=60\\) satisfies \\(t>20\\), so we use the rule \\(h(t)=0\\). This function returns a value of \\(0\\) regardless of what value is substituted in for \\(t\\), so \\(h(60)=0\\). This means that \\(60\\) seconds after lift-off, the rocket is \\(0\\) feet above the ground; in other words, a minute after lift-off, the rocket has already returned to Earth.\n2. Since the function \\(h\\) is defined in pieces, we need to solve \\(h(t)=375\\) in pieces. For \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), so for these values of \\(t\\), we solve \\(-5t^{2}+100t=375\\). Rearranging terms, we get \\(5t^{2}-100t+375=0\\), and factoring gives \\(5(t-5)(t-15)=0\\). Our answers are \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\), and since both of these values of \\(t\\) lie between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\), we keep both solutions. For \\(t>20\\), \\(h(t)=0\\), and in this case, there are no solutions to \\(0=375\\). In terms of the model rocket, solving \\(h(t)=375\\) corresponds to finding when, if ever, the rocket reaches \\(375\\) feet above the ground. Our two answers, \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\) correspond to the rocket reaching this altitude _twice_ - once \\(5\\) seconds after launch, and again \\(15\\) seconds after launch.12\n\n\n",

To begin, we rewrite \\(4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)>\\pi\\) as \\(4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi>0\\). We let \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi\\), and note the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). To find the zeros of \\(f\\), we set \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi=0\\) and solve. We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), and since \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arccotangent, we may apply Theorem 10.27 and solve \\[\\operatorname{arccot}(3x) = \\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[3x = 1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\operatorname{cot}( \\operatorname{arccot}(u))=u.\\] \\[x = \\tfrac{1}{3}\\] Next, we make a sign diagram for \\(f\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, and there is only one zero of \\(f\\), \\(x=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we have two test intervals, \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\infty\\right)\\). Ideally, we wish to find test values \\(x\\) in these intervals so that \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(4x)\\) corresponds to one of our off-used 'common' angles. After a bit of computation,18 we choose \\(x=0\\) for \\(x<\\frac{1}{3}\\) and for \\(x>\\frac{1}{3}\\), we choose \\(x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). We find \\(f(0)=\\pi>0\\) and \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi}{3}<0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=4\\operatorname{arccot}(3x)-\\pi>0\\), we get our answer \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\).

What is h''(x) when x = 1?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nFootnote 6: In Calculus, we will see how these ‘holes’ can be ‘plugged’ when embarking on a more advanced study of continuity.\nNeither \\(x=-1\\) nor \\(x=1\\) are in the domain of \\(h\\), yet the behavior of the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) is drastically different near these \\(x\\)-values. The reason for this lies in the second to last step when we simplified the formula for \\(h(x)\\) in Example 4.1.1, where we had \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\). The reason \\(x=-1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) is because the factor \\((x+1)\\) appears in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\); similarly, \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) because of the factor \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\). The major difference between these two factors is that \\((x-1)\\) cancels with a factor in the numerator whereas \\((x+1)\\) does not. Loosely speaking, the trouble caused by \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator is canceled away while the factor \\((x+1)\\) remains to cause mischief. This is why the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) but only a hole at \\(x=1\\). These observations are generalized and summarized in the theorem below, whose proof is found in Calculus.\n**Theorem 4.1**.: **Location of Vertical Asymptotes and Holes:**_a_ Suppose \\(r\\) is a rational function which can be written as \\(r(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have no common zeros.b Let \\(c\\) be a real number which is not in the domain of \\(r\\).\n\n\n",

The reasoning is this: we know that problem one can be solved easily by finding a function whose derivative is \\(3t\\). We also know that mathematically the two problems are the same, because both can be solved by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore, we don't really need to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer by computing a function with the derivative \\(3t\\) or, which is the same thing, \\(3x\\).\nIt's true that the first problem had the added complication of the \"10\", and we certainly need to be able to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple. The lesson then is this: whenever we can solve a problem by taking the limit of a sum of a certain form, we can instead of computing the (often nasty) limit find a new function with a certain derivative.\n#### Exercises 7.1\n1.

First note the difference between the answers for \\(f(2x)\\) and \\(2f(x)\\). For \\(f(2x)\\), we are multiplying the _input_ by \\(2\\); for \\(2f(x)\\), we are multiplying the _output_ by \\(2\\). As we see, we get entirely different results. Along these lines, note that \\(f(x+2)\\), \\(f(x)+2\\) and \\(f(x)+f(2)\\) are three _different_ expressions as well. Even though function notation uses parentheses, as does multiplication, there is _no_ general 'distributive property' of function notation. Finally, note the practice of using parentheses when substituting one algebraic expression into another; we highly recommend this practice as it will reduce careless errors.\n\n\n",

This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\n\n",
