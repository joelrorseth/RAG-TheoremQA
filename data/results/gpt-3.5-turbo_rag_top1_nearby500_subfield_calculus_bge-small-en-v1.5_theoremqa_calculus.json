We compute \\(x^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\), \\(y^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{\\sin t}{1-\\cos t}.\\]\nNote that when \\(t\\) is an odd multiple of \\(\\pi\\), like \\(\\pi\\) or \\(3\\pi\\), this is \\((0/2)=0\\), so there is a horizontal tangent line, in agreement with figure 10.4.1. At even multiples of \\(\\pi\\), the fraction is \\(0/0\\), which is undefined. The figure shows that there is no tangent line at such points. \\(\\Box\\)\nAreas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on the curve and the area desired. We can potentially compute areas between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis quite easily.\n##### Example 10.5.2\nFind the area under one arch of the cycloid \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\). We would like to compute\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y\\;dx,\\]\nbut we do not know \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\). However, the parametric equations allow us to make a substitution: use \\(y=1-\\cos t\\) to replace \\(y\\), and compute \\(dx=(1-\\cos t)\\;dt\\). Then the integral becomes\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(1-\\cos t)(1-\\cos t)\\;dt=3\\pi.\\]\nFigure 10.4.4: An involute of a circle.\n### Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations\nNote that we need to convert the original \\(x\\) limits to \\(t\\) limits using \\(x=t-\\sin t\\). When \\(x=0\\), \\(t=\\sin t\\), which happens only when \\(t=0\\). Likewise, when \\(x=2\\pi\\), \\(t-2\\pi=\\sin t\\) and \\(t=2\\pi\\). Alternately, because we understand how the cycloid is produced, we can see directly that one arch is generated by \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\). In general, of course, the \\(t\\) limits will be different than the \\(x\\) limits. \\(\\Box\\)\nThis technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas, as illustrated by the exercises.\nAs a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric equations. Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), and develops the formula for length:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx.\\]\nUsing some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use parametric equations \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx&=\\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;\\frac{dt}{dx}\\;dx\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2}}\\;dt\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v} \\sqrt{(f^{\\prime}(t))^{2}+(g^{\\prime}(t))^{2}}\\;dt.}\\]\nHere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the \\(t\\) limits corresponding to the \\(x\\) limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n**EXAMPLE 10.5.3** Find the length of one arch of the cycloid. From \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\), we get the derivatives \\(f^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so the length is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{(1-\\cos t)^{2}+\\sin^{2}t}\\;dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{2-2 \\cos t}\\;dt.\\]\nNow we use the formula \\(\\sin^{2}(t/2)=(1-\\cos(t))/2\\) or \\(4\\sin^{2}(t/2)=2-2\\cos t\\) to get\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{4\\sin^{2}(t/2)}\\;dt.\\]\nSince \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\), \\(\\sin(t/2)\\geq 0\\), so we can rewrite this as\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}2\\sin(t/2)\\;dt=8.\\]\n### 10.5 Calculus with Parametric Equations\nExercises 10.5.1: Consider the curve of exercise 6 in section 10.4.

We can graph \\(g\\) using the six step procedure outlined in Section 4.2. We get the sole intercept at \\((0,0)\\), a vertical asymptote \\(x=1\\) and a horizontal asymptote (which the graph never crosses) \\(y=-2\\). We see from that the graph of \\(g\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test.\n3. 1. We begin with \\(h(c)=h(d)\\). As we work our way through the problem, we encounter a nonlinear equation. We move the non-zero terms to the left, leave a \\(0\\) on the right and factor accordingly. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}h(c)&=&h(d)\\\\ c^{2}-2c+4&=&d^{2}-2d+4\\\\ c^{2}-2c&=&d^{2}-2d\\\\ c^{2}-d^{2}-2c+2d&=&0\\\\ (c+d)(c-d)-2(c-d)&=&0\\\\ (c-d)((c+d)-2)&=&0\\\\ c-d=0&\\mbox{or}&c+d-2=0\\\\ c=d&\\mbox{or}&c=2-d\\end{array}\\] factor by grouping We get \\(c=d\\) as one possibility, but we also get the possibility that \\(c=2-d\\). This suggests that \\(f\\) may not be one-to-one. Taking \\(d=0\\), we get \\(c=0\\) or \\(c=2\\). With \\(f(0)=4\\) and \\(f(2)=4\\), we have produced two different inputs with the same output meaning \\(f\\) is not one-to-one. 2. We note that \\(h\\) is a quadratic function and we graph \\(y=h(x)\\) using the techniques presented in Section 2.3. The vertex is \\((1,3)\\) and the parabola opens upwards. We see immediately from the graph that \\(h\\) is not one-to-one, since there are several horizontal lines which cross the graph more than once.\n4. 1. The function \\(F\\) is given to us as a set of ordered pairs. The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\nWe have shown that the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1 are one-to-one. This means they are invertible, so it is natural to wonder what \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) would be. For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\). We can track step-by-step what is done to \\(x\\) and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter. The function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x}{1-x}\\) is a bit trickier since \\(x\\) occurs in two places. When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem. Theorem 5.2 tells us equation \\(y=f^{-1}(x)\\) is equivalent to \\(f(y)=x\\) and this is the basis of our algorithm.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|} \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Steps for finding the Inverse of a One-to-one Function**} \\\\\n1.

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\nguarantees that \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? Of course: no matter what \\(\\epsilon\\) is, \\(\\delta=\\epsilon\\) works. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it turns out to be very easy to prove something \"obvious,\" which is nice. It doesn't take long before things get trickier, however.\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\nThis has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:\nProof that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Given any \\(\\epsilon\\), pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Then when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), \\(|x+2|<5\\) and \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nDoes $p(x) = x^5 + x − 1$ have any real roots?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIn Section 3.1, we discussed the notion of the multiplicity of a zero. Roughly speaking, a zero with multiplicity \\(2\\) can be divided twice into a polynomial; multiplicity \\(3\\), three times and so on. This is illustrated in the next example.\n**Example 3.2.3.** Let \\(p(x)=4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3\\). Given that \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\) is a zero of multiplicity \\(2\\), find all of the real zeros of \\(p\\).\n**Solution.** We set up for synthetic division. Since we are told the multiplicity of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is two, we continue our tableau and divide \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) into the quotient polynomial\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\\frac{1}{2}&4&-4&-11&12&-3\\\\ \\downarrow&2&-1&-6&3\\\\ \\hline 4&-2&-12&6&0\\\\ \\downarrow&2&0&-6\\\\ \\hline 4&0&-12&0\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nFrom the first division, we get \\(4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(4x^{3}-2x^{2}-12 x+6\\right)\\). The second division tells us \\(4x^{3}-2x^{2}-12x+6=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(4x^{2}-12\\right)\\). Combining these results, we have \\(4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(4x^{2}-12\\right)\\). To find the remaining zeros of \\(p\\), we set \\(4x^{2}-12=0\\) and get \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\).\nA couple of things about the last example are worth mentioning. First, the extension of the synthetic division tableau for repeated divisions will be a common site in the sections to come. Typically, we will start with a higher order polynomial and peel off one zero at a time until we are left with a quadratic, whose roots can always be found using the Quadratic Formula. Secondly, we found \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\) are zeros of \\(p\\). The Factor Theorem guarantees \\(\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x-\\left(-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\) are both factors of \\(p\\). We can certainly put the Factor Theorem to the test and continue the synthetic division tableau from above to see what happens.\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\\frac{1}{2}&4&-4&-11&12&-3\\\\ \\downarrow&2&-1&-6&3\\\\ \\hline\\frac{1}{2}&4&-2&-12&6&0\\\\ \\downarrow&2&0&-6\\\\ \\hline\\sqrt{3}&\\framebox{4}&0&-12&0\\\\ \\downarrow&4\\sqrt{3}&12\\\\ \\downarrow&4\\sqrt{3}&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4\\sqrt{3}&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4\\sqrt{3}&\\\\ \\hline 4&\\framebox{0}\\end{array}\\]\nThis gives us \\(4x^{4}-4x^{3}-11x^{2}+12x-3=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-\\sqrt{3} \\right)\\left(x-\\left(-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\left(4\\right)\\), or, when written with the constant in front\n\\[p(x)=4\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left(- \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right)\\]\nWe have shown that \\(p\\) is a product of its leading coefficient times linear factors of the form \\((x-c)\\) where \\(c\\) are zeros of \\(p\\). It may surprise and delight the reader that, in theory, all polynomials can be reduced to this kind of factorization. We leave that discussion to Section 3.4, because the zeros may not be real numbers. Our final theorem in the section gives us an upper bound on the number of real zeros.\n**Theorem 3.7**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a polynomial of degree \\(n\\geq 1\\). Then \\(f\\) has at most \\(n\\) real zeros, counting multiplicities.\nTheorem 3.7 is a consequence of the Factor Theorem and polynomial multiplication. Every zero \\(c\\) of \\(f\\) gives us a factor of the form \\((x-c)\\) for \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(f\\) has degree \\(n\\), there can be at most \\(n\\) of these factors. The next section provides us some tools which not only help us determine where the real zeros are to be found, but which real numbers they may be.\nWe close this section with a summary of several concepts previously presented. You should take the time to look back through the text to see where each concept was first introduced and where each connection to the other concepts was made.\n**Connections Between Zeros, Factors and Graphs of Polynomial Functions**\nSuppose \\(p\\) is a polynomial function of degree \\(n\\geq 1\\). The following statements are equivalent:\n* The real number \\(c\\) is a zero of \\(p\\)\n* \\(p(c)=0\\)\n* \\(x=c\\) is a solution to the polynomial equation \\(p(x)=0\\)\n\n\n",

Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).

To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n3. Since \\(\\cot(3x)=0\\) has the form \\(\\cot(u)=0\\), we know \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\), so, in this case, \\(3x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) yields \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}k\\). Checking our answers, we get \\[\\cot\\left(3\\left[\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}+\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}k\\right]\\right) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of cotangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= 0\\] As \\(k\\) runs through the integers, we obtain six answers, corresponding to \\(k=0\\) through \\(k=5\\), which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\,\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\,\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\) , \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\). To confirm these graphically, we must be careful. On many calculators, there is no function button for cotangent. We choose4 to use the quotient identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis), we see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points approximately match our solutions. Footnote 4: The reader is encouraged to see what happens if we had chosen the reciprocal identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{1}{\\tan(3x)}\\) instead. The graph on the calculator _appears_ identical, but what happens when you try to find the intersection points?\n\n\n",

This sets as the range of . We see that the graph of crosses the -axis twice, so we expect two -intercepts. To find these, we set and solve. Doing so yields the equation , or . Extracting square roots gives , or . Our -intercepts are and . The -intercept of the graph, was one of the points we originally plotted, so we are done.\n2. Following Theorem 1.7 once more, to graph start by _adding_ to each of the -values of the points on the graph of . This effects a horizontal shift units and moves to , , , to , and to . Next, we _multiply_ each of our -values first by and then _add_ to that result. Geometrically, this is a vertical _stretch_ by a factor of , followed by a reflection about the -axis, followed by a vertical shift unit. This moves to , , to , , and to . The vertex is which makes the range of . From our graph, we know that there are two -intercepts, so we set and solve. We get\nwhich gives \\((x-3)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\). Extracting square roots1 gives \\(x-3=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), so that when we add \\(3\\) to each side,2 we get \\(x=\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Hence, our \\(x\\)-intercepts are \\(\\left(\\frac{6-\\sqrt{2}}{2},0\\right)\\approx(2.29,0)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{6+\\sqrt{2}}{2},0\\right)\\approx(3.71,0)\\). Although our graph doesn't show it, there is a \\(y\\)-intercept which can be found by setting \\(x=0\\). With \\(h(0)=-2(0-3)^{2}+1=-17\\), we have that our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,-17)\\).\nFootnote 1: and rationalizing denominators!\nFootnote 2: and get common denominators!\nA few remarks about Example 2.3.1 are in order. First note that neither the formula given for \\(g(x)\\) nor the one given for \\(h(x)\\) match the form given in Definition 2.5. We could, of course, convert both \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) into that form by expanding and collecting like terms. Doing so, we find \\(g(x)=(x+2)^{2}-3=x^{2}+4x+1\\) and \\(h(x)=-2(x-3)^{2}+1=-2x^{2}+12x-17\\). While these 'simplified' formulas for \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) satisfy Definition 2.5, they do not lend themselves to graphing easily. For that reason, the form of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) presented in Example 2.3.2 is given a special name, which we list below, along with the form presented in Definition 2.5.\n**Definition 2.6**.: **Standard and General Form of Quadratic Functions**: Suppose \\(f\\) is a quadratic function.\n* The **general form** of the quadratic function \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\).\n* The **standard form** of the quadratic function \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k\\), where \\(a\\), \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\).\nIt is important to note at this stage that we have no guarantees that _every_ quadratic function can be written in standard form. This is actually true, and we prove this later in the exposition, but for now we celebrate the advantages of the standard form, starting with the following theorem.\n**Theorem 2.2**.: **Vertex Formula for Quadratics in Standard Form**: For the quadratic function \\(f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k\\), where \\(a\\), \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\), the vertex of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) is \\((h,k)\\).\n\n\n",

Since we have the same base on both sides of the equation \\(\\log_{117}(1-3x)=\\log_{117}\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\), we equate what's inside the logs to get \\(1-3x=x^{2}-3\\). Solving \\(x^{2}+3x-4=0\\) gives \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=1\\). To check these answers using the calculator, we make use of the change of base formula and graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-3x)}{\\ln(117)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)}{\\ln(117)}\\) and we see they intersect only at \\(x=-4\\). To see what happened to the solution \\(x=1\\), we substitute it into our original equation to obtain \\(\\log_{117}(-2)=\\log_{117}(-2)\\). While these expressions look identical, neither is a real number,1 which means \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of the original equation, and is not a solution. Footnote 1: They do, however, represent the same **family** of complex numbers. We stop ourselves at this point and refer the reader to a good course in Complex Variables.\n2. Our first objective in solving \\(2-\\ln(x-3)=1\\) is to isolate the logarithm. We get \\(\\ln(x-3)=1\\), which, as an exponential equation, is \\(e^{1}=x-3\\). We get our solution \\(x=e+3\\). On the calculator, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=2-\\ln(x-3)\\) intersects the graph of \\(g(x)=1\\) at \\(x=e+3\\approx 5.718\\).\n3. We can start solving \\(\\log_{6}(x+4)+\\log_{6}(3-x)=1\\) by using the Product Rule for logarithms to rewrite the equation as \\(\\log_{6}\\left[(x+4)(3-x)\\right]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation, we get \\(6^{1}=(x+4)(3-x)\\). This reduces to \\(x^{2}+x-6=0\\), which gives \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\). Graphing \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+4)}{\\ln(6)}+\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(6)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1\\), we see they intersect twice, at \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\).\n4. Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\). When we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+3)}{\\ln(2)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln(6-x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\), we find they intersect at \\(x=5\\).\n6. Starting with \\(1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\), we gather the logs to one side to get the equation \\(1=2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\). Before we can combine the logarithms, however, we need a common base. Since 4 is a power of 2, we use change of base to convert \\[\\log_{4}(x+1)=\\frac{\\log_{2}(x+1)}{\\log_{2}(4)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Hence, our original equation becomes \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\right)\\] \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Power Rule \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}\\right)\\] Quotient Rule Rewriting this in exponential form, we get \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}=2\\) or \\(x^{2}-2x-2=0\\). Using the quadratic formula, we get \\(x=1\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\). Graphing \\(f(x)=1+\\frac{2\\ln(x+1)}{\\ln(4)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\), we see the graphs intersect only at \\(x=1+\\sqrt{3}\\approx 2.732\\). The solution \\(x=1-\\sqrt{3}<0\\), which means if substituted into the original equation, the term \\(2\\log_{2}\\left(1-\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\) is undefined.\n\\(y=f(x)=1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\) and \\(y=g(x)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\)\nIf nothing else, Example 6.4.1 demonstrates the importance of checking for extraneous solutions2 when solving equations involving logarithms. Even though we checked our answers graphically, extraneous solutions are easy to spot - any supposed solution which causes a negative number inside a logarithm needs to be discarded. As with the equations in Example 6.3.1, much can be learned from checking all of the answers in Example 6.4.1 analytically. We leave this to the reader and turn our attention to inequalities involving logarithmic functions. Since logarithmic functions are continuous on their domains, we can use sign diagrams.\nFootnote 2: Recall that an extraneous solution is an answer obtained analytically which does not satisfy the original equation.\n**Example 6.4.2**.: Solve the following inequalities.

What is y(4)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nExample 17.1.6 Consider this specific example of an initial value problem for Newton's law of cooling: , . We first note that if , the right hand side of the differential equation is zero, and so the constant function is a solution to the differential equation. It is not a solution to the initial value problem, since . (The physical interpretation of this constant solution is that if a liquid is at the same temperature as its surroundings, then the liquid will stay at that temperature.)\n### First Order Differential Equations\nSo long as \\(y\\) is not 25, we can rewrite the differential equation as\n\\[\\eqalign{{dy\\over dt}{1\\over 25-y}&=2\\cr{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=2\\,dt,}\\]\nso\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy=\\int 2\\,dt,\\]\nthat is, the two anti-derivatives must be the same except for a constant difference. We can calculate these anti-derivatives and rearrange the results:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\nAs before, all solutions are represented by \\(y=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}\\), allowing \\(A\\) to be zero. \\(\\Box\\)\n**DEFINITION 17.1.8**: A first order differential equation is **separable** if it can be written in the form \\(\\dot{y}=f(t)g(y)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nAs in the examples, we can attempt to solve a separable equation by converting to the form\n\\[\\int{1\\over g(y)}\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nThis technique is called **separation of variables**. The simplest (in principle) sort of separable equation is one in which \\(g(y)=1\\), in which case we attempt to solve\n\\[\\int 1\\,dy=\\int f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nWe can do this if we can find an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)\\).\nAlso as we have seen so far, a differential equation typically has an infinite number of solutions. Ideally, but certainly not always, a corresponding initial value problem will have just one solution. A solution in which there are no unknown constants remaining is called a **particular solution**.\nThe general approach to separable equations is this: Suppose we wish to solve \\(\\dot{y}=f(t)g(y)\\) where \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are continuous functions. If \\(g(a)=0\\) for some \\(a\\) then \\(y(t)=a\\) is a constant solution of the equation, since in this case \\(\\dot{y}=0=f(t)g(a)\\). For example, \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}-1\\) has constant solutions \\(y(t)=1\\) and \\(y(t)=-1\\).\n\n\n",

Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe rest of the points follow suit, and we connect them with the same basic shape as before. We confirm the domain of \\(g\\) is \\([0,\\infty)\\) and find the range of \\(g\\) to be \\([-1,\\infty)\\). 3. Solving \\(x-1\\geq 0\\) gives \\(x\\geq 1\\), so the domain of \\(j\\) is \\([1,\\infty)\\). To graph \\(j\\), we note that \\(j(x)=f(x-1)\\). In other words, we are subtracting \\(1\\) from the _input_ of \\(f\\). According to Theorem 1.3, this induces a shift to the right of the graph of \\(f\\). We add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) and get the result below. The graph reaffirms that the domain of \\(j\\) is \\([1,\\infty)\\) and tells us that the range of \\(j\\) is \\([0,\\infty)\\). 4. To find the domain of \\(m\\), we solve \\(x+3\\geq 0\\) and get \\([-3,\\infty)\\). Comparing the formulas of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(m(x)\\), we have \\(m(x)=f(x+3)-2\\). We have \\(3\\) being added to an input, indicating a horizontal shift, and \\(2\\) being subtracted from an output, indicating a vertical shift. We leave it to the reader to verify that, in this particular case, the order in which we perform these transformations is immaterial; we will arrive at the same graph regardless as to which transformation we apply first.2 We follow the convention 'inputs first',3 and to that end we first tackle the horizontal shift. Letting \\(m_{1}(x)=f(x+3)\\) denote this intermediate step, Theorem 1.3 tells us that the graph of \\(y=m_{1}(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) shifted to the left \\(3\\) units. Hence, we subtract \\(3\\) from each of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\). 3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSince \\(m(x)=f(x+3)-2\\) and \\(f(x+3)=m_{\\texttt{1}}(x)\\), we have \\(m(x)=m_{\\texttt{1}}(x)-2\\). We can apply Theorem 1.2 and obtain the graph of \\(m\\) by subtracting \\(2\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates of each of the points on the graph of \\(m_{\\texttt{1}}(x)\\). The graph verifies that the domain of \\(m\\) is \\([-3,\\infty)\\) and we find the range of \\(m\\) to be \\([-2,\\infty)\\).\nKeep in mind that we can check our answer to any of these kinds of problems by showing that any of the points we've moved lie on the graph of our final answer. For example, we can check that \\((-3,-2)\\) is on the graph of \\(m\\) by computing \\(m(-3)=\\sqrt{(-3)+3}-2=\\sqrt{0}-2=-2\\,\\checkmark\\)\nWe now turn our attention to reflections. We know from Section 1.1 that to reflect a point \\((x,y)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis, we replace \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\). If \\((x,y)\\) is on the graph of \\(f\\), then \\(y=f(x)\\), so replacing \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\) is the same as replacing \\(f(x)\\) with \\(-f(x)\\). Hence, the graph of \\(y=-f(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(x\\)-axis. Similarly, the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis. Returning to the language of inputs and outputs, multiplying the output from a function by \\(-1\\) reflects its graph across the \\(x\\)-axis, while multiplying the input to a function by \\(-1\\) reflects the graph across the \\(y\\)-axis.4\n**Theorem 1.4**.: **Reflections.** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function.\n* To graph \\(y=-f(x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\n* To graph \\(y=f(-x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\nApplying Theorem 1.4 to the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) given at the beginning of the section, we can graph \\(y=-f(x)\\) by reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis\nBy reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis, we obtain the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\).\nWith the addition of reflections, it is now more important than ever to consider the order of transformations, as the next example illustrates.\n**Example 1.7.2**.: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Use the graph of \\(f\\) from Example 1.7.1 to graph the following functions.

Find dy/dt at this moment.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**34.**: You are standing near the side of a large wading pool of uniform depth when you see a child in trouble. You can run at a speed \\(v_{1}\\) on land and at a slower speed \\(v_{2}\\) in the water. Your perpendicular distance from the side of the pool is \\(a\\), the child's perpendicular distance is \\(b\\), and the distance along the side of the pool between the closest point to you and the closest point to the child is \\(c\\) (see the figure below). Without stopping to do any calculus, you instinctively choose the quickest route (shown in the figure) and save the child. Our purpose is to derive a relation between the angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) your path makes with the perpendicular to the side of the pool when you're on land, and the angle \\(\\theta_{2}\\) your path makes with the perpendicular when you're in the water. To do this, let \\(x\\) be the distance between the closest point to you at the side of the pool and the point where you enter the water. Write the total time you run (on land and in the water) in terms of \\(x\\) (and also the constants \\(a,b,c,v_{1},v_{2}\\)). Then set the derivative equal to zero. The result, called \"Snell's law\" or the \"law of refraction,\" also governs the bending of light when it goes into water. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n### 6.2 Related Rates\nSuppose we have two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (in most problems the letters will be different, but for now let's use \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) which are both changing with time. A \"related rates\" problem is a problem in which we know one of the rates of change at a given instant--say,\nFigure 6.1.7: Wading pool rescue.\n\\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\)--and we want to find the other rate \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\) at that instant. (The use of \\(\\dot{x}\\) to mean \\(dx/dt\\) goes back to Newton and is still used for this purpose, especially by physicists.)\nIf \\(y\\) is written in terms of \\(x\\), i.e., \\(y=f(x)\\), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n**1.**: Decide what the two variables are.\n**2.**: Find an equation relating them.\n**3.**: Take \\(d/dt\\) of both sides.\n**4.**: Plug in all known values at the instant in question.\n\n\n",

So we suppose we have divided the interval \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals as usual, each with length \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), and endpoints \\(a=x_{0}\\), \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), ..., \\(x_{n}=b\\). The length of a typical line segment, joining \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\) to \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), is \\(\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^{2}+(f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i}))^{2}}\\). By the Mean Value Theorem (6.5.2), there is a number \\(t_{i}\\) in \\((x_{i},x_{i+1})\\) such that \\(f^{\\prime}(t_{i})\\Delta x=f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i})\\), so the length of\nFigure 9.1: The length of a line segment.\nthe line segment can be written as\n\\[\\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^{2}+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i}))^{2}\\Delta x^{2}}=\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i }))^{2}}\\,\\Delta x.\\]\nThe arc length is then\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(t_{i}))^{2}}\\,\\Delta x= \\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nNote that the sum looks a bit different than others we have encountered, because the approximation contains a \\(t_{i}\\) instead of an \\(x_{i}\\). In the past we have always used left endpoints (namely, \\(x_{i}\\)) to get a representative value of \\(f\\) on \\([x_{i},x_{i+1}]\\); now we are using a different point, but the principle is the same.\nTo summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval \\([a,b]\\), we compute the integral\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, integrals of this form are typically difficult or impossible to compute exactly, because usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work. In practice this means that the integral will usually have to be approximated.\nLet \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\), the upper half circle of radius \\(r\\). The length of this curve is half the circumference, namely \\(\\pi r\\). Let's compute this with the arc length formula. The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is \\(-x/\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) so the integral is\n\\[\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{x^{2}}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx=\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{r ^{2}}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx=r\\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^{2}-x^{2}}}\\,dx.\\]\nUsing a trigonometric substitution, we find the antiderivative, namely \\(\\arcsin(x/r)\\). Notice that the integral is improper at both endpoints, as the function \\(\\sqrt{1/(r^{2}-x^{2})}\\) is undefined\nFigure 9.2: Approximating arc length with line segments.\n### Chapter 9 Applications of Integration\nwhen \\(x=\\pm r\\).

If \\({\\bf F}\\) is a conservative force field, then the integral for work, \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\), is in the form required by the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals. This means that in a conservative force field, the amount of work required to move an object from point \\({\\bf a}\\) to point \\({\\bf b}\\) depends only on those points, not on the path taken between them.\n**Example 16.3.2**: An object moves in the force field\n\\[{\\bf F}=\\left\\langle\\frac{-x}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-y}{(x^{2}+y^{ 2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-z}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}}\\right\\rangle,\\]\nalong the curve \\({\\bf r}=\\langle 1+t,t^{3},t\\cos(\\pi t)\\rangle\\) as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Find the work done by the force on the object.\nThe straightforward way to do this involves substituting the components of \\({\\bf r}\\) into \\({\\bf F}\\), forming the dot product \\({\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\), and then trying to compute the integral, but this integral is extraordinarily messy, perhaps impossible to compute. But since \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla(1/\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}})\\) we need only substitute:\n\\[\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\left.\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right| _{(1,0,0)}^{(2,1,-1)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}-1.\\]\n### The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals\nAnother immediate consequence of the Fundamental Theorem involves **closed paths**. A path \\(C\\) is closed if it forms a loop, so that traveling over the \\(C\\) curve brings you back to the starting point. If \\(C\\) is a closed path, we can integrate around it starting at any point \\({\\bf a}\\); since the starting and ending points are the same,\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=f({\\bf a})-f({\\bf a})=0.\\]\nFor example, in a gravitational field (an inverse square law field) the amount of work required to move an object around a closed path is zero. Of course, it's only the _net_ amount of work that is zero. It may well take a great deal of work to get from point \\({\\bf a}\\) to point \\({\\bf b}\\), but then the return trip will \"produce\" work. For example, it takes work to pump water from a lower to a higher elevation, but if you then let gravity pull the water back down, you can recover work by running a water wheel or generator. (In the real world you won't recover all the work because of various losses along the way.)\nTo make use of the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, we need to be able to spot conservative vector fields \\({\\bf F}\\) and to compute \\(f\\) so that \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla f\\). Suppose that \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle=\\nabla f\\). Then \\(P=f_{x}\\) and \\(Q=f_{y}\\), and provided that \\(f\\) is sufficiently nice, we know from Clairaut's Theorem (14.6.2) that \\(P_{y}=f_{xy}=f_{yx}=Q_{x}\\). If we compute \\(P_{y}\\) and \\(Q_{x}\\) and find that they are not equal, then \\({\\bf F}\\) is not conservative. If \\(P_{y}=Q_{x}\\), then, again provided that \\({\\bf F}\\) is sufficiently nice, we can be assured that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative. Ultimately, what's important is that we be able to find \\(f\\); as this amounts to finding anti-derivatives, we may not always succeed.\n\n\n",

What is the limit of $g(x)/x$ as $x$ goes to infinity?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThis has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:\nProof that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Given any \\(\\epsilon\\), pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Then when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), \\(|x+2|<5\\) and \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\nwe don't have to worry about it ever again. When we say that \\(x\\) might be \"complicated\" we really mean that in practice it might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:\n**Theorem 2.3.5** Suppose \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\). Then\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\n_Proof._ We have to use the official definition of limit to make sense of this. So given any \\(\\epsilon\\) we need to find a \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|f(x)g(x)-LM|<\\epsilon\\). What do we have to work with? We know that we can make \\(f(x)\\) close to \\(L\\) and \\(g(x)\\) close to \\(M\\), and we have to somehow connect these facts to make \\(f(x)g(x)\\) close to \\(LM\\).\nWe use, as is so often the case, a little algebraic trick:\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&=|f(x)g(x)-f(x)M+f(x)M-LM|\\cr&=|f(x)(g(x)-M)+(f(x)-L)M| \\cr&\\leq|f(x)(g(x)-M)|+|(f(x)-L)M|\\cr&=|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|.\\cr}\\]\nThis is all straightforward except perhaps for the \"\\(\\leq\\)\". That is an example of the **triangle inequality**, which says that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers then \\(|a+b|\\leq|a|+|b|\\). If you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.\nSince \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\), there is a value \\(\\delta_{1}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{1}\\) implies \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), This means that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{1}\\) implies \\(|f(x)-L||M|<\\epsilon/2\\). You can see where this is going: if we can make \\(|f(x)||g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/2\\) also, then we'll be done.\nWe can make \\(|g(x)-M|\\) smaller than any fixed number by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\); unfortunately, \\(\\epsilon/(2f(x))\\) is not a fixed number, since \\(x\\) is a variable. Here we need another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing \\(x^{2}\\). We can find a \\(\\delta_{2}\\) so that \\(|x-a|<\\delta_{2}\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<1\\), meaning that \\(L-1<f(x)<L+1\\). This means that \\(|f(x)|<N\\), where \\(N\\) is either \\(|L-1|\\) or \\(|L+1|\\), depending on whether \\(L\\) is negative or positive. The important point is that \\(N\\) doesn't depend on \\(x\\). Finally, we know that there is a \\(\\delta_{3}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{3}\\) implies \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Now we're ready to put everything together. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the smallest of \\(\\delta_{1}\\), \\(\\delta_{2}\\), and \\(\\delta_{3}\\). Then \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), \\(|f(x)|<N\\), and \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Then\n\n\n",

An obvious guess for the derivative of \\(f\\) is the product of the derivatives of the constituent functions: \\((2x)(3x^{2}-3)=6x^{3}-6x\\). Is this correct? We can easily check, by rewriting \\(f\\) and doing the calculation in a way that is known to work. First, \\(f(x)=x^{5}-3x^{3}+x^{3}-3x=x^{5}-2x^{3}-3x\\), and then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=5x^{4}-6x^{2}-3\\). Not even close! What went \"wrong\"? Well, nothing really, except the guess was wrong.\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\nReturning to the example we started with, let \\(f(x)=(x^{2}+1)(x^{3}-3x)\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=(x^{2}+1)(3x^{2}-3)+(2x)(x^{3}-3x)=3x^{4}-3x^{2}+3x^{2}-3+2x^{4} -6x^{2}=5x^{4}-6x^{2}-3\\), as before.

We compute \\(x^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\), \\(y^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{\\sin t}{1-\\cos t}.\\]\nNote that when \\(t\\) is an odd multiple of \\(\\pi\\), like \\(\\pi\\) or \\(3\\pi\\), this is \\((0/2)=0\\), so there is a horizontal tangent line, in agreement with figure 10.4.1. At even multiples of \\(\\pi\\), the fraction is \\(0/0\\), which is undefined. The figure shows that there is no tangent line at such points. \\(\\Box\\)\nAreas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on the curve and the area desired. We can potentially compute areas between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis quite easily.\n##### Example 10.5.2\nFind the area under one arch of the cycloid \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\). We would like to compute\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y\\;dx,\\]\nbut we do not know \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\). However, the parametric equations allow us to make a substitution: use \\(y=1-\\cos t\\) to replace \\(y\\), and compute \\(dx=(1-\\cos t)\\;dt\\). Then the integral becomes\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}(1-\\cos t)(1-\\cos t)\\;dt=3\\pi.\\]\nFigure 10.4.4: An involute of a circle.\n### Chapter 10 Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations\nNote that we need to convert the original \\(x\\) limits to \\(t\\) limits using \\(x=t-\\sin t\\). When \\(x=0\\), \\(t=\\sin t\\), which happens only when \\(t=0\\). Likewise, when \\(x=2\\pi\\), \\(t-2\\pi=\\sin t\\) and \\(t=2\\pi\\). Alternately, because we understand how the cycloid is produced, we can see directly that one arch is generated by \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\). In general, of course, the \\(t\\) limits will be different than the \\(x\\) limits. \\(\\Box\\)\nThis technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas, as illustrated by the exercises.\nAs a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric equations. Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), and develops the formula for length:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx.\\]\nUsing some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use parametric equations \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx&=\\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;\\frac{dt}{dx}\\;dx\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2}}\\;dt\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v} \\sqrt{(f^{\\prime}(t))^{2}+(g^{\\prime}(t))^{2}}\\;dt.}\\]\nHere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the \\(t\\) limits corresponding to the \\(x\\) limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n**EXAMPLE 10.5.3** Find the length of one arch of the cycloid. From \\(x=t-\\sin t\\), \\(y=1-\\cos t\\), we get the derivatives \\(f^{\\prime}=1-\\cos t\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}=\\sin t\\), so the length is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{(1-\\cos t)^{2}+\\sin^{2}t}\\;dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{2-2 \\cos t}\\;dt.\\]\nNow we use the formula \\(\\sin^{2}(t/2)=(1-\\cos(t))/2\\) or \\(4\\sin^{2}(t/2)=2-2\\cos t\\) to get\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{4\\sin^{2}(t/2)}\\;dt.\\]\nSince \\(0\\leq t\\leq 2\\pi\\), \\(\\sin(t/2)\\geq 0\\), so we can rewrite this as\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}2\\sin(t/2)\\;dt=8.\\]\n### 10.5 Calculus with Parametric Equations\nExercises 10.5.1: Consider the curve of exercise 6 in section 10.4.

It also never exceeds the value 1 or drops below the value 0. Because the graph never increases or decreases without bound, we say that the function represented by the graph in (c) is a **bounded** function.\n### Chapter 2 Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative\n**DEFINITION 2.5.1 Bounded** A function \\(f\\) is bounded if there is a number \\(M\\) such that \\(|f(x)|<M\\) for every \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFor the function in (c), one such choice for \\(M\\) would be \\(10\\). However, the smallest (optimal) choice would be \\(M=1\\). In either case, simply finding an \\(M\\) is enough to establish boundedness. No such \\(M\\) exists for the hyperbola in (d) and hence we say that it is **unbounded**.\n**Continuity.** The graphs shown in (b) and (c) both represent **continuous** functions. Geometrically, this is because there are no jumps in the graphs. That is, if you pick a point on the graph and approach it from the left and right, the values of the function approach the value of the function at that point. For example, we can see that this is not true for function values near \\(x=-1\\) on the graph in (a) which is not continuous at that location.\nFigure 2.5.1: Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c) a bounded, differentiable function, (d) an unbounded, differentiable function\n**Definition 2.5.2**: **Continuous at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.3**: **Continuous** A function \\(f\\) is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. \\(\\Box\\)\nStrangely, we also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n**Definition 2.5.4**: **Differentiable at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable at point \\(a\\) if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) exists. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.5**: **Differentiable** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable if is differentiable at every point (excluding endpoints and isolated points in the domain of \\(f\\)) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTake note that, for technical reasons not discussed here, both of these definitions exclude endpoints and isolated points in the domain from consideration.\nWe close with a useful theorem about continuous functions:\n**Theorem 2.5.6**: **Intermediate Value Theorem** If \\(f\\) is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\) and \\(d\\) is between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\), then there is a number \\(c\\) in \\([a,b]\\) such that \\(f(c)=d\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\nThis is most frequently used when \\(d=0\\).\n**Example 2.5.7**: **Explain why the function \\(f=x^{3}+3x^{2}+x-2\\) has a root between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n\n",

Suppose that the path of an object is given by a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\); at any point along the path, the (small) tangent vector \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\,\\Delta t\\) gives an approximation to its motion over a short time \\(\\Delta t\\), so the work done during that time is approximately \\({\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\,\\Delta t\\); the total work over some time period is then\n\\[\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf r}^{\\prime}\\,dt.\\]\nIt is useful to rewrite this in various ways at different times.

The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\nTo compute the desired limit it is sufficient to compute the limits of the two final fractions, as \\(x\\) goes to 0. The first of these is the hard limit we've just done, namely 1. The second turns out to be simple, because the denominator presents no problem:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\sin 0}{\\cos 0+1}=\\frac{0}{2}=0.\\]\nThus,\n\n\n",

We resist the temptation to divide both sides of \\(3\\sin^{3}(x)=\\sin^{2}(x)\\) by \\(\\sin^{2}(x)\\) (What goes wrong if you do?) and instead gather all of the terms to one side of the equation and factor. \\[3\\sin^{3}(x) = \\sin^{2}(x)\\] \\[3\\sin^{3}(x)-\\sin^{2}(x) = 0\\] \\[\\sin^{2}(x)(3\\sin(x)-1) = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Factor out $\\sin^{2}(x)$ from both terms}.\\] We get \\(\\sin^{2}(x)=0\\) or \\(3\\sin(x)-1=0\\). Solving for \\(\\sin(x)\\), we find \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\). The solution to the first equation is \\(x=\\pi k\\), with \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) being the two solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To solve \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we use the arcsine function to get \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We find the two solutions here which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) to be \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\). To check graphically, we plot \\(y=3(\\sin(x))^{3}\\) and \\(y=(\\sin(x))^{2}\\) and find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of these two curves. Some extra zooming is required near \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) to verify that these two curves do in fact intersect four times.6 Footnote 6: Note that we are _not_ counting the point \\((2\\pi,0)\\) in our solution set since \\(x=2\\pi\\) is not in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\). In the forthcoming solutions, remember that while \\(x=2\\pi\\) may be a solution to the equation, it isn’t counted among the solutions in \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n2. Analysis of \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=\\tan(x)+3\\) reveals two different trigonometric functions, so an identity is in order. Since \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)\\), we get \\[\\sec^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\] \\[1+\\tan^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\quad\\text{(Since $\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)$.)}\\] \\[\\tan^{2}(x)-\\tan(x)-2 = 0\\] \\[u^{2}-u-2 = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Let $u=\\tan(x)$.}\\] \\[(u+1)(u-2) = 0\\]\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n4. To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\n\n\n",

The second derivative \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|\\) incorporates this notion of time, so it depends not simply on the geometric properties of the curve but on how quickly we move along the curve.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.5** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf s}(t)=\\langle\\cos 2t,\\sin 2t,0\\rangle\\). Both of these vector functions represent the unit circle in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, but if \\(t\\) is interpreted as time, the second describes an object moving twice as fast as the first. Computing the second derivatives, we find \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=1\\), \\(|{\\bf s}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)|=4\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nTo remove the dependence on time, we use the arc length parameterization. If a curve is given by \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), then the first derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit vector, that is, \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}(s)\\). We now compute the second derivative \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)\\) and use \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(s)|\\) as the \"official\" measure of **curvature**, usually denoted \\(\\kappa\\).\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.6** We have seen that the arc length parameterization of a particular helix is \\({\\bf r}(s)=\\langle\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2}),\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2}),s/\\sqrt{2}\\rangle\\). Computing the second derivative gives \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(s)=\\langle-\\cos(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,-\\sin(s/\\sqrt{2})/2,0\\rangle\\) with length \\(1/2\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)\nWhat if we are given a curve as a vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is not arc length? We have seen that arc length can be difficult to compute; fortunately, we do not need to convert to the arc length parameterization to compute curvature. Instead, let us imagine that we have done this, so we have found \\(t=g(s)\\) and then formed \\(\\hat{\\bf r}(s)={\\bf r}(g(s))\\). The first derivative \\(\\hat{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(s)\\) is a unit tangent vector, so it is the same as the unit tangent vector \\({\\bf T}(t)={\\bf T}(g(s))\\). Taking the derivative of this we get\n\\[{d\\over ds}{\\bf T}(g(s))={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(g(s))g^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime} (t){dt\\over ds}.\\]\nThe curvature is the length of this vector:\n\\[\\kappa=|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)||{dt\\over ds}|={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|ds/dt|} ={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}.\\]\n(Recall that we have seen that \\(ds/dt=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\).) Thus we can compute the curvature by computing only derivatives with respect to \\(t\\); we do not need to do the conversion to arc length.\n**EXAMPLE 13.3.7** Returning to the helix, suppose we start with the parameterization \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,t\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{2}\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,1\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}\\). Then \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\cos t,-\\sin t,0\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1/\\sqrt{2}\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=1/2\\), as before.\n### 13.3 Arc length and curvature\n**Example 13.3.8** Consider this circle of radius \\(a\\): \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle a\\cos t,a\\sin t,1\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=a\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle/a\\). Now \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\cos t,-a\\sin t,0\\rangle/a\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/a\\): the curvature of a circle is everywhere the reciprocal of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous example is \\(1/2\\); this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius \\(2\\), as shown in figure 13.3.1.\n**Figure 13.3.1** A circle with the same curvature as the helix. (AP)\n**Example 13.3.9** Consider \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,\\cos 2t\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 13.2.4. \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,-2\\sin(2t)\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}\\), so\n\\[{\\bf T}(t)=\\left\\langle\\frac{-\\sin t}{\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}},\\frac{\\cos t}{ \\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}},\\frac{-2\\sin 2t}{\\sqrt{1+4\\sin^{2}(2t)}}\\right\\rangle.\\]\nComputing the derivative of this and then the length of the resulting vector is possible but unpleasant.\n\n\n",

What is the numeric of the double integral of the function f(x,y)=x*y^3 exp^{x^2+y^2} over I?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nLet's review some laws of exponents and logarithms; let \\(a\\) be a positive number. Since \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\), it's clear that \\(a^{5}\\cdot a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a=a^{8}=a^{5 +3}\\), and in general that \\(a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\). Since \"the logarithm is the exponent,\" it's no surprise that this translates directly into a fact about the logarithm function. Here are three facts\nfrom the example: \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5})=5\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{3})=3\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8\\). So \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5}a^{3})=\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8=5+3=\\log_{a}(a^{5})+\\log_{a}(a^{3})\\). Now let's make this a bit more general. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two numbers, \\(A=a^{x}\\), and \\(B=a^{y}\\). Then \\(\\log_{a}(AB)=\\log_{a}(a^{x}a^{y})=\\log_{a}(a^{x+y})=x+y=\\log_{a}(A)+\\log_{a}(B)\\).\nNow consider \\((a^{5})^{3}=a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}=a^{5+5+5}=a^{5\\cdot 3}=a^{15}\\). Again it's clear that more generally \\((a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}\\), and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If \\(A=a^{x}\\) then \\(A^{y}=(a^{x})^{y}=a^{xy}\\), so \\(\\log_{a}(A^{y})=xy=y\\log_{a}(A)\\)--the exponent can be \"pulled out in front.\"\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\n\n",

To graph \\(y=1-2\\sec(2x)\\), we follow the same procedure as in Example 10.5.1. First, we set the argument of secant, \\(2x\\), equal to the 'quarter marks' \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) and solve for \\(x\\).\nNext, we substitute these \\(x\\) values into \\(f(x)\\). If \\(f(x)\\) exists, we have a point on the graph; otherwise, we have found a vertical asymptote. In addition to these points and asymptotes, we have graphed the associated cosine curve - in this case \\(y=1-2\\cos(2x)\\) - dotted in the picture below. Since one cycle is graphed over the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\), the period is \\(\\pi-0=\\pi\\).\nOne cycle of \\(y=1-2\\sec(2x)\\).\n2. Proceeding as before, we set the argument of cosecant in \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\csc(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\) equal to the quarter marks and solve for \\(x\\).\nSubstituting these \\(x\\)-values into \\(g(x)\\), we generate the graph below and find the period to be \\(1-(-1)=2\\). The associated sine curve, \\(y=\\frac{\\sin(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\), is dotted in as a reference.\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\n\n",

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\).

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\nWe already know one case, not particularly interesting, in which this theorem is true: If \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, we know that the integral \\(\\oint_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=0\\), because any integral of a conservative vector field around a closed curve is zero. We also know in this case that \\(\\partial P/\\partial y=\\partial Q/\\partial x\\), so the double integral in the theorem is simply the integral of the zero function, namely, \\(0\\). So in the case that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, the theorem says simply that \\(0=0\\).\n**Example 16.4.2**: We illustrate the theorem by computing both sides of\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA,\\]\nwhere \\(D\\) is the triangular region with corners \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\).\nStarting with the double integral:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1-x}y\\,dy\\,dx= \\int_{0}^{1}{(1-x)^{2}\\over 2}\\,dx=\\left.-{(1-x)^{3}\\over 6}\\right|_{0}^{1}={1 \\over 6}.\\]\nThere is no single formula to describe the boundary of \\(D\\), so to compute the left side directly we need to compute three separate integrals corresponding to the three sides of the triangle, and each of these integrals we break into two integrals, the \"\\(dx\\)\" part and the \"\\(dy\\)\" part. The three sides are described by \\(y=0\\), \\(y=1-x\\), and \\(x=0\\). The integrals are then\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{\\partial D}\\!\\!x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0} ^{0}0\\,dy+\\int_{1}^{0}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)y\\,dy+\\int_{0}^{0}0\\,dx+\\int_ {1}^{0}0\\,dy\\cr&={1\\over 5}+0-{1\\over 5}+{1\\over 6}+0+0={1\\over 6}.\\cr}\\]\nAlternately, we could describe the three sides in vector form as \\(\\langle t,0\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1-t,t\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle 0,1-t\\rangle\\). Note that in each case, as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), we follow the corresponding side\nin the correct direction. Now\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}+t\\cdot 0\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt+ \\int_{0}^{1}0+0\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt=\\frac{1}{ 6}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\n\n\n",

Once again, we re-write \\(x^{2}-2x>1\\) as \\(x^{2}-2x-1>0\\) and we identify \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x-1\\). When we go to find the zeros of \\(f\\), we find, to our chagrin, that the quadratic \\(x^{2}-2x-1\\) doesn't factor nicely. Hence, we resort to the quadratic formula to solve \\(x^{2}-2x-1=0\\), and arrive at \\(x=1\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\). As before, these zeros divide the number line into three pieces. To help us decide on test values, we approximate \\(1-\\sqrt{2}\\approx-0.4\\) and \\(1+\\sqrt{2}\\approx 2.4\\). We choose \\(x=-1\\), \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=3\\) as our test values and find \\(f(-1)=2\\), which is \\((+)\\); \\(f(0)=-1\\) which is \\((-)\\); and \\(f(3)=2\\) which is \\((+)\\) again. Our solution to \\(x^{2}-2x-1>0\\) is where we have \\((+)\\), so, in interval notation \\(\\left(-\\infty,1-\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\cup\\left(1+\\sqrt{2},\\infty\\right)\\). To check the inequality \\(x^{2}-2x>1\\) graphically, we set \\(g(x)=x^{2}-2x\\) and \\(h(x)=1\\). We are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(g\\) is above the graph of \\(h\\). As before we present the graphs on the right and the sign chart on the left. 3. To solve \\(x^{2}+1\\leq 2x\\), as before, we solve \\(x^{2}-2x+1\\leq 0\\). Setting \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x+1=0\\), we find the only one zero of \\(f\\), \\(x=1\\). This one \\(x\\) value divides the number line into two intervals, from which we choose \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\) as test values. We find \\(f(0)=1>0\\) and \\(f(2)=1>0\\). Since we are looking for solutions to \\(x^{2}-2x+1\\leq 0\\), we are looking for \\(x\\) values where \\(x^{2}-2x+1<0\\) as well as where \\(x^{2}-2x+1=0\\). Looking at our sign diagram, there are no places where \\(x^{2}-2x+1<0\\) (there are no \\((-)\\)), so our solution is only \\(x=1\\) (where \\(x^{2}-2x+1=0\\)). We write this as \\(\\{1\\}\\). Graphically, we solve \\(x^{2}+1\\leq 2x\\) by graphing \\(g(x)=x^{2}+1\\) and \\(h(x)=2x\\). We are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(g\\) is below the graph of \\(h\\) (for \\(x^{2}+1<2x\\)) and where the two graphs intersect (\\(x^{2}+1=2x\\)). Notice that the line and the parabola touch at \\((1,2)\\), but the parabola is always above the line otherwise.4\n4. To solve our last inequality, \\(2x-x^{2}\\geq|x-1|-1\\), we re-write the absolute value using cases. For \\(x<1\\), \\(|x-1|=-(x-1)=1-x\\), so we get \\(2x-x^{2}\\geq 1-x-1\\), or \\(x^{2}-3x\\leq 0\\). Finding the zeros of \\(f(x)=x^{2}-3x\\), we get \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=3\\). However, we are only concerned with the portion of the number line where \\(x<1\\), so the only zero that we concern ourselves with is \\(x=0\\). This divides the interval \\(x<1\\) into two intervals: \\((-\\infty,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\). We choose \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\) as our test values. We find \\(f(-1)=4\\) and \\(f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=-\\frac{5}{4}\\). Hence, our solution to \\(x^{2}-3x\\leq 0\\) for \\(x<1\\) is \\([0,1)\\). Next, we turn our attention to the case \\(x\\geq 1\\). Here, \\(|x-1|=x-1\\), so our original inequality becomes \\(2x-x^{2}\\geq x-1-1\\), or \\(x^{2}-x-2\\leq 0\\). Setting \\(g(x)=x^{2}-x-2\\), we find the zeros of \\(g\\) to be \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=2\\). Of these, only \\(x=2\\) lies in the region \\(x\\geq 1\\), so we ignore \\(x=-1\\). Our test intervals are now \\([1,2)\\) and \\((2,\\infty)\\). We choose \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3\\) as our test values and find \\(g(1)=-2\\) and \\(g(3)=4\\). Hence, our solution to \\(g(x)=x^{2}-x-2\\leq 0\\), in this region is \\([1,2)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1} \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1} &\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1} \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1 }&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{figure-1 }\\end{array}\\] Combining these into one sign diagram, we have that our solution is \\([0,2]\\).

A vector tangent to this path is given by the derivative \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(r)=\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\), and a small tangent vector, with length approximately equal to the side of the region, is \\(\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr\\). Likewise, if we fix \\(r=r_{0}=0.5\\), we get the vector function \\({\\bf w}(\\theta)=\\langle r_{0}\\cos\\theta,r_{0}\\sin\\theta,0\\rangle\\) with derivative \\({\\bf w}^{\\prime}(\\theta)=\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta,r_{0}\\cos\\theta,0\\rangle\\) and a small tangent vector \\(\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\) when \\(\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) (at the corner we're focusing on). These vectors are shown in figure 15.7.4, with the actual region outlined by a dotted boundary. Of course, since both \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly good approximation to the true area.\nThe area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta \\times\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr&=\\left|\\matrix{\\bf i &\\bf j&\\bf k\\cr-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0}&r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0}&0\\cr\\cos\\theta_{0}& \\sin\\theta_{0}&0\\cr}\\right|\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{0}-r_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr.}\\]\nThe length of this vector is \\(r_{0}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). So in general, for any values of \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), the area in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane corresponding to a small rectangle anchored at \\((\\theta,r)\\) in the \\(r\\)-\\(\\theta\\) plane is approximately \\(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). In other words, \"\\(r\\)\" replaces the \"?\" in equation 15.7.2.\nIn general, a substitution will start with equations \\(x=f(u,v)\\) and \\(y=g(u,v)\\). Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\). The quantity \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\) is usually denoted\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|=|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\]\nand called the **Jacobian**. Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant\n\\[\\left|\\matrix{f_{u}&g_{u}\\cr f_{v}&g_{v}\\cr}\\right|,\\]\nwhich may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the interior of the unit circle. This is still not an easy integral, but it is easily transformed to polar coordinates, and then easily integrated. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 15.7.5**\\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\)\nThere is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals, though it is a bit more difficult to derive. Suppose we use three substitution functions, \\(x=f(u,v,w)\\), \\(y=g(u,v,w)\\), and \\(z=h(u,v,w)\\). The Jacobian determinant is now\n\\[\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u,v,w)}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}f_{u}&g_{u}&h _{u}\\\\ f_{v}&g_{v}&h_{v}\\\\ f_{w}&g_{w}&h_{w}\\end{array}\\right|.\\]\nThen the integral is transformed in a similar fashion:\n\n\n",

Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n3. To graph \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\) using transformations, we start with \\(j(x)=\\log_{2}(x)\\).

Next, we add 1 to the \\(y\\) values on the graph and get \\(\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\), \\(\\left(-2,1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(-1,2\\right)\\). If you are experiencing _deja vu_, there is a good reason for it but we leave it to the reader to determine the source of this uncanny familiarity. We obtain the graph below.

Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWhile these sound very different, it turns out that the two problems are very closely related. We know that \"speed\" is really the derivative by a different name; let's start by translating the second question into something that may be easier to visualize. Suppose that the function \\(f(t)\\) gives the position of your car on the toll road at time \\(t\\). Your change in position between one toll booth and the next is given by \\(f(t_{1})-f(t_{0})\\), assuming that at time \\(t_{0}\\) you were at the first booth and at time \\(t_{1}\\) you arrived at the second booth. Your average speed for the trip is \\((f(t_{1})-f(t_{0}))/(t_{1}-t_{0})\\). If we think about the graph of \\(f(t)\\), the average speed is the slope of the line that connects the two points \\((t_{0},f(t_{0}))\\) and \\((t_{1},f(t_{1}))\\). Your speed at any particular time \\(t\\) between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) is \\(f^{\\prime}(t)\\), the slope of the curve. Now question (2) becomes a question about slope. In particular, if the slope between endpoints is 70, what can be said of the slopes at points between the endpoints?\nAs a general rule, when faced with a new problem it is often a good idea to examine one or more simplified versions of the problem, in the hope that this will lead to an understanding of the original problem. In this case, the problem in its \"slope\" form is somewhat easier to simplify than the original, but equivalent, problem.\nHere is a special instance of the problem. Suppose that \\(f(t_{0})=f(t_{1})\\). Then the two endpoints have the same height and the slope of the line connecting the endpoints is zero. What can we say about the slope between the endpoints? It shouldn't take much experimentation before you are convinced of the truth of this statement: Somewhere\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\nPerhaps remarkably, this special case is all we need to prove the more general one as well.\n**THEOREM 6.5.2 Mean Value Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\) and is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\).

What is the value $c$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nOur last example in the section demonstrates how inequalities can be used to describe regions in the plane, as we saw earlier in Section 1.2.\n**Example 2.4.6**.: Sketch the following relations.\n1. \\(R=\\{(x,y):y>|x|\\}\\)\n2. \\(S=\\{(x,y):y\\leq 2-x^{2}\\}\\)\n3. \\(T=\\{(x,y):|x|<y\\leq 2-x^{2}\\}\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. The relation \\(R\\) consists of all points \\((x,y)\\) whose \\(y\\)-coordinate is greater than \\(|x|\\). If we graph \\(y=|x|\\), then we want all of the points in the plane _above_ the points on the graph. Dotting the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) as we have done before to indicate that the points on the graph itself are not in the relation, we get the shaded region below on the left.\n2. For a point to be in \\(S\\), its \\(y\\)-coordinate must be less than or equal to the \\(y\\)-coordinate on the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). This is the set of all points _below_ or _on_ the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n3. Finally, the relation \\(T\\) takes the points whose \\(y\\)-coordinates satisfy both the conditions given in \\(R\\) and those of \\(S\\). Thus we shade the region between \\(y=|x|\\) and \\(y=2-x^{2}\\), keeping those points on the parabola, but not the points on \\(y=|x|\\). To get an accurate graph, we need to find where these two graphs intersect, so we set \\(|x|=2-x^{2}\\). Proceeding as before, breaking this equation into cases, we get \\(x=-1,1\\).

To solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\), we look for where the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) intersect. These appear to be at the points \\((-1,2)\\) and \\((1,2)\\), so our solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\).\n2. To solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen for the \\(x\\) values less than \\(-1\\) and greater than \\(1\\). Our solution is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n3. To solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\), we look for solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) as well as \\(f(x)>g(x)\\). We solved the former equation and found \\(x=\\pm 1\\). To solve \\(f(x)>g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is above the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\), on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Hence, our solution to \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\).\nWe now turn our attention to solving inequalities involving the absolute value.

Inequalities Involving the Absolute Value:** Let \\(c\\) be a real number.\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\).\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c\\leq x\\leq c\\).\n* For \\(c\\leq 0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) has no solution, and for \\(c<0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) has no solution.\n* For \\(c\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|>c\\) is equivalent to \\(x<-c\\) or \\(x>c\\).\n* For \\(c\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|\\geq c\\) is equivalent to \\(x\\leq-c\\) or \\(x\\geq c\\).\n* For \\(c<0\\), \\(|x|>c\\) and \\(|x|\\geq c\\) are true for all real numbers.\nAs with Theorem 2.1 in Section 2.2, we could argue Theorem 2.4 using cases. However, in light of what we have developed in this section, we can understand these statements graphically. For instance, if \\(c>0\\), the graph of \\(y=c\\) is a horizontal line which lies above the \\(x\\)-axis through \\((0,c)\\). To solve \\(|x|<c\\), we are looking for the \\(x\\) values where the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) is below the graph of \\(y=c\\). We know that the graphs intersect when \\(|x|=c\\), which, from Section 2.2, we know happens when \\(x=c\\) or \\(x=-c\\). Graphing, we get\nWe see that the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) is below \\(y=c\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(-c\\) and \\(c\\), and hence we get \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\). The other properties in Theorem 2.4 can be shown similarly.\n**Example 2.4.3.** Solve the following inequalities analytically; check your answers graphically.\n\n\n",

What is y(\\pi/4)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 17.6 Second Order Linear Equations\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\\[\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=2a-(2at+b)-6(at^{2}+bt+c)=-6at^{2}+(-2a-6b)t+(2a-b-6c).\\]\nWe want this to equal \\(18t^{2}+5\\), so we need\n\\[\\eqalign{-6a&=18\\cr-2a-6b&=0\\cr 2a-b-6c&=5\\cr}\\]\nThis is a system of three equations in three unknowns and is not hard to solve: \\(a=-3\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=-2\\). Thus the general solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}-3t^{2}+t-2\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSo the \"judicious guess\" is a function with the same form as \\(f(t)\\) but with undetermined (or better, yet to be determined) coefficients. This works whenever \\(f(t)\\) is a polynomial.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.2** Consider the initial value problem \\(m\\ddot{y}+ky=-mg\\), \\(y(0)=2\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=50\\). The left hand side represents a mass-spring system with no damping, i.e., \\(b=0\\). Unlike the homogeneous case, we now consider the force due to gravity, \\(-mg\\), assuming the spring is vertical at the surface of the earth, so that \\(g=980\\). To be specific, let us take \\(m=1\\) and \\(k=100\\). The general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)\\). For the solution to the non-homogeneous equation we guess simply a constant \\(y=a\\), since \\(-mg=-980\\) is a constant. Then \\(\\ddot{y}+100y=100a\\) so \\(a=-980/100=-9.8\\). The desired general solution is then \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). Substituting the initial conditions we get\n\\[\\eqalign{2&=A-9.8\\cr 50&=10B\\cr}\\]\nso \\(A=11.8\\) and \\(B=5\\) and the solution is \\(11.8\\cos(10t)+5\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nMore generally, this method can be used when a function similar to \\(f(t)\\) has derivatives that are also similar to \\(f(t)\\); in the examples so far, since \\(f(t)\\) was a polynomial, so were its derivatives. The method will work if \\(f(t)\\) has the form \\(p(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)+q(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)\\), where \\(p(t)\\) and \\(q(t)\\) are polynomials; when \\(\\alpha=\\beta=0\\) this is simply \\(p(t)\\), a polynomial. In the most general form it is not simple to describe the appropriate judicious guess; we content ourselves with some examples to illustrate the process.\n\n\n",

We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\).

To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\).

Now we continue to manipulate this:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+&R\\left({\\partial z\\over \\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt\\cr &=\\int_{a}^{b}\\left[\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right){dx\\over dt}+ \\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right){dy\\over dt}\\right]\\,dt\\cr&=\\int_{ \\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{\\partial z \\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy,}\\]\nwhich now looks just like the line integral of Green's Theorem, except that the functions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) of Green's Theorem have been replaced by the more complicated \\(P+R(\\partial z/\\partial x)\\) and \\(Q+R(\\partial z/\\partial y)\\). We can apply Green's Theorem to get\n\\[\\int_{\\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{ \\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}{\\partial \\over\\partial x}\\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)-{\\partial\\over \\partial y}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dA.\\]\nNow we can use the chain rule again to evaluate the derivatives inside this integral, and it becomes\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}&Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}+R_{z}g_{x}g_{ y}+Rg_{yx}-\\left(P_{y}+P_{z}g_{y}+R_{y}g_{x}+R_{z}g_{y}g_{x}+Rg_{xy}\\right)\\,dA\\cr&= \\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}-P_{y}-P_{z}g_{y}-R_{y}g_ {x}\\,dA,}\\]\nwhich is the same as the expression we obtained for the surface integral.\n### 16 Vector Calculus\n#### Exercises 16.8\n\n\n",

How long until 4200 people have heard the rumor?\n4. Check your answers to 2 and 3 using your calculator.\n**Solution.**\n1. We find \\(N(0)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{0}}=\\frac{84}{2800}=\\frac{3}{100}\\). Since \\(N(t)\\) measures the number of people who have heard the rumor in hundreds, \\(N(0)\\) corresponds to 3 people. Since \\(t=0\\) corresponds to April 1, 2009, we may conclude that on that day, 3 people have heard the rumor.14 Footnote 14: Or, more likely, three people started the rumor. I’d wager Jeff, Jamie, and Jason started it. So much for telling your best friends something in confidence!\n2. We could simply note that \\(N(t)\\) is written in the form of Equation 6.7, and identify \\(L=84\\). However, to see why the answer is 84, we proceed analytically. Since the domain of \\(N\\) is restricted to \\(t\\geq 0\\), the only end behavior of significance is \\(t\\to\\infty\\). As we've seen before,15 as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), we have \\(1997e^{-t}\\to 0^{+}\\) and so \\(N(t)\\approx\\frac{84}{1+\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx 84\\). Hence, as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(N(t)\\to 84\\). This means that as time goes by, the number of people who will have heard the rumor approaches 8400. Footnote 15: See, for example, Example 6.1.2.\n3. To find how long it takes until 4200 people have heard the rumor, we set \\(N(t)=42\\). Solving \\(\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-t}}=42\\) gives \\(t=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\). It takes around 8 days until 4200 people have heard the rumor.\n4. We graph \\(y=N(x)\\) using the calculator and see that the line \\(y=84\\) is the horizontal asymptote of the graph, confirming our answer to part 2, and the graph intersects the line \\(y=42\\) at \\(x=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\), which confirms our answer to part 3.\nIf we take the time to analyze the graph of \\(y=N(x)\\) above, we can see graphically how logistic growth combines features of uninhibited and limited growth. The curve seems to rise steeply, then at some point, begins to level off. The point at which this happens is called an **inflection point** or is sometimes called the 'point of diminishing returns'. At this point, even though the function is still increasing, the rate at which it does so begins to decline. It turns out the point of diminishing returns always occurs at half the limiting population. (In our case, when \\(y=42\\).) While these concepts are more precisely quantified using Calculus, below are two views of the graph of \\(y=N(x)\\), one on the interval \\([0,8]\\), the other on \\([8,15]\\). The former looks strikingly like uninhibited growth; the latter like limited growth.\n\\(y=f(x)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-x}}\\) for \\(0\\leq x\\leq 8\\)\\(y=f(x)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-x}}\\) for \\(8\\leq x\\leq 16\\)\n#### Applications of Logarithms\nJust as many physical phenomena can be modeled by exponential functions, the same is true of logarithmic functions. In Exercises 75, 76 and 77 of Section 6.1, we showed that logarithms are useful in measuring the intensities of earthquakes (the Richter scale), sound (decibels) and acids and bases (pH). We now present yet a different use of the a basic logarithm function, password strength.\n**Example 6.5.6**.: The information entropy \\(H\\), in bits, of a randomly generated password consisting of \\(L\\) characters is given by \\(H=L\\log_{2}(N)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of possible symbols for each character in the password. In general, the higher the entropy, the stronger the password.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nUse the Trapezoidal Rule with to approximate $\\int_0^{\\pi} sin^2(x)dx$. Return the approximated demical value.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe trapezoid approximation works well, especially compared to rectangles, because the tops of the trapezoids form a reasonably good approximation to the curve when \\(\\Delta x\\) is fairly small. We can extend this idea: what if we try to approximate the curve more closely,\nby using something other than a straight line? The obvious candidate is a parabola: if we can approximate a short piece of the curve with a parabola with equation \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), we can easily compute the area under the parabola.\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\). On the calculator, we graph \\(f(x)=2000\\) and \\(g(x)=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1x}\\) and find that they intersect at \\(x=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\approx-6.3093\\).\n3. We first note that we can rewrite the equation \\(9\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) as \\(3^{2}\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) to obtain \\(3^{x+2}=7^{2x}\\). Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other. We then divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which we obtain by factoring. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ x\\ln(3)+2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)-x\\ln(3)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&x(2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3))\\quad\\mbox{Factor}.\\\\ x&=&\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\end{array}\\] Graphing \\(f(x)=9\\cdot 3^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=7^{2x}\\) on the calculator, we see that these two graphs intersect at \\(x=\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\approx 0.7866\\).\n4. Our objective in solving \\(75=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2t}}\\) is to first isolate the exponential. To that end, we clear denominators and get \\(75\\left(1+3e^{-2t}\\right)=100\\). From this we get \\(75+225e^{-2t}=100\\), which leads to \\(225e^{-2t}=25\\), and finally, \\(e^{-2t}=\\frac{1}{9}\\). Taking the natural log of both sides\ngives \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\). Since natural \\(\\log\\) is \\(\\log\\) base \\(e\\), \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=-2t\\). We can also use the Power Rule to write \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=-\\ln(9)\\). Putting these two steps together, we simplify \\(\\ln\\left(e^{-2t}\\right)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\) to \\(-2t=-\\ln(9)\\). We arrive at our solution, \\(t=\\frac{\\ln(9)}{2}\\) which simplifies to \\(t=\\ln(3)\\). (Can you explain why?) The calculator confirms the graphs of \\(f(x)=75\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2x}}\\) intersect at \\(x=\\ln(3)\\approx 1.099\\). 5. We start solving \\(25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\) by rewriting \\(25=5^{2}\\) so that we have \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{x}=5^{x}+6\\), or \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\). Even though we have a common base, having two terms on the right hand side of the equation foils our plan of equating exponents or taking logs. If we stare at this long enough, we notice that we have three terms with the exponent on one term exactly twice that of another. To our surprise and delight, we have a 'quadratic in disguise'. Letting \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(u^{2}=\\left(5^{x}\\right)^{2}=5^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(5^{2x}=5^{x}+6\\) becomes \\(u^{2}=u+6\\). Solving this as \\(u^{2}-u-6=0\\) gives \\(u=-2\\) or \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=5^{x}\\), we have \\(5^{x}=-2\\) or \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since \\(5^{x}=-2\\) has no real solution, (Why not?) we focus on \\(5^{x}=3\\). Since it isn't convenient to express \\(3\\) as a power of \\(5\\), we take natural logs and get \\(\\ln\\left(5^{x}\\right)=\\ln(3)\\) so that \\(x\\ln(5)=\\ln(3)\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\). On the calculator, we see the graphs of \\(f(x)=25^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=5^{x}+6\\) intersect at \\(x=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(5)}\\approx 0.6826\\). 6. At first, it's unclear how to proceed with \\(\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\), besides clearing the denominator to obtain \\(e^{x}-e^{-x}=10\\). Of course, if we rewrite \\(e^{-x}=\\frac{1}{e^{x}}\\), we see we have another denominator lurking in the problem: \\(e^{x}-\\frac{1}{e^{x}}=10\\). Clearing this denominator gives us \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\), and once again, we have an equation with three terms where the exponent on one term is exactly twice that of another - a 'quadratic in disguise.' If we let \\(u=e^{x}\\), then \\(u^{2}=e^{2x}\\) so the equation \\(e^{2x}-1=10e^{x}\\) can be viewed as \\(u^{2}-1=10u\\). Solving \\(u^{2}-10u-1=0\\), we obtain by the quadratic formula \\(u=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). From this, we have \\(e^{x}=5\\pm\\sqrt{26}\\). Since \\(5-\\sqrt{26}<0\\), we get no real solution to \\(e^{x}=5-\\sqrt{26}\\), but for \\(e^{x}=5+\\sqrt{26}\\), we take natural logs to obtain \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\). If we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}\\) and \\(g(x)=5\\), we see that the graphs intersect at \\(x=\\ln\\left(5+\\sqrt{26}\\right)\\approx 2.312\\)\n\n\n",

We say that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(n>N\\), \\(|a_{n}-L|<\\epsilon\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=L\\) we say that the sequence **converges**, otherwise it **diverges**. \\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\).

But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\).

If this looks familiar, it should. Since the dot product enjoys many of the same properties enjoyed by real numbers, the machinations required to expand for vectors for and match those required to expand for real numbers and , and hence we get similar looking results. The identity verified in Example 11.9.1 plays a large role in the development of the geometric properties of the dot product, which we now explore.\nSuppose and are two nonzero vectors. If we draw and with the same initial point, we define the **angle between** and to be the angle determined by the rays containing the vectors and , as illustrated below. We require . (Think about why this is needed in the definition.)\nThe following theorem gives us some insight into the geometric role the dot product plays.\n**Theorem 11.23**.: **Geometric Interpretation of Dot Product:** If and are nonzero vectors then , where is the angle between and .\nWe prove Theorem 11.23 in cases. If \\(\\theta=0\\), then \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) have the same direction. It follows1 that there is a real number \\(k>0\\) so that \\(\\vec{w}=k\\vec{v}\\).

Next, if \\(0<\\theta<\\pi\\), the vectors \\(\\vec{v}\\), \\(\\vec{w}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\) determine a triangle with side lengths \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\), \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|\\), respectively, as seen below.\nFootnote 1: Since \\(\\vec{v}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\hat{w}\\), if \\(\\hat{v}=\\hat{w}\\) then \\(\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\hat{v}=\\frac{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v})= \\frac{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\vec{v}\\). In this case, \\(k=\\frac{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}>0\\).\nThe Law of Cosines yields \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w} \\|\\cos(\\theta)\\). From Example 11.9.1, we know \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\). Equating these two expressions for \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\) gives \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=\\|\\vec{v} \\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\) which reduces to \\(-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})\\), or \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\), as required. An immediate consequence of Theorem 11.23 is the following.\n**Theorem 11.24**.: Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors and let \\(\\theta\\) the angle between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\). Then\n\\[\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right) =\\arccos(\\hat{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\]\nWe obtain the formula in Theorem 11.24 by solving the equation given in Theorem 11.23 for \\(\\theta\\). Since \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero, so are \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Hence, we may divide both sides of \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\) by \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) to get \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\). Since \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) by definition, the values of \\(\\theta\\) exactly match the range of the arccosine function. Hence, \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\). Using Theorem 11.22, we can rewrite \\(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\| }\\vec{v}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\vec{w}\\right)=\\hat{v}\\cdot \\hat{w}\\), giving us the alternative formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos(\\hat{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\).\nWe are overdue for an example.\n**Example 11.9.2**.: Find the angle between the following pairs of vectors.\n\n\n",

(This is exactly what I did in the example: I picked \\(\\delta=0.0000002<0.0000002040816327\\ldots\\).) A similar calculation again works for negative \\(\\Delta x\\). The important fact is that this is now a completely general result--it shows that I can always win, no matter what \"move\" you make.\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like \"the limit of \\((-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2})/\\Delta x\\) as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to zero is \\(-19.6\\),\" and abbreviate this mouthful\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\nAs is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing that under certain circumstances \\(x+4\\) is close to \\(6\\); precisely, we want to show that \\(|x+4-6|<\\epsilon\\), or \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\). So the question becomes: can we choose a value for \\(\\delta\\) that\n\n\n",

If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFigure 8.6.3: A parabola (dashed) approximating a curve (solid). (AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\n\n",

A vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) gives the position of a point in terms of the parameter \\(t\\), which is often time, but need not be. Suppose \\(s\\) is the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use \\(s\\) for the variable, we get \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), the position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has traveled.\n##### Example 13.3.3\nSuppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,0\\rangle\\). We know that this curve is a circle of radius 1. While \\(t\\) might represent time, it can also in this case represent the usual angle between the positive \\(x\\)-axis and \\({\\bf r}(t)\\). The distance along the circle from \\((1,0,0)\\) to\n\\((\\cos t,\\sin t,0)\\) is also \\(t\\)--this is the definition of radian measure.

What is the limit of $I(R)$ as $R$ goes to infinity?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf all of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the terms \\(a_{n}\\) approach zero, but this does not mean that \\(a_{n}\\geq a_{n+1}\\) for every \\(n\\). Many useful and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to understand. Let's look at an example.\n##### Example 11.3.1\nShow that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges.\nThe terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) are positive and decreasing, and since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1/x^{2}=0\\), the terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number \\(N\\) so that \\(s_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\). The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is inherent in figure 11.\nThe figure shows the graph of \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\narea under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areas is less than the area under the entire curve, that is, all the way to infinity. There is a bit of trouble at the left end, where there is an asymptote, but we can work around that easily. Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe already know that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\nThe rectangles this time are above the curve, that is, each rectangle completely contains the corresponding area under the curve. This means that\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}>\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1 \\over x}\\,dx=\\ln x\\Big{|}_{1}^{n+1}=\\ln(n+1).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets bigger, \\(\\ln(n+1)\\) goes to infinity, so the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) must also go to infinity, so the harmonic series diverges. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\\[{d\\over dx}x={d\\over dx}e^{y}.\\]\nThen using the chain rule on the right hand side:\n\\[1=\\left({d\\over dx}y\\right)e^{y}=y^{\\prime}e^{y}.\\]\nThen we can solve for \\(y^{\\prime}\\):\n\\[y^{\\prime}={1\\over e^{y}}={1\\over x}.\\]\nThere is one little difficulty here. To use the chain rule to compute \\(d/dx(e^{y})=y^{\\prime}e^{y}\\) we need to know that the function \\(y\\)_has_ a derivative. All we have shown is that _if_ it has a derivative then that derivative must be \\(1/x\\). When using this method we will always have to assume that the desired derivative exists, but fortunately this is a safe assumption for most such problems.\nThe example \\(y=\\ln x\\) involved an inverse function defined implicitly, but other functions can be defined implicitly, and sometimes a single equation can be used to implicitly define more than one function. Here's a familiar example. The equation \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) describes a circle of radius \\(r\\). The circle is not a function \\(y=f(x)\\) because for some values of \\(x\\) there are two corresponding values of \\(y\\). If we want to work with a function, we can break the circle into two pieces, the upper and lower semicircles, each of which is a function. Let's call these \\(y=U(x)\\) and \\(y=L(x)\\); in fact this is a fairly simple example, and it's possible to give explicit expressions for these: \\(U(x)=\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) and \\(L(x)=-\\sqrt{r^{2}-x^{2}}\\) . But it's somewhat easier, and quite useful, to view both functions as given implicitly by \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\): both \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+U(x)^{2}\\) and \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+L(x)^{2}\\) are true, and we can think of \\(r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) as defining both \\(U(x)\\) and \\(L(x)\\).\nNow we can take the derivative of both sides as before, remembering that \\(y\\) is not simply a variable but a function--in this case, \\(y\\) is either \\(U(x)\\) or \\(L(x)\\) but we're not yet specifying which one. When we take the derivative we just have to remember to apply the\n\n\n",

There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,\nbut the second approach works fine. (Because the function \\(y=3x\\) is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and \\(x\\) into \\(n\\) equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let's use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1. The height of rectangle number \\(i\\) is then \\(3(i-1)(x/n)\\), the width is \\(x/n\\), and the area is \\(3(i-1)(x^{2}/n^{2})\\).

As we will see, there\nare many, many problems that appear much different on the surface but that turn out to be the same as these problems, in the sense that when we try to approximate solutions we end up with mathematics that looks like the two examples, though of course the function involved will not always be so simple.\n\n\n",

Not surprisingly, non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more general equations.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) is a function of two variables. A more general class of first order differential equations has the form \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\). This is not necessarily a linear first order equation, since \\(\\phi\\) may depend on \\(y\\) in some complicated way; note however that \\(\\dot{y}\\) appears in a very simple form. Under suitable conditions on the function \\(\\phi\\), it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable property.\n##### Example 17.4.1\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\) is a first order non-linear equation, because \\(y\\) appears to the second power. We will not be able to solve this equation. \\(\\Box\\)\n##### Example 17.4.2\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\nNot all differential equations that are important in practice can be solved exactly, so techniques have been developed to approximate solutions. We describe one such technique, **Euler's Method**, which is simple though not particularly useful compared to some more sophisticated techniques.\nSuppose we wish to approximate a solution to the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\), \\(y(t_{0})=y_{0}\\), for \\(t\\geq t_{0}\\). Under reasonable conditions on \\(\\phi\\), we know the solution exists, represented by a curve in the \\(t\\)-\\(y\\) plane; call this solution \\(f(t)\\). The point \\((t_{0},y_{0})\\) is of course on this curve. We also know the slope of the curve at this point, namely \\(\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\). If we follow the tangent line for a brief distance, we arrive at a point that should be almost on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), namely \\((t_{0}+\\Delta t,y_{0}+\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\Delta t)\\); call this point \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). Now we pretend, in effect, that this point really is on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), in which case we again know the slope of the curve through \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\), namely \\(\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\). So we can compute a new point, \\((t_{2},y_{2})=(t_{1}+\\Delta t,y_{1}+\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\Delta t)\\) that is a little farther along, still close to the graph of \\(f(t)\\) but probably not quite so close as \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). We can continue in this way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have an approximation \\((t_{n},y_{n})\\) for whatever time \\(t_{n}\\) we need. At each step we do essentially the same calculation, namely\n\\[(t_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(t_{i}+\\Delta t,y_{i}+\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\Delta t).\\]\nWe expect that smaller time steps \\(\\Delta t\\) will give better approximations, but of course it will require more work to compute to a specified time. It is possible to compute a guaranteed\nupper bound on how far off the approximation might be, that is, how far \\(y_{n}\\) is from \\(f(t_{n})\\). Suffice it to say that the bound is not particularly good and that there are other more complicated approximation techniques that do better.\n\n\n",

But really there's nothing special about \\(t=1\\); let's just call it \\(t\\) instead. In this case the approximate distance traveled during time interval number \\(i\\) is \\(3(i-1)(t/n)(t/n)=3(i-1)t^{2}/n^{2}\\), that is, speed \\(3(i-1)(t/n)\\) times time \\(t/n\\), and the total distance traveled is approximately\n\\[(0){t\\over n}+3(1){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}+3(2){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}+3(3){t^{2}\\over n ^{2}}+\\cdots+3(n-1){t^{2}\\over n^{2}}.\\]\nAs before we can simplify this to\n\\[{3t^{2}\\over n^{2}}(0+1+2+\\cdots+(n-1))={3t^{2}\\over n^{2}}{n^{2}-n\\over 2}={3 \\over 2}t^{2}\\left(1-{1\\over n}\\right).\\]\nIn the limit, as \\(n\\) gets larger, this gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}\\) and the approximated position of the object gets closer and closer to \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), so the actual position is \\((3/2)t^{2}+10\\), exactly the answer given by the first approach to the problem. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 7.1.2** Find the area under the curve \\(y=3x\\) between \\(x=0\\) and any positive value \\(x\\). There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example,\nbut the second approach works fine. (Because the function \\(y=3x\\) is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles. Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and \\(x\\) into \\(n\\) equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many ways we might do this, but let's use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the height of the rectangle, as in figure 7.1.1. The height of rectangle number \\(i\\) is then \\(3(i-1)(x/n)\\), the width is \\(x/n\\), and the area is \\(3(i-1)(x^{2}/n^{2})\\).

Drag the slider to change the number of rectangles.\nWhat you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example appears to be much different than the problem in the first example, and while the easy approach to problem one does not appear to apply to problem two, the \"approximation\" approach works in both, and moreover the _calculations are identical_. As we will see, there\nare many, many problems that appear much different on the surface but that turn out to be the same as these problems, in the sense that when we try to approximate solutions we end up with mathematics that looks like the two examples, though of course the function involved will not always be so simple.\n\n\n",

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function.

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\nWe already know one case, not particularly interesting, in which this theorem is true: If \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, we know that the integral \\(\\oint_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=0\\), because any integral of a conservative vector field around a closed curve is zero. We also know in this case that \\(\\partial P/\\partial y=\\partial Q/\\partial x\\), so the double integral in the theorem is simply the integral of the zero function, namely, \\(0\\). So in the case that \\({\\bf F}\\) is conservative, the theorem says simply that \\(0=0\\).\n**Example 16.4.2**: We illustrate the theorem by computing both sides of\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA,\\]\nwhere \\(D\\) is the triangular region with corners \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,0)\\), \\((0,1)\\).\nStarting with the double integral:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}y-0\\,dA=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1-x}y\\,dy\\,dx= \\int_{0}^{1}{(1-x)^{2}\\over 2}\\,dx=\\left.-{(1-x)^{3}\\over 6}\\right|_{0}^{1}={1 \\over 6}.\\]\nThere is no single formula to describe the boundary of \\(D\\), so to compute the left side directly we need to compute three separate integrals corresponding to the three sides of the triangle, and each of these integrals we break into two integrals, the \"\\(dx\\)\" part and the \"\\(dy\\)\" part. The three sides are described by \\(y=0\\), \\(y=1-x\\), and \\(x=0\\). The integrals are then\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{\\partial D}\\!\\!x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy&=\\int_{0}^{1}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0} ^{0}0\\,dy+\\int_{1}^{0}x^{4}\\,dx+\\int_{0}^{1}(1-y)y\\,dy+\\int_{0}^{0}0\\,dx+\\int_ {1}^{0}0\\,dy\\cr&={1\\over 5}+0-{1\\over 5}+{1\\over 6}+0+0={1\\over 6}.\\cr}\\]\nAlternately, we could describe the three sides in vector form as \\(\\langle t,0\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1-t,t\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle 0,1-t\\rangle\\). Note that in each case, as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\), we follow the corresponding side\nin the correct direction. Now\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}x^{4}\\,dx+xy\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}+t\\cdot 0\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt+ \\int_{0}^{1}0+0\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{1}t^{4}\\,dt+\\int_{0}^{1}-(1-t)^{4}+(1-t)t\\,dt=\\frac{1}{ 6}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\n\n\n",

Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it).

This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\nThe first two terms in parentheses are zero because \\(y_{1}\\) and \\(y_{2}\\) are solutions to the associated homogeneous equation. Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\nIf we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get\n\\[\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t\\] \\[\\dot{v} =e^{-3t}\\sin t\\] \\[v =-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-3t},\\]\nusing integration by parts. Then from the first equation:\n\\[\\dot{u} =-e^{-2t}\\dot{v}e^{3t}=-e^{-2t}e^{-3t}\\sin(t)e^{3t}=-e^{-2t}\\sin t\\] \\[u =\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-2t}.\\]\n### Second Order Linear Equations, take two\nNow the particular solution we seek is\n\\[ue^{2t}+ve^{3t} =\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-2t}e^{2t}-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t )e^{-3t}e^{3t}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{5}(2\\sin t+\\cos t)-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{10}(\\sin t+\\cos t),\\]\nand the solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}+(\\sin t+\\cos t)/10\\). For comparison (and practice) you might want to solve this using the method of undetermined coefficients. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

While we shall not have much need of these properties in Algebra, they do play a great role in Calculus. Moreover, there is much to be learned by thinking about why the properties hold. We invite the reader to prove these results. To get started, remember, \"When in doubt, write it out!\"\n**Theorem 9.1**.: **Properties of Summation Notation:** Suppose \\(\\{a_{n}\\}\\) and \\(\\{b_{n}\\}\\) are sequences so that the following sums are defined.\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}\\left(a_{n}\\pm b_{n}\\right)=\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}\\pm \\sum_{n=m}^{p}b_{n}\\)\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}c\\,a_{n}=c\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}\\), for any real number \\(c\\).\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}=\\sum_{n=m}^{j}a_{n}+\\sum_{n=j+1}^{p}a_{n}\\), for any natural number \\(m\\leq j<j+1\\leq p\\).\n* \\(\\sum_{n=m}^{p}a_{n}=\\sum_{n=m+r}^{p+r}a_{n-r}\\), for any whole number \\(r\\).\nWe now turn our attention to the sums involving arithmetic and geometric sequences. Given an arithmetic sequence \\(a_{k}=a+(k-1)d\\) for \\(k\\geq 1\\), we let \\(S\\) denote the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms. To derive a formula for \\(S\\), we write it out in two different ways\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}S&=&a&+&(a+d)&+&\\ldots&+&(a+(n-2)d)&+&(a+(n-1)d) \\\\ S&=&(a+(n-1)d)&+&(a+(n-2)d)&+&\\ldots&+&(a+d)&+&a\\end{array}\\]\nIf we add these two equations and combine the terms which are aligned vertically, we get\n\\[2S=(2a+(n-1)d)+(2a+(n-1)d)+\\ldots+(2a+(n-1)d)+(2a+(n-1)d)\\]\nThe right hand side of this equation contains \\(n\\) terms, all of which are equal to \\((2a+(n-1)d)\\) so we get \\(2S=n(2a+(n-1)d)\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2, we obtain the formula\n\\[S=\\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)\\]\nIf we rewrite the quantity \\(2a+(n-1)d\\) as \\(a+(a+(n-1)d)=a_{1}+a_{n}\\), we get the formula\n\\[S=n\\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}\\right)\\]\nA helpful way to remember this last formula is to recognize that we have expressed the sum as the product of the number of terms \\(n\\) and the _average_ of the first and \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) terms.\nTo derive the formula for the geometric sum, we start with a geometric sequence \\(a_{k}=ar^{k-1}\\), \\(k\\geq 1\\), and let \\(S\\) once again denote the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms.

Since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\), we can find the domain of \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\) by setting the argument of the arccosine, in this case \\(\\frac{x}{5}\\), between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). Solving \\(-1\\leq\\frac{x}{5}\\leq 1\\) gives \\(-5\\leq x\\leq 5\\), so the domain is \\([-5,5]\\). To determine the range of \\(f\\), we take a cue from Section 1.7. Three 'key' points on the graph of \\(F(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) are \\((-1,\\pi)\\), \\(\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) and \\((1,0)\\) . Following the procedure outlined in Theorem 1.7, we track these points to \\(\\left(-5,-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,0)\\) and \\(\\left(5,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Plotting these values tells us that the range5 of \\(f\\) is \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\). Our graph confirms our results. Footnote 5: It also confirms our domain!\n2. To find the domain and range of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\), we note that since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x\\) is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers. To determine the range of \\(f\\), we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7. Choosing our 'key' point to be \\((0,0)\\) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we find that the graph of \\(y=f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) differs from the graph of \\(y=F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) by a horizontal compression by a factor of \\(4\\) and a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\). It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of \\(\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We confirm our findings on the calculator below. 3. To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\nHence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(g(x)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi\\). What about \\(x=0\\)? We know \\(g(0)=\\operatorname{arccot}(0)+\\pi=\\pi\\), and neither of the formulas for \\(g\\) involving arctangent will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph \\(y=g(x)\\) on our calculators, we need to write it as a piecewise defined function:\nFootnote 6: Without Calculus, of course ...\n\\[g(x)=\\operatorname{arccot}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[] {rl}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi,&\\text{if }x<0\\\\ \\pi,&\\text{if }x=0\\\\ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi,&\\text{if }x>0\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n\n\n",

The associated sine curve, \\(y=\\frac{\\sin(\\pi-\\pi x)-5}{3}\\), is dotted in as a reference.\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) as read from the graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.\nThe properties of the tangent and cotangent functions are summarized below. As with Theorem 10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.\n**Theorem 10.25**. **Properties of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions**\n\n\n",

The complication in solving an equation like \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=4\\) comes not from the argument of secant, which is just \\(x\\), but rather, the fact the secant is being squared. To get this equation to look like one of the forms listed on page 857, we extract square roots to get \\(\\sec(x)=\\pm 2\\). Converting to cosines, we have \\(\\cos(x)=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\). For \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). For \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). If we take a step back and think of these families of solutions geometrically, we see we are finding the measures of all angles with a reference angle of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). As a result, these solutions can be combined and we may write our solutions as \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of solutions, we note that, depending on the integer \\(k\\), \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right)\\) doesn't always equal \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\). However, it is true that for all integers \\(k\\), \\(\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right)=\\pm\\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\pm 2\\). (Can you show this?) As a result, \\[\\sec^{2}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\right) = \\left(\\pm\\sec\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\] \\[= (\\pm 2)^{2}\\] \\[= 4\\] The same holds for the family \\(x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\). The solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) come from the values \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\), namely \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). To confirm graphically, we use\na reciprocal identity to rewrite the secant as cosine. The \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=4\\) verify our answers. \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=0}\\)\\(y=\\frac{1}{\\cos^{2}(x)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=4}\\)\n5. The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check, we note \\[\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of tangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= -3\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2})}\\] To determine which of our answers lie in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we first need to get an idea of the value of \\(2\\arctan(-3)\\). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\). Since this is outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we discard \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\) and all solutions of the form \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for \\(k>2\\).

The graphing calculator furnishes the following.\nThis suggests4 that the graph of \\(f\\) is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis, as expected.\nFootnote 4: ‘Suggests’ is about the extent of what it can do.\n2. \\[g(x) = \\frac{5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[g(-x) = \\frac{5(-x)}{2-(-x)^{2}}\\] \\[g(-x) = \\frac{-5x}{2-x^{2}}\\]\nIt doesn't appear that \\(g(-x)\\) is equivalent to \\(g(x)\\). To prove this, we check with an \\(x\\) value. After some trial and error, we see that \\(g(1)=5\\) whereas \\(g(-1)=-5\\). This proves that \\(g\\) is not even, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that \\(g\\) is odd. (Why not?) To check if \\(g\\) is odd, we compare \\(g(-x)\\) with \\(-g(x)\\)\n\\[-g(x) = -\\frac{5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[= \\frac{-5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[-g(x) = g(-x)\\]\nHence, \\(g\\) is odd.

We check with an \\(x\\) value, for example, \\(h(1)=5\\) but \\(h(-1)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\). This proves that \\(h\\) is not even and it also shows \\(h\\) is not odd. (Why?) Graphically,\nThe graph of \\(h\\) appears to be neither symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis nor the origin.\n4. \\[i(x) = \\frac{5x}{2x-x^{3}}\\] \\[i(-x) = \\frac{5(-x)}{2(-x)-(-x)^{3}}\\] \\[i(-x) = \\frac{-5x}{-2x+x^{3}}\\]\nThe expression \\(i(-x)\\) doesn't appear to be equivalent to \\(i(x)\\). However, after checking some \\(x\\) values, for example \\(x=1\\) yields \\(i(1)=5\\) and \\(i(-1)=5\\), it appears that \\(i(-x)\\) does, in fact, equal \\(i(x)\\). However, while this suggests \\(i\\) is even, it doesn't prove it. (It does, however, prove\n\\(i\\) is not odd.) To prove \\(i(-x)=i(x)\\), we need to manipulate our expressions for \\(i(x)\\) and \\(i(-x)\\) and show that they are equivalent. A clue as to how to proceed is in the numerators: in the formula for \\(i(x)\\), the numerator is \\(5x\\) and in \\(i(-x)\\) the numerator is \\(-5x\\). To re-write \\(i(x)\\) with a numerator of \\(-5x\\), we need to multiply its numerator by \\(-1\\). To keep the value of the fraction the same, we need to multiply the denominator by \\(-1\\) as well. Thus \\[i(x) = \\frac{5x}{2x-x^{3}}\\] \\[= \\frac{(-1)5x}{(-1)\\left(2x-x^{3}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{-5x}{-2x+x^{3}}\\] Hence, \\(i(x)=i(-x)\\), so \\(i\\) is even. The calculator supports our conclusion.\nThe expression \\(-j(x)\\) doesn't seem to match \\(j(-x)\\) either. Testing \\(x=2\\) gives \\(j(2)=\\frac{149}{50}\\) and \\(j(-2)=\\frac{151}{50}\\), so \\(j\\) is not odd, either. The calculator gives:\nThe calculator suggests that the graph of \\(j\\) is symmetric about the \\(y\\)-axis which would imply that \\(j\\) is even. However, we have proven that is not the case.\n\n\n",

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\\[{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}>r\\quad{\\tenrm and}\\quad|a_{n+1}|>r|a_{n}|.\\]\nThis implies that \\(|a_{N+k}|>r^{k}|a_{N}|\\), but since \\(r>1\\) this means that \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}|a_{N+k}|\\neq 0\\), which means also that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}\\neq 0\\). By the divergence test, the series diverges.\nTo see that we get no information when \\(L=1\\), we need to exhibit two series with \\(L=1\\), one that converges and one that diverges. It is easy to see that \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) and \\(\\sum 1/n\\) do the job.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.2**  The ratio test is particularly useful for series involving the factorial function. Consider \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}5^{n}/n!\\).\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1}\\over(n+1)!}{n!\\over 5^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{5^{n+1} \\over 5^{n}}{n!\\over(n+1)!}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}5{1\\over(n+1)}=0.\\]\nSince \\(0<1\\), the series converges.\nA similar argument, which we will not do, justifies a similar test that is occasionally easier to apply.\n**THEOREM 11.7.3 The Root Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n}=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\nThe proof of the root test is actually easier than that of the ratio test, and is a good exercise.\n**EXAMPLE 11.7.4**  Analyze \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}{5^{n}\\over n^{n}}\\).\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nThe ratio test turns out to be a bit difficult on this series (try it).

Here we explore another such application.\nRecall that the tangent line to \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x=a\\) is given by \\(L(x)=f^{\\prime}(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\). The tangent line in this context is also called the **linear approximation** to \\(f\\) at \\(a\\).\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\nFigure 6.4.1: The linear approximation to \\(y=x^{2}\\).\nfunctions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.\n##### Example 6.4.2\nConsider the trigonometric function \\(\\sin x\\). Its linear approximation at \\(x=0\\) is simply \\(L(x)=x\\). When \\(x\\) is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.\n##### Definition 6.4.3\nLet \\(y=f(x)\\) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable \\(dx\\), and a new dependent variable \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\). Notice that \\(dy\\) is a function both of \\(x\\) (since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is a function of \\(x\\)) and of \\(dx\\). We say that \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are **differentials**.\n_Remark._ Up until now, \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) made sense only together, as \\(dy/dx\\), another way to write \\(f^{\\prime}\\). Now we have given them have individual meanings, but notice that since \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\), \\(dy/dx=f^{\\prime}(x)\\), so the new meanings are consistent with the former usage.\nLet \\(\\Delta x=x-a\\) and \\(\\Delta y=f(x)-f(a)\\). If \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\) then \\(\\Delta x\\) is small. If we set \\(dx=\\Delta x\\) then\n\\[dy=f^{\\prime}(a)\\,dx\\approx\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\Delta x=\\Delta y.\\]\nThus, \\(dy\\) can be used to approximate \\(\\Delta y\\), the actual change in the function \\(f\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). This is exactly the approximation given by the tangent line:\n\n\n",

The minimum value of \\(f\\) is the smallest \\(y\\)-coordinate which is \\(-3\\).\nWith few exceptions, we will not develop techniques in College Algebra which allow us to determine the intervals on which a function is increasing, decreasing or constant or to find the local maximums and local minimums analytically; this is the business of Calculus.15 When we have need to find such beasts, we will resort to the calculator. Most graphing calculators have 'Minimum' and 'Maximum' features which can be used to approximate these values, as we now demonstrate.\nFootnote 15: Although, truth be told, there is only one step of Calculus involved, followed by several pages of algebra.\n**Example 1.6.5**.: Let \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{15x}{x^{2}+3}\\). Use a graphing calculator to approximate the intervals on which \\(f\\) is increasing and those on which it is decreasing. Approximate all extrema.\n**Solution.** Entering this function into the calculator gives\nUsing the Minimum and Maximum features, we get\nTo two decimal places, \\(f\\) appears to have its only local minimum at \\((-1.73,-4.33)\\) and its only local maximum at \\((1.73,4.33)\\). Given the symmetry about the origin suggested by the graph, the relation between these points shouldn't be too surprising. The function appears to be increasing on \\([-1.73,1.73]\\) and decreasing on \\((-\\infty,-1.73]\\cup[1.73,\\infty)\\). This makes \\(-4.33\\) the (absolute) minimum and \\(4.33\\) the (absolute) maximum.\n**Example 1.6.6**.: Find the points on the graph of \\(y=(x-3)^{2}\\) which are closest to the origin. Round your answers to two decimal places.\n**Solution.** Suppose a point \\((x,y)\\) is on the graph of \\(y=(x-3)^{2}\\).

What we have defined, then, is a function \\(d(x)\\) which we wish to\nminimize over all values of \\(x\\). To accomplish this task analytically would require Calculus so as we've mentioned before, we can use a graphing calculator to find an approximate solution.

We begin solving \\(2\\sin(x)\\leq 1\\) by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and zero on the other to get \\(2\\sin(x)-1\\leq 0\\). Next, we let \\(f(x)=2\\sin(x)-1\\) and note that our original inequality is equivalent to solving \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\). We now look to see where, if ever, \\(f\\) is undefined and where \\(f(x)=0\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, we can immediately set about finding the zeros of \\(f\\). Solving \\(f(x)=0\\), we have \\(2\\sin(x)-1=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). The solutions here are \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since we are restricting our attention to \\([0,2\\pi)\\), only \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) are of concern to us. Next, we choose test values in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) other than the zeros and determine if \\(f\\) is positive or negative there. For \\(x=0\\) we have \\(f(0)=-1\\), for \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) and for \\(x=\\pi\\) we get \\(f(\\pi)=-1\\). Since our original inequality is equivalent to \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\), we are looking for where the function is negative \\((-)\\) or \\(0\\), and we get the intervals \\(\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right]\\cup\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{6},2\\pi\\right)\\). We can confirm our answer graphically by seeing where the graph of \\(y=2\\sin(x)\\) crosses or is below the graph of \\(y=1\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.\nour test values. For \\(x=0\\) we find \\(f(0)=-1\\); when \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\); for \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)=-1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-2}{2}\\); when \\(x=\\pi\\) we have \\(f(\\pi)=1\\), and lastly, for \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)=-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{-2-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). We see \\(f(x)>0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), so this is our answer. We can use the calculator to check that the graph of \\(y=\\sin(2x)\\) is indeed above the graph of \\(y=\\cos(x)\\) on those intervals. 3. Proceeding as in the last two problems, we rewrite \\(\\tan(x)\\geq 3\\) as \\(\\tan(x)-3\\geq 0\\) and let \\(f(x)=\\tan(x)-3\\). We note that on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), \\(f\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), so those values will need the usual disclaimer on the sign diagram.11 Moving along to zeros, solving \\(f(x)=\\tan(x)-3=0\\) requires the arctangent function. We find \\(x=\\arctan(3)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\) and of these, only \\(x=\\arctan(3)\\) and \\(x=\\arctan(3)+\\pi\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Since \\(3>0\\), we know \\(0<\\arctan(3)<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) which allows us to position these zeros correctly on the sign diagram. To choose test values, we begin with \\(x=0\\) and find \\(f(0)=-3\\). Finding a convenient test value in the interval \\(\\left(\\arctan(3),\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) is a bit more challenging. Keep in mind that the arctangent function is increasing and is bounded above by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). This means that the number \\(x=\\arctan(117)\\) is guaranteed12 to lie between \\(\\arctan(3)\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). We see that \\(f(\\arctan(117))=\\tan(\\arctan(117))-3=114\\). For our next test value, we take \\(x=\\pi\\) and find \\(f(\\pi)=-3\\). To find our next test value, we note that since \\(\\arctan(3)<\\arctan(117)<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), it follows13 that \\(\\arctan(3)+\\pi<\\arctan(117)+\\pi<\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Evaluating \\(f\\) at \\(x=\\arctan(117)+\\pi\\) yields \\(f(\\arctan(117)+\\pi)=\\tan(\\arctan(117)+\\pi)-3=\\tan(\\arctan(117))-3=114\\). We choose our last test value to be \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) and find \\(f\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)=-4\\). Since we want \\(f(x)\\geq 0\\), we see that our answer is \\(\\left[\\arctan(3),\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cup\\left[\\arctan(3)+\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Using the graphs of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) and \\(y=3\\), we see when the graph of the former is above (or meets) the graph of the latter. [FOOTNOTE:13]\n\n\n",

The solutions to \\(\\cos(u)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) are \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation.

To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n3. Since \\(\\cot(3x)=0\\) has the form \\(\\cot(u)=0\\), we know \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\), so, in this case, \\(3x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) yields \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}k\\). Checking our answers, we get \\[\\cot\\left(3\\left[\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}+\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}k\\right]\\right) = \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of cotangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= 0\\] As \\(k\\) runs through the integers, we obtain six answers, corresponding to \\(k=0\\) through \\(k=5\\), which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\,\\frac{5\\pi}{6},\\,\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\) , \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}\\). To confirm these graphically, we must be careful. On many calculators, there is no function button for cotangent. We choose4 to use the quotient identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(3x)}{\\sin(3x)}\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis), we see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points approximately match our solutions. Footnote 4: The reader is encouraged to see what happens if we had chosen the reciprocal identity \\(\\cot(3x)=\\frac{1}{\\tan(3x)}\\) instead.

What is y(2)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 17.6 Second Order Linear Equations\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n**Example 17.6.1**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=18t^{2}+5\\). The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nSubstituting this guess into the differential equation we get\n\\[\\ddot{y}-\\dot{y}-6y=2a-(2at+b)-6(at^{2}+bt+c)=-6at^{2}+(-2a-6b)t+(2a-b-6c).\\]\nWe want this to equal \\(18t^{2}+5\\), so we need\n\\[\\eqalign{-6a&=18\\cr-2a-6b&=0\\cr 2a-b-6c&=5\\cr}\\]\nThis is a system of three equations in three unknowns and is not hard to solve: \\(a=-3\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=-2\\). Thus the general solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}-3t^{2}+t-2\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSo the \"judicious guess\" is a function with the same form as \\(f(t)\\) but with undetermined (or better, yet to be determined) coefficients. This works whenever \\(f(t)\\) is a polynomial.\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.2** Consider the initial value problem \\(m\\ddot{y}+ky=-mg\\), \\(y(0)=2\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=50\\). The left hand side represents a mass-spring system with no damping, i.e., \\(b=0\\). Unlike the homogeneous case, we now consider the force due to gravity, \\(-mg\\), assuming the spring is vertical at the surface of the earth, so that \\(g=980\\). To be specific, let us take \\(m=1\\) and \\(k=100\\). The general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)\\). For the solution to the non-homogeneous equation we guess simply a constant \\(y=a\\), since \\(-mg=-980\\) is a constant. Then \\(\\ddot{y}+100y=100a\\) so \\(a=-980/100=-9.8\\). The desired general solution is then \\(A\\cos(10t)+B\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). Substituting the initial conditions we get\n\\[\\eqalign{2&=A-9.8\\cr 50&=10B\\cr}\\]\nso \\(A=11.8\\) and \\(B=5\\) and the solution is \\(11.8\\cos(10t)+5\\sin(10t)-9.8\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nMore generally, this method can be used when a function similar to \\(f(t)\\) has derivatives that are also similar to \\(f(t)\\); in the examples so far, since \\(f(t)\\) was a polynomial, so were its derivatives. The method will work if \\(f(t)\\) has the form \\(p(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t)+q(t)e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)\\), where \\(p(t)\\) and \\(q(t)\\) are polynomials; when \\(\\alpha=\\beta=0\\) this is simply \\(p(t)\\), a polynomial. In the most general form it is not simple to describe the appropriate judicious guess; we content ourselves with some examples to illustrate the process.\n\n\n",

How can we prove that the limit is zero? Suppose that \\(N\\) is larger than \\(|x|\\), and let \\(M\\) be the largest integer less than \\(|x|\\) (if \\(M=0\\) the following is even easier). Then\n\\[\\frac{|x^{N+1}|}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\frac{|x|}{N}\\frac{|x|}{N-1}\\cdots\\frac{|x|}{M+1} \\frac{|x|}{M}\\frac{|x|}{M-1}\\cdots\\frac{|x|}{2}\\frac{|x|}{1}\\] \\[\\leq \\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\cdot 1\\cdot 1\\cdots 1\\cdot\\frac{|x|}{M}\\frac{|x|}{M- 1}\\cdots\\frac{|x|}{2}\\frac{|x|}{1}\\] \\[= \\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\frac{|x|^{M}}{M!}.\\]\nThe quantity \\(|x|^{M}/M!\\) is a constant, so\n\\[\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{|x|}{N+1}\\frac{|x|^{M}}{M!}=0\\]\nFigure 11.11.1 \\(\\sin x\\) and a polynomial approximation.

Essentially the same argument works for \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\); unfortunately, it is more difficult to show that most functions are equal to their Maclaurin series.\n**EXAMPLE 11.11.3** Find a polynomial approximation for \\(e^{x}\\) near \\(x=2\\) accurate to \\(\\pm 0.005\\).\nFrom Taylor's theorem:\n\\[e^{x}=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}{e^{2}\\over n!}\\,(x-2)^{n}+{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}(x-2)^{N+1},\\]\nsince \\(f^{(n)}(x)=e^{x}\\) for all \\(n\\). We are interested in \\(x\\) near \\(2\\), and we need to keep \\(|(x-2)^{N+1}|\\) in check, so we may as well specify that \\(|x-2|\\leq 1\\), so \\(x\\in[1,3]\\). Also\n\\[\\left|{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}\\right|\\leq{e^{3}\\over(N+1)!},\\]\nso we need to find an \\(N\\) that makes \\(e^{3}/(N+1)!\\leq 0.005\\).

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n4. In finding the domain of \\(F\\), we notice that we have two potentially hazardous issues: not only do we have a denominator, we have a fourth (even-indexed) root. Our strategy is to determine the restrictions imposed by each part and select the real numbers which satisfy both conditions. To satisfy the fourth root, we require \\(2x+1\\geq 0\\). From this we get \\(2x\\geq-1\\) or \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Next, we round up the values of \\(x\\) which could cause trouble in the denominator by setting the denominator equal to \\(0\\). We get \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), or \\(x=\\pm 1\\). Hence, in order for a real number \\(x\\) to be in the domain of \\(F\\), \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but \\(x\\neq\\pm 1\\). In interval notation, this set is \\(\\left[-\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n5. Don't be put off by the '\\(t\\)' here. It is an independent variable representing a real number, just like \\(x\\) does, and is subject to the same restrictions. As in the previous problem, we have double danger here: we have a square root and a denominator. To satisfy the square root, we need a non-negative radicand so we set \\(t+3\\geq 0\\) to get \\(t\\geq-3\\). Setting the denominator equal to zero gives \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=0\\), or \\(\\sqrt{t+3}=6\\). Squaring both sides gives \\(t+3=36\\), or \\(t=33\\). Since we squared both sides in the course of solving this equation, we need to check our answer.5 Sure enough, when \\(t=33\\), \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=6-\\sqrt{36}=0\\), so \\(t=33\\) will cause problems in the denominator. At last we can find the domain of \\(r\\): we need \\(t\\geq-3\\), but \\(t\\neq 33\\). Our final answer is \\([-3,33)\\cup(33,\\infty)\\). Footnote 5: Do you remember why? Consider squaring both sides to ‘solve’ \\(\\sqrt{t+1}=-2\\).\n6. It's tempting to simplify \\(I(x)=\\frac{3x^{2}}{x}=3x\\), and, since there are no longer any denominators, claim that there are no longer any restrictions. However, in simplifying \\(I(x)\\), we are assuming \\(x\\neq 0\\), since \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) is undefined.6 Proceeding as before, we find the domain of \\(I\\) to be all real numbers except \\(0\\): \\((-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty)\\).\n\n\n",

The normal is \\({\\bf r_{v}}\\times{\\bf r_{u}}=\\langle v,0,0\\rangle\\). We compute the curl:\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\langle x-x^{2},-e^{xy}\\sin z-y,2xz-xe^{xy}\\cos z\\rangle.\\]\nSince \\(x=0\\) everywhere on the surface,\n\\[(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf N}=\\langle 0,-\\sin z-y,0\\rangle\\cdot\\langle v,0,0 \\rangle=0,\\]\nso the surface integral is\n\\[\\int\\limits_{E}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int 0\\,dS=0,\\]\nas before. In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt} +R{dz\\over dt}\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+R\\left({\\partial z \\over\\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt.\\]\nusing the chain rule for \\(dz/dt\\). Now we continue to manipulate this:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+&R\\left({\\partial z\\over \\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt\\cr &=\\int_{a}^{b}\\left[\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right){dx\\over dt}+ \\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right){dy\\over dt}\\right]\\,dt\\cr&=\\int_{ \\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{\\partial z \\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy,}\\]\nwhich now looks just like the line integral of Green's Theorem, except that the functions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) of Green's Theorem have been replaced by the more complicated \\(P+R(\\partial z/\\partial x)\\) and \\(Q+R(\\partial z/\\partial y)\\). We can apply Green's Theorem to get\n\\[\\int_{\\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{ \\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}{\\partial \\over\\partial x}\\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)-{\\partial\\over \\partial y}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dA.\\]\n\n\n",

What is y(t) when $t=pi/2$.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 17.3 First Order Linear Equations\nAs you might guess, a first order linear differential equation has the form \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Not only is this closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Let \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\\[v(t)h(t)+Ae^{P(t)}=v(t)e^{P(t)}+Ae^{P(t)}.\\]\n##### Example 17.3.1\nFind the solution of the initial value problem \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), \\(y(1)=1/2\\). First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given\ncondition at \\(t=1\\), we may assume \\(t>0\\). We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution \\(g\\):\n\\[g=Ae^{-\\int(3/t)\\,dt}=Ae^{-3\\ln t}=At^{-3}.\\]\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\nFinally we substitute to find \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}+A(1)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{6}+A\\] \\[A=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThe solution is then\n\\[y=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}t^{-3}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nHere is an alternate method for finding a particular solution to the differential equation, using an **integrating factor**. In the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), we note that if we multiply through by a function \\(I(t)\\) to get \\(I(t)\\dot{y}+I(t)p(t)y=I(t)f(t)\\), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product rule:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(I(t)y)=I(t)\\dot{y}+I^{\\prime}(t)y.\\]\nNow if we could choose \\(I(t)\\) so that \\(I^{\\prime}(t)=I(t)p(t)\\), this would be exactly the left hand side of the differential equation. But this is just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution is \\(I(t)=e^{Q(t)}\\), where \\(Q(t)=\\int p\\,dt\\); note that \\(Q(t)=-P(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) appears in the variation of parameters method and \\(P^{\\prime}(t)=-p\\). Now the modified differential equation is\n\\[e^{-P(t)}\\dot{y}+e^{-P(t)}p(t)y =e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-P(t)}y) =e^{-P(t)}f(t).\\]\nIntegrating both sides gives\n\\[e^{-P(t)}y =\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt\\] \\[y =e^{P(t)}\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\n\n\n",

The two part path which starts at \\((0,0)\\), travels along a line to \\((3,4)\\), then travels along a line to \\((5,0)\\).\n3. The Unit Circle, oriented clockwise, with \\(t=0\\) corresponding to \\((0,-1)\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. We can parametrize \\(y=x^{2}\\) from \\(x=-1\\) to \\(x=2\\) using the formula given on Page 1053 as \\(\\left\\{x=t,\\,y=t^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-1\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\) This parametrization, however, starts at \\((-1,1)\\) and ends at \\((2,4)\\). Hence, we need to reverse the orientation. To do so, we replace every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\(-t\\) to get \\(\\left\\{x=-t,\\,y=(-t)^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-1\\leq-t\\leq 2\\right.\\) After simplifying, we get \\(\\left\\{x=-t,\\,y=t^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-2\\leq t\\leq 1\\right.\\) We would like \\(t\\) to begin at \\(t=0\\) instead of \\(t=-2\\). The problem here is that the parametrization we have starts \\(2\\) units 'too soon', so we need to introduce a 'time delay' of \\(2\\). Replacing every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\((t-2)\\) gives \\(\\left\\{x=-(t-2),\\,y=(t-2)^{2}\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,-2\\leq t-2\\leq 1\\right.\\) Simplifying yields \\(\\left\\{x=2-t,\\,y=t^{2}-4t+4\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,0\\leq t\\leq 3\\right.\\)\n2. When parameterizing line segments, we think: 'starting point \\(+\\) (displacement)\\(t\\)'. For the first part of the path, we get \\(\\left\\{x=3t,\\,y=4t\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\right.\\), and for the second part we get \\(\\left\\{x=3+2t,\\,y=4-4t\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\right.\\). Since the first parametrization leaves off at \\(t=1\\), we shift the parameter in the second part so it starts at \\(t=1\\). Our current description of the second part starts at \\(t=0\\), so we introduce a 'time delay' of \\(1\\) unit to the second set of parametric equations. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\((t-1)\\) in the second set of parametric equations gives \\(\\left\\{x=3+2(t-1),\\,y=4-4(t-1)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t-1\\leq 1\\right.\\). Simplifying yields \\(\\left\\{x=1+2t,\\,y=8-4t\\,\\text{ for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\). Hence, we may parametrize the path as \\(\\left\\{x=f(t),\\,y=g(t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t\\leq 2\\right.\\) where \\[f(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}3t,&\\text{for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\\\ 1+2t,&\\text{for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\end{array}\\right.\\text{ and }\\;g(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}4t,&\\text{for }0\\leq t\\leq 1\\\\ 8-4t,&\\text{for }1\\leq t\\leq 2\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n3. We know that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=\\sin(t)\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{ gives a {\\em counter-clockwise} parametrization of the Unit Circle with }t=0\\text{ corresponding to }(1,0)\\), so the first order of business is to reverse the orientation. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\(-t\\) gives \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(-t),\\,y=\\sin(-t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq-t<2\\pi\\right.\\), which simplifies9 to \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-2\\pi<t\\leq 0\\right.\\). This parametrization gives a clockwise orientation, but \\(t=0\\) still corresponds to the point \\((1,0)\\); the point \\((0,-1)\\) is reached when \\(t=-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Our strategy is to first get the parametrization to 'start' at the point \\((0,-1)\\) and then shift the parameter accordingly so the 'start' coincides with \\(t=0\\). We know that any interval of length \\(2\\pi\\) will parametrize the entire circle, so we keep the equations \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{, but start the parameter }t\\text{ at }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\text{, and find the upper bound by adding }2\\pi\\text{ so }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). The reader can verify that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\text{ traces out the Unit Circle clockwise starting at the point }(0,-1)\\). We now shift the parameter by introducing a 'time delay' of \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) units by replacing every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\(\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We get \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right),\\,y=-\\sin\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\right)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right.\\). This simplifies10 to \\(\\left\\{x=-\\sin(t),\\,y=-\\cos(t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{, as required.}\\right.\\)\nWe put our answer to Example 11.10.4 number 3 to good use to derive the equation of a cycloid.

Each row holds the computation for a single step: the starting point \\((t_{i},y_{i})\\); the stepsize \\(\\Delta t\\); the computed slope \\(\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\); the change in \\(y\\), \\(\\Delta y=\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\Delta t\\); and the new point, \\((t_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(t_{i}+\\Delta t,y_{i}+\\Delta y)\\). The starting point in each row is the newly computed point from the end of the previous row.\nIt is easy to write a short function in Sage to do Euler's method; see this Sage worksheet.\n#### 17 Differential Equations\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\((t,y)\\) & \\(\\Delta t\\) & \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) & \\(\\Delta y=\\phi(t,y)\\Delta t\\) & \\((t+\\Delta t,y+\\Delta y)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0,0)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0\\) & \\(0\\) & \\((0.2,0)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.2,0)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.04\\) & \\((0.4,0.04)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.4,0.04)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.3984\\) & \\(0.07968\\) & \\((0.6,0.11968)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.6,0.11968)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.58\\ldots\\) & \\(0.117\\ldots\\) & \\((0.8,0.236\\ldots)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\((0.8,0.236\\ldots)\\) & \\(0.2\\) & \\(0.743\\ldots\\) & \\(0.148\\ldots\\) & \\((1.0,0.385\\ldots)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n**Figure 17.4.2** Computing with Euler's Method.\nEuler's method is related to another technique that can help in understanding a differential equation in a qualitative way. Euler's method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing \\(\\phi(t,y)\\). If we compute \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a **slope field**. A slope field for \\(\\phi=t-y^{2}\\) is shown in figure 17.4.3; compare this to figure 17.4.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method visually.\n**Figure 17.4.3** A slope field for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\).\nEven when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from exercise 13 in section 17.1, \\(\\dot{y}=ky(M-y)\\): \\(y\\) is a population at time \\(t\\), \\(M\\) is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and \\(k\\) measures the reproduction rate of the population. Figure 17.4.4 shows a slope field for this equation\nthat is quite informative. It is apparent that if the initial population is smaller than \\(M\\) it rises to \\(M\\) over the long term, while if the initial population is greater than \\(M\\) it decreases to \\(M\\). It is quite easy to generate slope fields with Sage; follow the AP link in the figure caption.\n##### Exercises 17.4\nIn problems 1-4, compute the Euler approximations for the initial value problem for \\(0\\leq t\\leq 1\\) and \\(\\Delta t=0.2\\). Using Sage, generate the slope field first and attempt to sketch the solution curve. Then use Sage to compute better approximations with smaller values of \\(\\Delta t\\).\n**1.**\\(\\dot{y}=t/y\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**2.**\\(\\dot{y}=t+y^{3}\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**3.**\\(\\dot{y}=\\cos(t+y)\\), \\(y(0)=1\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**4.**\\(\\dot{y}=t\\ln y\\), \\(y(0)=2\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\n\n",

A vector tangent to this path is given by the derivative \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(r)=\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\), and a small tangent vector, with length approximately equal to the side of the region, is \\(\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr\\). Likewise, if we fix \\(r=r_{0}=0.5\\), we get the vector function \\({\\bf w}(\\theta)=\\langle r_{0}\\cos\\theta,r_{0}\\sin\\theta,0\\rangle\\) with derivative \\({\\bf w}^{\\prime}(\\theta)=\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta,r_{0}\\cos\\theta,0\\rangle\\) and a small tangent vector \\(\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\) when \\(\\theta=\\theta_{0}\\) (at the corner we're focusing on). These vectors are shown in figure 15.7.4, with the actual region outlined by a dotted boundary. Of course, since both \\(\\Delta r\\) and \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly good approximation to the true area.\nThe area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\langle-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0},r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,d\\theta \\times\\langle\\cos\\theta_{0},\\sin\\theta_{0},0\\rangle\\,dr&=\\left|\\matrix{\\bf i &\\bf j&\\bf k\\cr-r_{0}\\sin\\theta_{0}&r_{0}\\cos\\theta_{0}&0\\cr\\cos\\theta_{0}& \\sin\\theta_{0}&0\\cr}\\right|\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{0}-r_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr\\cr&=\\langle 0,0,-r_{0}\\rangle\\,d\\theta\\,dr.}\\]\nThe length of this vector is \\(r_{0}\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). So in general, for any values of \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), the area in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane corresponding to a small rectangle anchored at \\((\\theta,r)\\) in the \\(r\\)-\\(\\theta\\) plane is approximately \\(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\). In other words, \"\\(r\\)\" replaces the \"?\" in equation 15.7.2.\nIn general, a substitution will start with equations \\(x=f(u,v)\\) and \\(y=g(u,v)\\). Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\). The quantity \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\) is usually denoted\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|=|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\]\nand called the **Jacobian**. Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant\n\\[\\left|\\matrix{f_{u}&g_{u}\\cr f_{v}&g_{v}\\cr}\\right|,\\]\nwhich may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the interior of the unit circle. This is still not an easy integral, but it is easily transformed to polar coordinates, and then easily integrated. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 15.7.5**\\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\)\nThere is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals, though it is a bit more difficult to derive. Suppose we use three substitution functions, \\(x=f(u,v,w)\\), \\(y=g(u,v,w)\\), and \\(z=h(u,v,w)\\). The Jacobian determinant is now\n\\[\\frac{\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\partial(u,v,w)}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}f_{u}&g_{u}&h _{u}\\\\ f_{v}&g_{v}&h_{v}\\\\ f_{w}&g_{w}&h_{w}\\end{array}\\right|.\\]\nThen the integral is transformed in a similar fashion:\n\n\n",

Is there a global maximum on interval $[0, 1]$?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow let's turn our attention to a few of the points on the graph. Clearly the point \\((-2,4.5)\\) does not have the largest \\(y\\) value of all of the points on the graph of \\(f\\,-\\) indeed that honor goes to \\((6,5.5)\\,-\\) but \\((-2,4.5)\\) should get some sort of consolation prize for being 'the top of the hill' between \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=3\\). We say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local maximum8** at the point \\((-2,4.5)\\), because the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(4.5\\) is the largest \\(y\\)-value (hence, function value) on the curve 'near'9\\(x=-2\\). Similarly, we say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local minimum**10 at the point \\((3,-8)\\), since the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(-8\\) is the smallest function value near \\(x=3\\). Although it is tempting to say that local extrema11 occur when the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it is not a precise enough way to define the concepts for the needs of Calculus. At the risk of being pedantic, we will present the traditional definitions and thoroughly vet the pathologies they induce in the Exercises. We have one last observation to make before we proceed to the algebraic definitions and look at a fairly tame, yet helpful, example.\nFootnote 10: Also called a ‘relative minimum’.\nIf we look at the entire graph, we see that the largest \\(y\\) value (the largest function value) is \\(5.5\\) at \\(x=6\\). In this case, we say the **maximum12** of \\(f\\) is \\(5.5\\); similarly, the **minimum13** of \\(f\\) is \\(-8\\).\nFootnote 12: ‘Maxima’ is the plural of ‘maximum’ and ‘mimima’ is the plural of ‘minimum’. ‘Extrema’ is the plural of ‘extremum’ which combines maximum and minimum.\nWe formalize these concepts in the following definitions.\n**Definition 1.11**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a function with \\(f(a)=b\\).\n* We say \\(f\\) has a **local maximum** at the point \\((a,b)\\) if and only if there is an open interval \\(I\\) containing \\(a\\) for which \\(f(a)\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\). The value \\(f(a)=b\\) is called 'a local maximum value of \\(f\\)' in this case.\n* We say \\(f\\) has a **local minimum** at the point \\((a,b)\\) if and only if there is an open interval \\(I\\) containing \\(a\\) for which \\(f(a)\\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\). The value \\(f(a)=b\\) is called 'a local minimum value of \\(f\\)' in this case.\n* The value \\(b\\) is called the **maximum** of \\(f\\) if \\(b\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\).\n* The value \\(b\\) is called the **minimum** of \\(f\\) if \\(b\\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\).\nIt's important to note that not every function will have all of these features. Indeed, it is possible to have a function with no local or absolute extrema at all! (Any ideas of what such a function's graph would have to look like?) We shall see examples of functions in the Exercises which have one or two, but not all, of these features, some that have instances of each type of extremum and some functions that seem to defy common sense. In all cases, though, we shall adhere to the algebraic definitions above as we explore the wonderful diversity of graphs that functions provide us.\nHere is the 'tame' example which was promised earlier. It summarizes all of the concepts presented in this section as well as some from previous sections so you should spend some time thinking deeply about it before proceeding to the Exercises.\n\n\n",

If a sequence is bounded above and bounded below it is **bounded**. If a sequence \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by \\(a_{0}\\)), and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is bounded above (by \\(a_{0}\\)). Finally, with all this new terminology we can state an important theorem.\n**Theorem 11.1.12** If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n**Example 11.1.13** All of the terms \\((2^{i}-1)/2^{i}\\) are less than 2, and the sequence is increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\nAgain we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know. So we look at \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\):\n\\[{a_{n+1}\\over a_{n}}={(n+1)!\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}{n^{n}\\over n!}={(n+1)!\\over n!} {n^{n}\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}={n+1\\over n+1}\\left({n\\over n+1}\\right)^{n}=\\left({n \\over n+1}\\right)^{n}<1.\\]\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nUsing n=8 approximate the value of $\\int_{0}^4 cos(1 + \\sqrt{x}) dx$ using the Simpson's rule.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\nTo find the parabola, we solve these three equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[f(x_{i}) =a(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}-\\Delta x)+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+1}) =a(x_{i+1})^{2}+b(x_{i+1})+c\\] \\[f(x_{i+2}) =a(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)^{2}+b(x_{i+1}+\\Delta x)+c\\]\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFigure 8.6.3: A parabola (dashed) approximating a curve (solid). (AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\n\n",

The sign of the second derivative \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) tells us whether \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is increasing or decreasing; we have seen that if \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is zero and increasing at a point then there is a local minimum at the point, and if \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is zero and decreasing at a point then there is a local maximum at the point. Thus, we extracted information about \\(f\\) from information about \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\).\nWe can get information from the sign of \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) even when \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is not zero. Suppose that \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(a)>0\\). This means that near \\(x=a\\), \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is increasing. If \\(f^{\\prime}(a)>0\\), this means that \\(f\\) slopes up and is getting steeper; if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)<0\\), this means that \\(f\\) slopes down and is getting _less_ steep. The two situations are shown in figure 5.4.1. A curve that is shaped like this is called **concave up**.\nNow suppose that \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(a)<0\\). This means that near \\(x=a\\), \\(f^{\\prime}\\) is decreasing. If \\(f^{\\prime}(a)>0\\), this means that \\(f\\) slopes up and is getting less steep; if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)<0\\), this means that \\(f\\) slopes down and is getting steeper. The two situations are shown in figure 5.4.2. A curve that is shaped like this is called **concave down**.\nIf we are trying to understand the shape of the graph of a function, knowing where it is concave up and concave down helps us to get a more accurate picture. Of particular interest are points at which the concavity changes from up to down or down to up; such\nFigure 5.4.2: \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(a)<0\\): \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) positive and decreasing, \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) negative and decreasing.\npoints are called **inflection points**. If the concavity changes from up to down at \\(x=a\\), \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) changes from positive to the left of \\(a\\) to negative to the right of \\(a\\), and usually \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(a)=0\\). We can identify such points by first finding where \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) is zero and then checking to see whether \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)\\) does in fact go from positive to negative or negative to positive at these points. Note that it is possible that \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(a)=0\\) but the concavity is the same on both sides; \\(f(x)=x^{4}\\) at \\(x=0\\) is an example.\n**Example 5.4.1**: Describe the concavity of \\(f(x)=x^{3}-x\\). First, we compute \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=3x^{2}-1\\) and \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=6x\\). Since \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(0)=0\\), there is potentially an inflection point at zero. Since \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)>0\\) when \\(x>0\\) and \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)<0\\) when \\(x<0\\) the concavity does change from down to up at zero, and the curve is concave down for all \\(x<0\\) and concave up for all \\(x>0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nNote that we need to compute and analyze the second derivative to understand concavity, so we may as well try to use the second derivative test for maxima and minima. If for some reason this fails we can then try one of the other tests.\n#### Exercises 5.4.\nDescribe the concavity of the functions in 1-18.\n1. \\(y=x^{2}-x\\Rightarrow\\)\n2. \\(y=x^{3}-9x^{2}+24x\\Rightarrow\\)\n3. \\(y=3x^{4}-4x^{3}\\Rightarrow\\)\n4. \\(y=3x^{2}-(1/x^{2})\\Rightarrow\\)\n5. \\(y=4x+\\sqrt{1-x}\\Rightarrow\\)\n6. \\(y=x^{5}-x\\Rightarrow\\)\n7. \\(y=x+1/x\\Rightarrow\\)\n8. \\(y=x+5^{1/4}\\Rightarrow\\)\n\n\n",

The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\). This point is on the upper hemisphere, so we use \\(f(x,y)=\\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\). Then \\(f_{x}(x,y)=-x(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\) and \\(f_{y}(x,y)=-y(4-x^{2}-y^{2})^{-1/2}\\), so \\(f_{x}(1,1)=f_{y}(1,1)=-1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and the equation of the plane is\n\\[z=-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(x-1)-{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}(y-1)+\\sqrt{2}.\\]\nThe hemisphere and this tangent plane are pictured in figure 14.3.3. \\(\\Box\\)\nSo it appears that to find a tangent plane, we need only find two quite simple ordinary derivatives, namely \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\). This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n**362 Chapter 14 Partial Differentiation**\nWhen does a surface have a tangent plane at a particular point? What we really want from a tangent plane, as from a tangent line, is that the plane be a \"good\" approximation of the surface near the point. Here is how we can make this precise:\n**DEFINITION 14.3.4** Let \\(\\Delta x=x-x_{0}\\), \\(\\Delta y=y-y_{0}\\), and \\(\\Delta z=z-z_{0}\\) where \\(z_{0}=f(x_{0},y_{0})\\). The function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) is differentiable at \\((x_{0},y_{0})\\) if\n\\[\\Delta z=f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})\\Delta x+f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})\\Delta y+\\epsilon_{1} \\Delta x+\\epsilon_{2}\\Delta y,\\]\nand both \\(\\epsilon_{1}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{2}\\) approach 0 as \\((x,y)\\) approaches \\((x_{0},y_{0})\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThis definition takes a bit of absorbing. Let's rewrite the central equation a bit:\n\\[z=f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})(x-x_{0})+f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})(y-y_{0})+f(x_{0},y_{0})+ \\epsilon_{1}\\Delta x+\\epsilon_{2}\\Delta y.\\]\n\n\n",

When \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) is \\(0\\), so the limit of \\(f(x,y)\\) approaching the origin along either the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) axis is \\(0\\). Moreover, along the line \\(y=mx\\), \\(f(x,y)=m^{2}x^{3}/(x^{2}+m^{4}x^{4})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\) this expression approaches \\(0\\) as well. So along every line through the origin \\(f(x,y)\\) approaches \\(0\\). Now suppose we approach the origin along \\(x=y^{2}\\). Then\n\\[f(x,y)={y^{2}y^{2}\\over y^{4}+y^{4}}={y^{4}\\over 2y^{4}}={1\\over 2},\\]\nso the limit is \\(1/2\\). Looking at figure 14.2.1, it is apparent that there is a ridge above \\(x=y^{2}\\). Approaching the origin along a straight line, we go over the ridge and then drop down toward \\(0\\), but approaching along the ridge the height is a constant \\(1/2\\). Thus, there is no limit at \\((0,0)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFortunately, we can define the concept of limit without needing to specify how a particular point is approached--indeed, in definition 2.3.2, we didn't need the concept of \"approach.\" Roughly, that definition says that when \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\) then \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\); there is no mention of \"how\" we get close to \\(a\\). We can adapt that definition to two variables quite easily:\n**DEFINITION 14.2.2** Limit Suppose \\(f(x,y)\\) is a function. We say that\n\\[\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L\\]\nif for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<\\sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}}<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.1**\\(f(x,y)=\\frac{xy^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{4}}\\) (AP)\nThis says that we can make \\(|f(x,y)-L|<\\epsilon\\), no matter how small \\(\\epsilon\\) is, by making the distance from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((a,b)\\) \"small enough\".\n**Example 14.2.3** We show that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}=0\\). Suppose \\(\\epsilon>0\\). Then\n\\[\\left|\\frac{3x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|=\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|.\\]\nNote that \\(x^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\leq 1\\) and \\(|y|=\\sqrt{y^{2}}\\leq\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}<\\delta\\). So\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}3|y|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot\\delta.\\]\nWe want to force this to be less than \\(\\epsilon\\) by picking \\(\\delta\\) \"small enough.\" If we choose \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/3\\) then\n\\[\\left|{3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right|<1\\cdot 3\\cdot{\\epsilon\\over 3}=\\epsilon.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\); roughly this says that there is no \"hole\" or \"jump\" at \\(x=a\\). We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n**THEOREM 14.2.6** Polynomials are continuous everywhere. Rational functions are continuous everywhere they are defined.\n_Exercises 14.2._\nDetermine whether each limit exists.

The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\narea under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areas is less than the area under the entire curve, that is, all the way to infinity. There is a bit of trouble at the left end, where there is an asymptote, but we can work around that easily. Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe already know that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\nThe rectangles this time are above the curve, that is, each rectangle completely contains the corresponding area under the curve. This means that\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}>\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1 \\over x}\\,dx=\\ln x\\Big{|}_{1}^{n+1}=\\ln(n+1).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets bigger, \\(\\ln(n+1)\\) goes to infinity, so the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) must also go to infinity, so the harmonic series diverges. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 11.3.2** Graph of \\(y=1/x\\) with rectangles.\nThe important fact that clinches this example is that\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty,\\]\nwhich we can rewrite as\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty.\\]\nSo these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the **integral test**, which we state as a theorem.\n**Theorem 11.3.3** Suppose that \\(f(x)>0\\) and is decreasing on the infinite interval \\([k,\\infty)\\) (for some \\(k\\geq 1\\)) and that \\(a_{n}=f(n)\\). Then the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges if and only if the improper integral \\(\\int_{1}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,dx\\) converges.\nThe two examples we have seen are called \\(p\\)-series; a \\(p\\)-series is any series of the form \\(\\sum 1/n^{p}\\). If \\(p\\leq 0\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}1/n^{p}\\neq 0\\), so the series diverges. For positive values of \\(p\\) we can determine precisely which series converge.\n**Theorem 11.3.4** A \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>0\\) converges if and only if \\(p>1\\).\n_Proof._ We use the integral test; we have already done \\(p=1\\), so assume that \\(p\\neq 1\\).\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nWhat is \\lim_{x \\to 0} (csc(x) - cot(x))?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) as read from the graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.\nThe properties of the tangent and cotangent functions are summarized below. As with Theorem 10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.\n**Theorem 10.25**. **Properties of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions**\n* The function \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\)\n* has domain \\(\\left\\{x:x\\neq\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k,\\ k\\ \\mbox{is an integer}\\right\\}=\\bigcup_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2},\\frac{(2k+3)\\pi}{2}\\right)\\)\n\n\n",

(You may want to review the concepts in section 9.6.)\nThe key to the computation, just as before, is the approximation of mass. In the two-dimensional case, we treat density \\(\\sigma\\) as mass per square area, so when density is constant, mass is (density)(area). If we have a two-dimensional region with varying density given by \\(\\sigma(x,y)\\), and we divide the region into small subregions with area \\(\\Delta A\\), then the mass of one subregion is approximately \\(\\sigma(x_{i},y_{j})\\Delta A\\), the total mass is approximately the sum of many of these, and as usual the sum turns into an integral in the limit:\n\\[M=\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\\int_{y_{0}}^{y_{1}}\\sigma(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx,\\]\nand similarly for computations in cylindrical coordinates. Then as before\n\\[M_{x} =\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\\int_{y_{0}}^{y_{1}}y\\sigma(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx\\] \\[M_{y} =\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}\\int_{y_{0}}^{y_{1}}x\\sigma(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\n**Example 15.3.1** Find the center of mass of a thin, uniform plate whose shape is the region between \\(y=\\cos x\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis between \\(x=-\\pi/2\\) and \\(x=\\pi/2\\). Since the density is constant, we may take \\(\\sigma(x,y)=1\\).\nIt is clear that \\(\\bar{x}=0\\), but for practice let's compute it anyway. First we compute the mass:\n\\[M=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}1\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\cos x \\,dx=\\left.\\sin x\\right|_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}=2.\\]\nNext,\n\\[M_{x}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}y\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^{2}x\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]\nFinally,\n\\[M_{y}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}x\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}x\\cos x \\,dx=0.\\]\nSo \\(\\bar{x}=0\\) as expected, and \\(\\bar{y}=\\pi/4/2=\\pi/8\\). This is the same problem as in example 9.6.4; it may be helpful to compare the two solutions. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 15.3.2**: Find the center of mass of a two-dimensional plate that occupies the quarter circle \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\) in the first quadrant and has density \\(k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\). It seems clear that because of the symmetry of both the region and the density function (both are important!), \\(\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}\\). We'll do both to check our work.\nJumping right in:\n\\[M=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\,dy\\,dx=k\\int_{0}^{1}x^{ 2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\\frac{(1-x^{2})^{3/2}}{3}\\,dx.\\]\nThis integral is something we can do, but it's a bit unpleasant. Since everything in sight is related to a circle, let's back up and try polar coordinates. Then \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\\) and\n\\[M=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{1}k(r^{2})\\,r\\,dr\\,d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\left. \\frac{r^{4}}{4}\\right|_{0}^{1}d\\theta=k\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\left.\\frac{1}{4}\\,d \\theta=k\\frac{\\pi}{8}.\\]\nMuch better.

We compute the curl:\n\\[\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}=\\langle x-x^{2},-e^{xy}\\sin z-y,2xz-xe^{xy}\\cos z\\rangle.\\]\nSince \\(x=0\\) everywhere on the surface,\n\\[(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{\\bf N}=\\langle 0,-\\sin z-y,0\\rangle\\cdot\\langle v,0,0 \\rangle=0,\\]\nso the surface integral is\n\\[\\int\\limits_{E}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int 0\\,dS=0,\\]\nas before. In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt} +R{dz\\over dt}\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+R\\left({\\partial z \\over\\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt.\\]\nusing the chain rule for \\(dz/dt\\). Now we continue to manipulate this:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}P{dx\\over dt}+Q{dy\\over dt}+&R\\left({\\partial z\\over \\partial x}{dx\\over dt}+{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}{dy\\over dt}\\right)\\,dt\\cr &=\\int_{a}^{b}\\left[\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right){dx\\over dt}+ \\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right){dy\\over dt}\\right]\\,dt\\cr&=\\int_{ \\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{\\partial z \\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy,}\\]\nwhich now looks just like the line integral of Green's Theorem, except that the functions \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) of Green's Theorem have been replaced by the more complicated \\(P+R(\\partial z/\\partial x)\\) and \\(Q+R(\\partial z/\\partial y)\\). We can apply Green's Theorem to get\n\\[\\int_{\\partial E}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dx+\\left(Q+R{ \\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)\\,dy=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}{\\partial \\over\\partial x}\\left(Q+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial y}\\right)-{\\partial\\over \\partial y}\\left(P+R{\\partial z\\over\\partial x}\\right)\\,dA.\\]\nNow we can use the chain rule again to evaluate the derivatives inside this integral, and it becomes\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}&Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}+R_{z}g_{x}g_{ y}+Rg_{yx}-\\left(P_{y}+P_{z}g_{y}+R_{y}g_{x}+R_{z}g_{y}g_{x}+Rg_{xy}\\right)\\,dA\\cr&= \\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}-P_{y}-P_{z}g_{y}-R_{y}g_ {x}\\,dA,}\\]\nwhich is the same as the expression we obtained for the surface integral.\n### 16 Vector Calculus\n#### Exercises 16.8\n\n\n",

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n4. In finding the domain of \\(F\\), we notice that we have two potentially hazardous issues: not only do we have a denominator, we have a fourth (even-indexed) root. Our strategy is to determine the restrictions imposed by each part and select the real numbers which satisfy both conditions. To satisfy the fourth root, we require \\(2x+1\\geq 0\\). From this we get \\(2x\\geq-1\\) or \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Next, we round up the values of \\(x\\) which could cause trouble in the denominator by setting the denominator equal to \\(0\\). We get \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), or \\(x=\\pm 1\\). Hence, in order for a real number \\(x\\) to be in the domain of \\(F\\), \\(x\\geq-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but \\(x\\neq\\pm 1\\). In interval notation, this set is \\(\\left[-\\frac{1}{2},1\\right)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n5. Don't be put off by the '\\(t\\)' here. It is an independent variable representing a real number, just like \\(x\\) does, and is subject to the same restrictions. As in the previous problem, we have double danger here: we have a square root and a denominator. To satisfy the square root, we need a non-negative radicand so we set \\(t+3\\geq 0\\) to get \\(t\\geq-3\\). Setting the denominator equal to zero gives \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=0\\), or \\(\\sqrt{t+3}=6\\). Squaring both sides gives \\(t+3=36\\), or \\(t=33\\). Since we squared both sides in the course of solving this equation, we need to check our answer.5 Sure enough, when \\(t=33\\), \\(6-\\sqrt{t+3}=6-\\sqrt{36}=0\\), so \\(t=33\\) will cause problems in the denominator. At last we can find the domain of \\(r\\): we need \\(t\\geq-3\\), but \\(t\\neq 33\\). Our final answer is \\([-3,33)\\cup(33,\\infty)\\). Footnote 5: Do you remember why? Consider squaring both sides to ‘solve’ \\(\\sqrt{t+1}=-2\\).\n6. It's tempting to simplify \\(I(x)=\\frac{3x^{2}}{x}=3x\\), and, since there are no longer any denominators, claim that there are no longer any restrictions. However, in simplifying \\(I(x)\\), we are assuming \\(x\\neq 0\\), since \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) is undefined.6 Proceeding as before, we find the domain of \\(I\\) to be all real numbers except \\(0\\): \\((-\\infty,0)\\cup(0,\\infty)\\).\n\n\n",

We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary.

Find the mean velocity of motion between times t=1 and t=10.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 7.1 Two examples\nUp to now we have been concerned with extracting information about how a function changes from the function itself. Given knowledge about an object's position, for example, we want to know the object's speed. Given information about the height of a curve we want to know its slope. We now consider problems that are, whether obviously or not, the reverse of such problems.\n##### Example 7.1.1\nAn object moves in a straight line so that its speed at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(v(t)=3t\\) in, say, cm/sec. If the object is at position 10 on the straight line when \\(t=0\\), where is the object at any time \\(t\\)?\nThere are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult but also more general.\nWe start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at \\(t=0\\) the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, \\(t=1\\)? We know that the speed of the object at time \\(t=0\\) is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when \\(t=1\\). In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at \\(t=1\\), but certainly we can do better. Let's look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object\nat each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from \\(t=0.1\\) to \\(t=0.2\\), we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at \\(t=0.1\\). In this case the object would travel \\((0.3)(0.1)=0.03\\) centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between \\(t=0.2\\) and \\(t=0.3\\) the object would travel \\((0.6)(0.1)=0.06\\) centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object travels\n\\[(0.0)(0.1)+(0.3)(0.1)+(0.6)(0.1)+\\cdots+(2.7)(0.1)=1.35\\]\ncentimeters, ending up at position 11.35. This is a better approximation than 10, certainly, but is still just an approximation. (We know in fact that the object ends up at position 11.5, because we've already done the problem using the first approach.) Presumably, we will get a better approximation if we divide the time into one hundred intervals of a hundredth of a second each, and repeat the process:\n\\[(0.0)(0.01)+(0.03)(0.01)+(0.06)(0.01)+\\cdots+(2.97)(0.01)=1.485.\\]\nWe thus approximate the position as 11.485. Since we know the exact answer, we can see that this is much closer, but if we did not already know the answer, we wouldn't really know how close.\n\n\n",

Since this is an inverse function, we can discover the derivative by using implicit differentiation. Suppose \\(y=\\arcsin(x)\\).

In many cases it is possible at least to determine whether or not the series converges, and so we will spend most of our time on this problem.\nIf all of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the terms \\(a_{n}\\) approach zero, but this does not mean that \\(a_{n}\\geq a_{n+1}\\) for every \\(n\\). Many useful and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to understand. Let's look at an example.\n##### Example 11.3.1\nShow that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges.\nThe terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) are positive and decreasing, and since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1/x^{2}=0\\), the terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number \\(N\\) so that \\(s_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\). The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is inherent in figure 11.\nThe figure shows the graph of \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\narea under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areas is less than the area under the entire curve, that is, all the way to infinity. There is a bit of trouble at the left end, where there is an asymptote, but we can work around that easily. Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe already know that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\n\n\n",

Since \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\), it's clear that \\(a^{5}\\cdot a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a=a^{8}=a^{5 +3}\\), and in general that \\(a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}\\). Since \"the logarithm is the exponent,\" it's no surprise that this translates directly into a fact about the logarithm function. Here are three facts\nfrom the example: \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5})=5\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{3})=3\\), \\(\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8\\). So \\(\\log_{a}(a^{5}a^{3})=\\log_{a}(a^{8})=8=5+3=\\log_{a}(a^{5})+\\log_{a}(a^{3})\\). Now let's make this a bit more general.

Then \\(\\log_{a}(AB)=\\log_{a}(a^{x}a^{y})=\\log_{a}(a^{x+y})=x+y=\\log_{a}(A)+\\log_{a}(B)\\).\nNow consider \\((a^{5})^{3}=a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}\\cdot a^{5}=a^{5+5+5}=a^{5\\cdot 3}=a^{15}\\). Again it's clear that more generally \\((a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}\\), and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If \\(A=a^{x}\\) then \\(A^{y}=(a^{x})^{y}=a^{xy}\\), so \\(\\log_{a}(A^{y})=xy=y\\log_{a}(A)\\)--the exponent can be \"pulled out in front.\"\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\n\\lim_{x \\to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWhile theorem 2.3.6 is very helpful, we need a bit more to work easily with limits. Since the theorem applies when some limits are already known, we need to know the behavior of some functions that cannot themselves be constructed from the simple arithmetic operations of the theorem, such as \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Also, there is one other extraordinarily useful way to put functions together: composition. If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are functions, we can form two functions by composition: \\(f(g(x))\\) and \\(g(f(x))\\). For example, if \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}+5\\), then \\(f(g(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}+5}\\) and \\(g(f(x))=(\\sqrt{x})^{2}+5=x+5\\). Here is a companion to theorem 2.3.6 for composition:\n**Theorem 2.3.9**: Suppose that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=f(L)\\). Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a}f(g(x))=f(L).\\]\n\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nNote the special form of the condition on \\(f\\): it is not enough to know that \\(\\lim_{x\\to L}f(x)=M\\), though it is a bit tricky to see why. Many of the most familiar functions do have this property, and this theorem can therefore be applied. For example:\n**Theorem 2.3.10**: Suppose that \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Then\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to a}\\sqrt[n]{x}=\\sqrt[n]{a},\\]\nprovided that \\(a\\) is positive if \\(n\\) is even.\nThis theorem is not too difficult to prove from the definition of limit.\nAnother of the most common algebraic tricks was used in section 2.1. Here's another example:\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.11**  Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1}\\).\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1} =\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}-2}{x+1}\\frac{\\sqrt{x+5}+2}{\\sqrt{x+ 5}+2}\\] \\[=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{x+5-4}{(x+1)(\\sqrt{x+5}+2)}\\] \\[=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{x+1}{(x+1)(\\sqrt{x+5}+2)}\\] \\[=\\lim_{x\\to-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+5}+2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\]\nAt the very last step we have used theorems 2.3.9 and 2.3.10. \\(\\Box\\)\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nUsually \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the left\" and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the right\".\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.13**  Discuss \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\).\nThe function \\(f(x)=x/|x|\\) is undefined at 0; when \\(x>0\\), \\(|x|=x\\) and so \\(f(x)=1\\); when \\(x<0\\), \\(|x|=-x\\) and \\(f(x)=-1\\). Thus \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}\\frac{x}{|x|}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}}-1=-1\\) while\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}1=1\\). The limit of \\(f(x)\\) must be equal to both the left and right limits; since they are different, the limit \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{|x|}\\) does not exist. \\(\\Box\\)\n#### Exercises 2.3.\nCompute the limits.

To avoid this, he wants to move his rectangular pasture _away_ from the river. This means that all four sides of the pasture require fencing. If the total amount of fencing available is still 200 linear feet, what dimensions maximize the area of the pasture now? What is the maximum area? Assuming an average alpaca requires 25 square feet of pasture, how many alpaca can he raise now?\n21. What is the largest rectangular area one can enclose with 14 inches of string?\n22.

Here, \\(h\\) is the height of the object off the ground, in feet, \\(t\\) seconds after the object is dropped. How long before the object hits the ground?\n23.

In one event, the hammer throw, the height \\(h\\) in feet of the hammer above the ground \\(t\\) seconds after Jason lets it go is modeled by \\(h(t)=-16t^{2}+22.08t+6\\). What is the hammer's maximum height? What is the hammer's total time in the air? Round your answers to two decimal places.\n25. Assuming no air resistance or forces other than the Earth's gravity, the height above the ground at time \\(t\\) of a falling object is given by \\(s(t)=-4.9t^{2}+v_{{}_{0}}t+s_{{}_{0}}\\) where \\(s\\) is in meters, \\(t\\) is in seconds, \\(v_{{}_{0}}\\) is the object's initial velocity in meters per second and \\(s_{{}_{0}}\\) is its initial position in meters. 1.

Let's say a slingshot is used to shoot a marble straight up from the ground (\\(s_{{}_{0}}=0\\)) with an initial velocity of 15 meters per second. What is the marble's maximum height above the ground? At what time will it hit the ground? 5. Now shoot the marble from the top of a tower which is 25 meters tall. When does it hit the ground? 6. What would the height function be if instead of shooting the marble up off of the tower, you were to shoot it straight DOWN from the top of the tower?\n26. The two towers of a suspension bridge are 400 feet apart. The parabolic cable11 attached to the tops of the towers is 10 feet above the point on the bridge deck that is midway between the towers. If the towers are 100 feet tall, find the height of the cable directly above a point of the bridge deck that is 50 feet to the right of the left-hand tower.

Using the quadratic formula, this polynomial always has one or two roots, call them \\(r\\) and \\(s\\).

If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nOther physical systems that oscillate can also be described by such differential equations. Some electric circuits, for example, generate oscillating current.\n##### Example 17.5.4\nFind the solution to the intial value problem \\(\\ddot{y}-4\\dot{y}+4y=0\\), \\(y(0)=-3\\), \\(\\dot{y}(0)=1\\). The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}-4x+4=(x-2)^{2}\\), so there\nis one root, \\(r=2\\), and the general solution is \\(Ae^{2t}+Bte^{2t}\\). Substituting \\(t=0\\) we get \\(-3=A+0=A\\). The first derivative is \\(2Ae^{2t}+2Bte^{2t}+Be^{2t}\\); substituting \\(t=0\\) gives \\(1=2A+0+B=2A+B=2(-3)+B=-6+B\\), so \\(B=7\\).

Theorem 10.3 tells us that \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{a}{c}\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{b}{c}\\), so we have determined the cosine and sine of \\(\\theta\\) in terms of the lengths of the sides of the right triangle. Thus we have the following theorem.\n**Theorem 10.4.** Suppose \\(\\theta\\) is an acute angle residing in a right triangle. If the length of the side adjacent to \\(\\theta\\) is \\(a\\), the length of the side opposite \\(\\theta\\) is \\(b\\), and the length of the hypotenuse is \\(c\\), then \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{a}{c}\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{b}{c}\\).\n**Example 10.2.8.** Find the measure of the missing angle and the lengths of the missing sides of:\n**Solution.** The first and easiest task is to find the measure of the missing angle. Since the sum of angles of a triangle is \\(180^{\\circ}\\), we know that the missing angle has measure \\(180^{\\circ}-30^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}=60^{\\circ}\\). We now proceed to find the lengths of the remaining two sides of the triangle. Let \\(c\\) denote the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. By Theorem 10.4, we have \\(\\cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)=\\frac{7}{c}\\), or \\(c=\\frac{7}{\\cos(30^{\\circ})}\\). Since \\(\\cos\\left(30^{\\circ}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), we have, after the usual fraction gymnastics, \\(c=\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). At this point, we have two ways to proceed to find the length of the side opposite the \\(30^{\\circ}\\) angle, which we'll denote \\(b\\). We know the length of the adjacent side is \\(7\\) and the length of the hypotenuse is \\(\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), so we\ncould use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side and solve \\((7)^{2}+b^{2}=\\left(\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^{2}\\) for \\(b\\). Alternatively, we could use Theorem 10.4, namely that \\(\\sin{(30^{\\circ})}=\\frac{b}{c}\\). Choosing the latter, we find \\(b=c\\sin{(30^{\\circ})}=\\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).

For the vectors \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), find the following. 1. \\(\\hat{v}\\) (b) \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) (c) \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\) (d) \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. We are told that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\) and are given information about its direction, so we can use the formula \\(\\vec{v}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v}\\) to get the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\). To determine \\(\\hat{v}\\), we appeal to Definition 11.8. We are told that \\(\\vec{v}\\) lies in Quadrant II and makes a \\(60^{\\circ}\\) angle with the negative \\(x\\)-axis, so the polar form of the terminal point of \\(\\vec{v}\\), when plotted in standard position is \\((5,120^{\\circ})\\). (See the diagram below.) Thus \\(\\hat{v}=\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(120^{\\circ}\\right),\\sin\\left(120^{\\circ}\\right) \\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right\\rangle\\), so \\(\\vec{v}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\hat{v}=5\\left\\langle-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle-\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right\\rangle\\).\n2. For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=6\\). In light of Definition 11.8, we can find the \\(\\theta\\) we're after by converting the point with rectangular coordinates \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) to polar form \\((r,\\theta)\\) where \\(r=\\|\\vec{v}\\|>0\\). From Section 11.4, we have \\(\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{-3\\sqrt{3}}{3}=-\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) is a point in Quadrant IV, \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant IV angle. Hence, we pick \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). We may check our answer by verifying \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle=6\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3 }\\right),\\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\).\n3. 1. Since we are given the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\), we'll use the formula \\(\\hat{v}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\right)\\vec{v}\\). For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\), we have \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\hat{v}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). 2. We know from our work above that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\), so to find \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\), we need only find \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|=5-2\\sqrt{5}\\). 3. In the expression \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\), notice that the arithmetic on the vectors comes first, then the magnitude. Hence, our first step is to find the component form of the vector \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\). We get \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle-2\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|=\\|\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{65}\\). 4. To find \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\), we first need \\(\\hat{w}\\). Using the formula \\(\\hat{w}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\vec{w}\\) along with \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{5}\\), which we found the in the previous problem, we get \\(\\hat{w}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{5}},-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5},- \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{ 5}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{25}+\\frac{20}{25}}=\\sqrt{1}=1\\).\nThe process exemplified by number 1 in Example 11.8.4 above by which we take information about the magnitude and direction of a vector and find the component form of a vector is called **resolving** a vector into its components. As an application of this process, we revisit Example 11.8.1 below.\n**Example 11.8.5**.: A plane leaves an airport with an airspeed of 175 miles per hour with bearing N40\\({}^{\\circ}\\)E. A 35 mile per hour wind is blowing at a bearing of S60\\({}^{\\circ}\\)E. Find the true speed of the plane, rounded to the nearest mile per hour, and the true bearing of the plane, rounded to the nearest degree.\n**Solution:** We proceed as we did in Example 11.8.1 and let \\(\\vec{v}\\) denote the plane's velocity and \\(\\vec{w}\\) denote the wind's velocity, and set about determining \\(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w}\\). If we regard the airport as being\nat the origin, the positive \\(y\\)-axis acting as due north and the positive \\(x\\)-axis acting as due east, we see that the vectors \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are in standard position and their directions correspond to the angles \\(50^{\\circ}\\) and \\(-30^{\\circ}\\), respectively. Hence, the component form of \\(\\vec{v}=175\\left\\langle\\cos(50^{\\circ}),\\sin(50^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle 1 75\\cos(50^{\\circ}),175\\sin(50^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle\\) and the component form of \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 35\\cos(-30^{\\circ}),35\\sin(-30^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle\\). Since we have no convenient way to express the exact values of cosine and sine of \\(50^{\\circ}\\), we leave both vectors in terms of cosines and sines.13 Adding corresponding components, we find the resultant vector \\(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 175\\cos(50^{\\circ})+35\\cos(-30^{\\circ}),175\\sin(5 0^{\\circ})+35\\sin(-30^{\\circ})\\right\\rangle\\). To find the 'true' speed of the plane, we compute the magnitude of this resultant vector\n\n\n",
