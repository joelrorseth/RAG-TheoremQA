This exercise is about balancing chemical reactions. 1. Chemists denote a molecule of water as H\\({}_{2}\\)O, which means it is composed of two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O). The process by which hydrogen burns is described by the chemical reaction \\[x\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}+y\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\to z\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\\] This means that \\(x\\) molecules of hydrogen H\\({}_{2}\\) combine with \\(y\\) molecules of oxygen O\\({}_{2}\\) to produce \\(z\\) water molecules. The number of hydrogen atoms is the same before and after the reaction; the same is true of the oxygen atoms. 1. In terms of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), how many hydrogen atoms are there before the reaction? How many hydrogen atoms are there after the reaction? Find a linear equation in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) by equating these quantities. 2. Find a second linear equation in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) by equating the number of oxygen atoms before and after the reaction. 3. Find the solutions of this linear system. Why are there infinitely many solutions? 4. In this chemical setting, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) should be positive integers. Find the solution where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are the smallest possible positive integers. 2. Now consider the reaction where potassium permanganate and manganese sulfate combine with water to produce manganese dioxide, potassium sulfate, and sulfuric acid: \\[x_{1}\\,\\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}+x_{2}\\,\\mathrm{MnO}_{4}+x_{3}\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O }\\to x_{4}\\,\\mathrm{MnO}_{2}+x_{5}\\,\\mathrm{K}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}+x_{6}\\, \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}.\\] As in the previous exercise, find the appropriate values for \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{6}\\) to balance the chemical reaction.\n6. We began this section by stating that increasing computational power has helped linear algebra assume a prominent role as a scientific tool. Later, we looked at one computa\ntional limitation: once a matrix gets to be too big, it is not reasonable to apply Gaussian elimination to find its reduced row echelon form. In this exercise, we will see another limitation: computer arithmetic with real numbers is only an approximation because computers represent real numbers with only a finite number of bits. For instance, the number pi \\[\\pi=3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399\\ldots\\] would be approximated inside a computer by, say, \\[\\pi\\approx 3.141592653589793\\] Most of the time, this is not a problem. However, when we perform millions or even billions of arithmetic operations, the error in these approximations starts to accumulate and can lead to results that are wildly inaccurate. Here are two examples demonstrating this. 1. Let's first see an example showing that computer arithmetic really is an approximation. First, consider the linear system \\[x+\\frac{1}{2}y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+\\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] If the coefficients are entered into Sage as fractions, Sage will find the exact reduced row echelon form. Find the exact solution to this linear system.\nNow let's ask Sage to compute with real numbers. We can do this by representing one of the coefficients as a decimal. For instance, the same linear system can be represented as\n\\[x+0.5y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+ \\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+ \\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] Most computers do arithmetic using either 32 or 64 bits. To magnify the problem so that we can see it better, we will ask Sage to do arithmetic using only 10 bits as follows.\n``` R=RealNumber RealNumber=RealField(10)\n#ent\nWhat does Sage give for the solution now? Compare this to the exact solution that you found previously.\n2. Some types of linear systems are particularly sensitive to errors resulting from computers' approximate arithmetic. For instance, suppose we are interested in the linear system \\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2\\] Find the solution to this linear system.\nSuppose now that the computer has accumulated some error in one of the entries of this system so that it incorrectly stores the system as\n\\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2.001\\]\nFind the solution to this linear system.\nNotice how a small error in one of the entries in the linear system leads to a solution that has a dramatically large error. Fortunately, this is an issue that has been well studied, and there are techniques that mitigate this type of behavior.\n## Chapter 1 Systems of Equations\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n6. Suppose we have a set of 10 linear equations in 500 unknowns. Which of the three possibilities would you expect to hold?\n#### 1.1.2 Systems of linear equations\nNow that we have seen some simple examples, let's agree on some terminology to help us think more precisely about sets of equations.\nFirst, we considered a linear equation having the form\n\\[y=2x-1.\\]\nIt will be convenient for us to rewrite this so that all the unknowns are on one side of the\nFigure 1.1.6: Two examples showing the intersections of three planes.\nequation:\n\\[-2x+y=-1.\\]\nMore generally, the equation of a line can always be expressed in the form\n\\[ax+by=c,\\]\nwhich gives us the flexibility to describe all lines. For instance, vertical lines, such as \\(x=3\\), may be represented in this form.\nNotice that each term on the left is the product of a constant and the first power of an unknown. In the future, we will want to consider equations having many more unknowns, which we will sometimes denote as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\). This leads to the following definition:\n**Definition 1.1.7**: A linear equation in the unknowns \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) may be written in the form\n\\[a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}x_{n}=b,\\]\nwhere \\(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) are real numbers known as _coefficients_. We also say that \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) are the _variables_ in the equation.\nBy a **system of linear equations** or a **linear system**, we mean a set of linear equations written in a common set of unknowns.\nFor instance,\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}2x_{1}+&1.2x_{2}-4x_{3}=3.7\\\\ -0.1x_{1}&&+&x_{3}=&2\\\\ x_{1}+&x_{2}-&x_{3}=1.4\\end{array}\\]\nis an example of a linear system.\n**Definition 1.1.8**: A **solution** to a linear system is simply a set of numbers \\(x_{1}=s_{1},x_{2}=s_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}=s_{n}\\) that satisfy all the equations in the system.\nFor instance, we earlier considered the linear system\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}-x+y=&1\\\\ -2x+y=-1.\\end{array}\\]\nTo check that \\((x,y)=(2,3)\\) is a solution, we verify that the following equations are true.\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}-2+3=&1\\\\ -2(2)+3=-1.\\end{array}\\]\n**Definition 1.1.9**: We call the set of all solutions the **solution space** of the linear system.\n**Activity 1.1.3**: **Linear equations and their solutions..**\n* Which of the following equations are linear? Please provide a justification for your response. 1. \\[2x+xy-3y^{2}=2.\\]\n2. \\[-2x_{1}+3x_{2}+4x_{3}-x_{5}=0.\\] 3. \\[x=3z-4y.\\]\n2. Consider the system of linear equations: \\[x+y = 3\\] \\[y-z = 2\\] \\[2x+y+z = 4.\\]\n1. Is \\((x,y,z)=(1,2,0)\\) a solution?\n2. Is \\((x,y,z)=(-2,1,0)\\) a solution?\n3. Is \\((x,y,z)=(0,-3,1)\\) a solution?\n4. Can you find a solution in which \\(y=0\\)?\n5. Do you think there are other solutions? Please explain your response.\n#### Summary\nThe point of this section is to build some intuition about the behavior of solutions to linear systems through consideration of some simple examples. We will develop a deeper and more precise understanding of these phenomena in our future explorations.\n* A linear equation is one that may be written in the form \\[a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}x_{n}=b.\\]\n* A linear system is a set of linear equations and a solution is a set of values assigned to the unknowns that make each equation true.\n* We came to expect that a linear system has either infinitely many solutions, exactly one solution, or no solutions.\n* When we add more equations to a system, the solution space usually seems to become smaller.\n\n\n",

Before we go any further, we should explain why it is possible to represent these operations by matrix transformations. In fact, we ask more generally: what types of functions \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) are represented as matrix transformations?\nThe linearity of matrix-vector multiplication provides the key to answering this question. Remember that if \\(A\\) is a matrix, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) vectors, and \\(c\\) a scalar, then\n\\[A(c\\mathbf{v}) =cA\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =A\\mathbf{v}+A\\mathbf{w}\\dot{}\\]\nThis means that a matrix transformation \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) satisfies the corresponding linearity property:\nLinearity of Matrix Transformations. \\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nIt turns out that, if \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) satisfies these two linearity properties, then we can find a matrix \\(A\\) such that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\). In fact, Proposition 2.5.6 tells us how to form \\(A\\); we simply write\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nWe will now check that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) using the linearity of \\(T\\):\n\\[T(\\mathbf{x})=T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=T(x_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+ x_{n}\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=x_{1}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})+x_{2}T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})+\\ldots+x_{n}T(\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=x_{1}A\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}A\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+x_{n}A\\mathbf{e}_{n}\\]\n\\[=A(x_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+x_{n}\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=A\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\\[=A\\mathbf{x}\\]\nThe result is the following proposition.\n**Proposition 2.6.3**_The function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is a matrix transformation where \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) for some \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) if and only if_\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\n_In this case, \\(A\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{j})\\); that is,_\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots&T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSaid simply, this proposition means says that if have a function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and can verify the two linearity properties stated in the proposition, then we know that \\(T\\) is a matrix transformation. Let's see how this works in practice.\n**Example 2.6.4** We will consider the function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that rotates a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) in the counterclockwise direction to obtain \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as seen in Figure 2.6.5.\nWe first need to know that \\(T\\) can be represented by a matrix transformation, which means, by Proposition 2.6.3, that we need to verify the linearity properties:\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe next two figures illustrate why these properties hold. For instance, Figure 2.6.6 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) when \\(c\\) is a scalar. In particular, scaling a vector and then rotating it is the same as rotating and then scaling it, which means that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. This problem concerns the identification of matrix transformations, about which more will be said in the next section. 1. Check that the following function \\(T:\\mathbf{R}^{3}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{R}^{2}\\) is a matrix transformation by finding a matrix \\(A\\) such that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\). \\[T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{r}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{r}3x_{1}-x_{2}+4x_{3}\\\\ 5x_{2}-x_{3}\\end{array}\\right].\\] 3.

Sketch the vector \\(T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\).\n2. What is the vector \\(T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\)?\n3. Find all the vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) such that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n5. In Example 2.5.5 and Example 2.5.4, we wrote matrix transformations in terms of the\ncomponents of \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\). This exercise makes use of that form. 1. Let's return to the example in Activity 2.5.3 concerning the company that operates two bakeries. We used a matrix transformation with input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), which recorded the amount of time the two bakeries operated, and output \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\), the number of cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs produced. The associated matrix is \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}10&20\\\\ 50&30\\\\ 30&30\\end{bmatrix}\\). 1. If \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\), write the output \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as a three-dimensional vector in terms of \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\). 2. If Bakery 1 operates for \\(x_{1}\\) hours and Bakery 2 for \\(x_{2}\\) hours, how many cakes are produced? 3. Explain how you may have discovered this expression by considering the rates at which the two locations make cakes. 2. Suppose that a bicycle sharing program has two locations \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). Bicycles are rented from some location in the morning and returned to a location in the evening. Suppose that * 60% of bicycles that begin at \\(P\\) in the morning are returned to \\(P\\) in the evening while the other 40% are returned to \\(Q\\). * 30% of bicycles that begin at \\(Q\\) are returned to \\(Q\\) and the other 70% are returned to \\(P\\). 1. If \\(x_{1}\\) is the number of bicycles at location \\(P\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) the number at \\(Q\\) in the morning, write an expression for the number of bicycles at \\(P\\) in the evening. 2. Write an expression for the number of bicycles at \\(Q\\) in the evening. 3. Write an expression for \\(T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\), the vector that describs the distribution of bicycles in the evening. 4. Use this expression to identify the matrix \\(A\\) associated to the matrix transformation \\(T\\). 6. Determine whether the following statements are true or false and provide a justification for your response. 1. A matrix transformation \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{5}\\) is defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is a \\(4\\times 5\\) matrix. 2. If \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) is a matrix transformation, then there are infinitely many vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) such that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{0}\\). 3. If \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) is a matrix transformation, then it is possible that every equation \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{b}\\) has a solution for every vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). 4.

Find the determinant of A. return the numeric.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Preview Activity 4.2.1.** Let's begin by reviewing some important ideas that we have seen previously.\n1. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBy contrast, we have seen that the number of steps required to perform Gaussian elimination on an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix is proportional to \\(n^{3}\\). When \\(n=10\\), we have \\(n^{3}=1000\\), which points to the fact that finding the determinant using Gaussian elimination is considerably less work.\n#### Exercises\n1. Consider the matrices \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}2&1&0\\\\ -4&-4&3\\\\ 2&1&-3\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-2&3&0&0\\\\ 0&4&2&0\\\\ 4&-6&-1&2\\\\ 0&4&2&-3\\end{array}\\right].\\] 2. Find the determinants of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) using row operations. 3. Now find the determinants of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) using cofactor expansions to verify your results\n2. This exercise concerns rotations and reflections in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) is the matrix that performs a counterclockwise rotation in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). Draw a typical picture of the vectors that form the columns of \\(A\\) and use the geometric definition of the determinant to determine \\(\\det(A)\\). 2. Suppose that \\(B\\) is the matrix that performs a reflection in a line passing through the origin. Draw a typical picture of the columns of \\(B\\) and use the geometric definition of the determinant to determine \\(\\det(B)\\). 3. As we saw in Section 2.6, the matrices have the form \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\\cos\\theta&-\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta&\\cos\\theta\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr} \\cos(2\\theta)&\\sin(2\\theta)\\\\ \\sin(2\\theta)&-\\cos(2\\theta)\\end{array}\\right].\\] 3. Compute the determinants of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and verify that they agree with what you found in the earlier parts of this exercise.\n3. In the next chapter, we will say that matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are _similar_ if there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A=PBP^{-1}\\). 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are matrices and that there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A=PBP^{-1}\\). Explain why \\(\\det(A)=\\det(B)\\).\n2. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix and that there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\[A=P\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2&0&0\\\\ 0&-5&0\\\\ 0&0&-3\\end{array}\\right]P^{-1}.\\] Find \\(\\det(A)\\).\n4. Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-2&1&k\\\\ 2&3&0\\\\ 1&2&2\\end{array}\\right]\\] where \\(k\\) is a parameter. 1. Find an expression for \\(\\det(A)\\) in terms of the parameter \\(k\\). 2. Use your expression for \\(\\det(A)\\) to determine the values of \\(k\\) for which the vectors \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 3\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}k\\\\ 0\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly independent.\n5. Determine whether the following statements are true or false and explain your response. 1. If we have a square matrix \\(A\\) and multiply the first row by \\(5\\) and add it to the third row to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=5\\det(A)\\). 2. If we interchange two rows of a matrix, then the determinant is unchanged. 3. If we scale a row of the matrix \\(A\\) by \\(17\\) to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=17\\det(A)\\). 4. If \\(A\\) and \\(A^{\\prime}\\) are row equivalent and \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=0\\), then \\(\\det(A)=0\\) also. 5. If \\(A\\) is row equivalent to the identity matrix, then \\(\\det(A)=\\det(I)=1\\).\n6. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(5\\times 5\\) matrices such that \\(\\det(A)=-2\\) and \\(\\det(B)=5\\). Find the following determinants: 1. \\(\\det(2A)\\). 2. \\(\\det(A^{3})\\). 3. \\(\\det(AB)\\). 4. \\(\\det(-A)\\). 5. \\(\\det(AB^{-1})\\).\n7. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(n\\times n\\) matrices. 1. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both invertible, use determinants to explain why \\(AB\\) is invertible. 2. If \\(AB\\) is invertible, use determinants to explain why both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are invertible.\n**8.**: Provide a justification for your responses to the following questions.\n\n\n",

In the same way, we find that a basis for the eigenspace \\(E_{2}\\) is \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\).\nWe note that, for this matrix, it is possible to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) consisting of eigenvectors, namely,\n\\[\\mathcal{B}=\\left\\{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\right\\}.\\]\n**Example 4.2.5** Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&1\\\\ -1&3\\end{array}\\right]\\) whose characteristic equation is\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=\\lambda^{2}-4\\lambda+4=(\\lambda-2)^{2}=0.\\]\nThere is a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=2\\), and we find that\n\\[A-2\\lambda=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-1&1\\\\ -1&1\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&-1\\\\ 0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTherefore, the eigenspace \\(E_{2}=\\operatorname{Nul}(A-2I)\\) is one-dimensional with a basis vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n**Example 4.2.6** If \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-1&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{array}\\right]\\), then\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda+1)^{2}=0,\\]\nwhich implies that there is a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\). We find that\n\\[A-(-1)I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich says that every two-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) satisfies \\((A-(-1)I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Therefore, every vector is an eigenvector and so \\(E_{-1}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). This eigenspace is two-dimensional.\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n_In this case, \\(A\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{j})\\); that is,_\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots&T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSaid simply, this proposition means says that if have a function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and can verify the two linearity properties stated in the proposition, then we know that \\(T\\) is a matrix transformation. Let's see how this works in practice.\n**Example 2.6.4** We will consider the function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that rotates a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) in the counterclockwise direction to obtain \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as seen in Figure 2.6.5.\nWe first need to know that \\(T\\) can be represented by a matrix transformation, which means, by Proposition 2.6.3, that we need to verify the linearity properties:\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe next two figures illustrate why these properties hold. For instance, Figure 2.6.6 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) when \\(c\\) is a scalar. In particular, scaling a vector and then rotating it is the same as rotating and then scaling it, which means that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nThis leads to \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\). In the same way, we find that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\) so that the matrix \\(A\\) is\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nYou may wish to check this using the interactive diagram in the previous activity using the approximation \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\approx 0.7\\).\nIn this example, we found that \\(T\\), a function describing a rotation in the plane, was in fact a matrix transformation by checking that\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe same kind of thinking applies more generally to show that rotations, reflections, and scalings are matrix transformations. Similarly, we could revisit the functions in Activity 2.5.3 and verify that they are matrix transformations.\n**Activity 2.6.3**. In this activity, we seek to describe various matrix transformations by finding the matrix that gives the desired transformation. All of the transformations that we study here have the form \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\).\n1. Find the matrix of the transformation that has no effect on vectors; that is, \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\).\n\n\n",

We then have \\(-2c_{1}+c_{2}=-13\\), which gives \\(c_{2}=3\\), and \\(c_{1}-c_{2}+c_{3}=8\\), which gives \\(c_{3}=3\\). Solving a triangular system is simplified because we only need to perform a sequence of substitutions.\nIn fact, solving an equation with an \\(n\\times n\\) triangular matrix requires approximately \\(\\frac{1}{2}n^{2}\\) operations. Once we have the factorization \\(A=LU\\), we solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) by solving two equations involving triangular matrices, which requires about \\(n^{2}\\) operations. For example, if \\(A\\) is a \\(1000\\times 1000\\) matrix, we solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) using about one million steps. The compares with roughly a billion operations needed to perform Gaussian elimination, which represents a significant savings. Of course, we have to first find the \\(LU\\) factorization of \\(A\\) and this requires roughly the same amount of work as performing Gaussian elimination. However, once we have the \\(LU\\) factorization, we can use it to solve \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) for different right hand sides \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\nOur discussion so far has ignored one issue, however.

A typical row interchange is represented by multiplication by a matrix such as\n\\[P=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}0&0&1\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 1&0&0\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich has the effect of interchanging the first and third rows. Notice that this matrix is not triangular so performing a row interchange will disrupt the structure of the \\(LU\\) factorization we seek. Without giving the details, we simply note that linear algebra software packages provide a matrix \\(P\\) that describes how the rows are permuted in the Gaussian elimination\nprocess. In particular, we will write \\(PA=LU\\), where \\(P\\) is a permutation matrix, \\(L\\) is lower triangular, and \\(U\\) is upper triangular.\nTherefore, to solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we first multiply both sides by \\(P\\) to obtain\n\\[PA\\mathbf{x}=LU\\mathbf{x}=P\\mathbf{b}.\\]\nThat is, we multiply \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) by \\(P\\) and then find \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) using the factorization: \\(L\\mathbf{c}=P\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(U\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}\\).\n**Activity 5.1.4**.: Sage will create \\(LU\\) factorizations; once we have a matrix \\(\\mathsf{A}\\), we write \\(\\mathsf{P}\\), \\(\\mathsf{L}\\), \\(\\mathsf{U}=\\mathsf{A}.\\mathsf{LU}()\\) to obtain the matrices \\(P\\), \\(L\\), and \\(U\\) such that \\(PA=LU\\).\n1. In Example 5.1.1, we found the \\(LU\\) factorization \\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}2&-3&1\\\\ -4&5&0\\\\ 2&-2&2\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\\\ -2&1&0\\\\ 1&-1&1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}2&-3&1\\\\ 0&-1&2\\\\ 0&0&3\\end{bmatrix}=LU.\\] Using Sage, define the matrix \\(A\\), and then ask Sage for the \\(LU\\) factorization. What are the matrices \\(P\\), \\(L\\), and \\(U\\)? Notice that Sage finds a different \\(LU\\) factorization than we found in the previous activity because Sage uses partial pivoting, as described in the previous section, when it performs Gaussian elimination.\n2. Define the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}8\\\\ -13\\\\ 8\\end{array}\\right]\\) in Sage and compute \\(P\\mathbf{b}\\).\n3. Use the matrices \\(\\mathsf{L}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{U}\\) to solve \\(L\\mathbf{c}=P\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(U\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}\\). You should find the same solution \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) that you found in the previous activity.\n4. Use the factorization to solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}9\\\\ -16\\\\ 10\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n5. How does the factorization show us that \\(A\\) is invertible and that, therefore, every equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) has a unique solution?\n6. Suppose that we have the matrix \\[B=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&2\\\\ 2&-1&1\\\\ 2&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Use Sage to find the \\(LU\\) factorization. Explain how the factorization shows that \\(B\\) is not invertible.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nConvolution reduces to ordinary multiplication of numbers when \\(n=m=1\\), and to scalar-vector multiplication when either \\(n=1\\) or \\(m=1\\). Convolution arises in many applications and contexts.\nAs a specific numerical example, we have \\((1,0,-1)*(2,1,-1)=(2,1,-3,-1,1)\\), where the entries of the convolution result are found from\n\\[2 = (1)(2)\\] \\[1 = (1)(1)+(0)(2)\\] \\[-3 = (1)(-1)+(0)(1)+(-1)(2)\\] \\[-1 = (0)(-1)+(-1)(1)\\] \\[1 = (-1)(-1).\\]\nPolynomial multiplication.If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent the coefficients of two polynomials\n\\[p(x)=a_{1}+a_{2}x+\\cdots+a_{n}x^{n-1},\\qquad q(x)=b_{1}+b_{2}x+\\cdots+b_{m}x^{ m-1},\\]\nthen the coefficients of the product polynomial \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are represented by \\(c=a*b\\):\n\\[p(x)q(x)=c_{1}+c_{2}x+\\cdots+c_{n+m-1}x^{n+m-2}.\\]\nTo see this we will show that \\(c_{k}\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{k-1}\\) in \\(p(x)q(x)\\). We expand the product polynomial into \\(mn\\) terms, and collect those terms associated with \\(x^{k-1}\\). These terms have the form \\(a_{i}b_{j}x^{i+j-2}\\), for \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) that satisfy \\(i+j-2=k-1\\), _i.e._, \\(i+j=k-1\\). It follows that \\(c_{k}=\\sum_{i+j=k+1}a_{i}b_{j}\\), which agrees with the convolution formula (7.2).\nProperties of convolution.Convolution is symmetric: We have \\(a*b=b*a\\). It is also associative: We have \\((a*b)*c=a*(b*c)\\), so we can write both as \\(a*b*c\\). Another property is that \\(a*b=0\\) implies that either \\(a=0\\) or \\(b=0\\). These properties follow from the polynomial coefficient property above, and can also be directly shown. As an example, let us show that \\(a*b=b*a\\). Suppose \\(p\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(a\\), and \\(q\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(b\\). The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients. The coefficients of \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are \\(a*b\\) and the coefficients of \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are \\(b*a\\). These must be the same.\nA basic property is that for fixed \\(a\\), the convolution \\(a*b\\) is a linear function of \\(b\\); and for fixed \\(b\\), it is a linear function of \\(a\\). This means we can express \\(a*b\\) as a matrix-vector product:\n\\[a*b=T(b)a=T(a)b,\\]\nwhere \\(T(b)\\) is the \\((n+m-1)\\times n\\) matrix with entries \\[T(b)_{ij}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}b_{i-j+1}&1\\leq i-j+1\\leq m\\\\ 0&\\text{otherwise}\\end{array}\\right.\\] (7.3) and similarly for \\(T(a)\\). For example, with \\(n=4\\) and \\(m=3\\), we have \\[T(b)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}b_{1}&0&0&0\\\\ b_{2}&b_{1}&0&0\\\\ b_{3}&b_{2}&b_{1}&0\\\\ 0&b_{3}&b_{2}&b_{1}\\\\ 0&0&b_{3}&b_{2}\\\\ 0&0&0&b_{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad T(a)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}a_{1}&0&0 \\\\ a_{2}&a_{1}&0\\\\ a_{3}&a_{2}&a_{1}\\\\ a_{4}&a_{3}&a_{2}\\\\ 0&a_{4}&a_{3}\\\\ 0&0&a_{4}\\end{array}\\right].\\] The matrices \\(T(b)\\) and \\(T(a)\\) are called _Toeplitz_ matrices (named after the mathematician Otto Toeplitz), which means the entries on any diagonal (_i.e._, indices with \\(i-j\\) constant) are the same. The columns of the Toeplitz matrix \\(T(a)\\) are simply shifted versions of the vector \\(a\\), padded with zero entries.\nVariations.Several slightly different definitions of convolution are used in different applications. In one variation, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are infinite two-sided sequences (and not vectors) with indices ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\). In another variation, the rows of \\(T(a)\\) at the top and bottom that do not contain all the coefficients of \\(a\\) are dropped. (In this version, the rows of \\(T(a)\\) are shifted versions of the vector \\(a\\), reversed.) For consistency, we will use the one definition (7.2).\nExamples.\n* _Time series smoothing._ Suppose the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is a time series, and \\(a=(1/3,1/3,1/3)\\). Then the \\((n+2)\\)-vector \\(y=a*x\\) can be interpreted as a _smoothed_ version of the original time series: for \\(i=3,\\ldots,n\\), \\(y_{i}\\) is the average of \\(x_{i}\\), \\(x_{i-1}\\), \\(x_{i-2}\\). The time series \\(y\\) is called the (3-period) _moving average_ of the time series \\(x\\). Figure 7.6 shows an example.\n\n\n",

Compare to the flop count for the naive method.\n_Remark_.: A further trick called the matrix inversion lemma (which is beyond the scope of this book) can be used to reduce the complexity of recursive least squares to order \\(mn^{2}\\).\n**12.15**: _Minimizing a squared norm plus an affine function._ A generalization of the least squares problem (12.1) adds an affine function to the least squares objective,\n\\[\\text{minimize}\\quad\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+c^{T}x+d,\\]\nwhere the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is the variable to be chosen, and the (given) data are the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\), the \\(n\\)-vector \\(c\\), and the number \\(d\\).

Algorithm 12.1 uses the QR factorization to compute the least squares approximate solution \\(\\hat{x}=A^{\\dagger}b\\), where the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns. It has a complexity of \\(2mn^{2}\\) flops. In this exercise we consider an alternative method: First, form the Gram matrix \\(G=A^{T}A\\) and the vector \\(h=A^{T}b\\); and then compute \\(\\hat{x}=G^{-1}h\\) (using algorithm 11.2). What is the complexity of this method? Compare it to algorithm 12.1. _Remark_. You might find that the Gram algorithm appears to be a bit faster than the QR method, but the factor is not large enough to have any practical significance. The idea is useful in situations where \\(G\\) is partially available and can be computed more efficiently than by multiplying \\(A\\) and its transpose.

When we choose a polynomial whose degree is too high, we give the noise too much weight in the model, which leads to some undesirable behavior, like the wiggles in the graph.

To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\n\n",

When we begin\nour study, the populations, measured in thousands, are \\(R_{0}\\) and \\(S_{0}\\); after \\(k\\) years, the populations are \\(R_{k}\\) and \\(S_{k}\\). If we know the populations in one year, suppose that the populations in the following year are determined by the expressions \\[R_{k+1} =0.9R_{k}+0.8S_{k}\\] \\[S_{k+1} =0.2R_{k}+0.9S_{k}.\\] This is an example of a mutually beneficial relationship between two species. If species \\(S\\) is not present, then \\(R_{k+1}=0.9R_{k}\\), which means that the population of species \\(R\\) decreases every year. However, species \\(R\\) benefits from the presence of species \\(S\\), which helps \\(R\\) to grow by \\(80\\%\\) of the population of species \\(S\\). In the same way, \\(S\\) benefits from the presence of \\(R\\). We will record the populations in a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}R_{k}\\\\ S_{k}\\end{array}\\right]\\) and note that \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) where \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.9&0.8\\\\ 0.2&0.9\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n1. Verify that \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] are eigenvectors of \\(A\\) and find their respective eigenvalues.\n2. Suppose that initially \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\). Write \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n3. Write the vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\) as linear combinations of the eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n4. What happens to \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) after a very long time?\n5. When \\(k\\) becomes very large, what happens to the ratio of the populations \\(R_{k}/S_{k}\\)?\n6. After a very long time, by approximately what factor does the population of \\(R\\) grow every year? By approximately what factor does the population of \\(S\\) grow every year?\n7. If we begin instead with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right]\\), what eventually happens to the ratio \\(R_{k}/S_{k}\\) as \\(k\\) becomes very large?\nThis activity demonstrates the type of systems we will be considering. In particular, we will have vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) that describe the state of the system at time \\(k\\) and a matrix \\(A\\) that describes how the state evolves from one time to the next: \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(A\\) provide the key that helps us understand how the vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) evolve and that enables us to make long-range predictions.\nLet's look at the specific example in the previous activity more carefully. We see that\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.9&0.8\\\\ 0.2&0.9\\end{array}\\right]\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\]\nand that the matrix \\(A\\) has eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) with associated eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}=1.3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=0.5\\).\nWith initial populations \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\), we have\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{0} =2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}_{1} =1.3\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.5\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}_{2} =1.3^{2}\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.5^{2}\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}_{k} =1.3^{k}\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.5^{k}\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nLet's shift our perspective slightly. The eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) form a basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), which says that \\(A\\) is diagonalizable; that is, \\(A=PDP^{-1}\\) where\n\\[P=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\end{array}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&-2\\\\ 1&1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1.3&0\\\\ 0&0.5\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe coordinate system defined by the basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) can be used to express the state vectors. For instance, we can write the initial state vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]=2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), which means that \\(\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). Moreover, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{0}=(1.3)\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+(0.5)\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) so that\n\\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.3\\cdot 2 \\\\ 0.5\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]=D\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]=D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}.\\]\nIn the same way,\n\\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}1.3\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}1.3^{2}\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5^{2}\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}1.3^{3}\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5^{3}\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.3^{k}\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5^{k}\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nMore generally, we have\n\\[\\left\\{A\\mathbf{x}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}\\right\\}_{ \\mathcal{B}},\\]\nwhich is a restatement of the fact that \\(A\\) is similar to \\(D\\).\n\n\n",

If \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), find the product \\(Q^{T}Q\\) and explain your result.\nThis activity demonstrates one issue of note. We found \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\), by requiring that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) be orthogonal to \\(W\\). In other words, \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is a vector in the orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\), which we may denote \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\). This explains the following proposition, which is illustrated in Figure 6.3.19\n**Proposition 6.3.18**: _If \\(W\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) with orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\), then any \\(n\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) can be uniquely written as_\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}+\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\]\n_where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W^{\\perp}\\)._\nLet's summarize what we've found. If \\(Q\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) form an orthonormal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then\n* \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix, because this product computes the dot products between the columns of \\(Q\\).\n* \\(QQ^{T}\\) is the matrix the projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\).\nAs we've said before, matrix multiplication depends on the order in which we multiply the matrices, and we see this clearly here.\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\nFigure 6.3.19: A vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) along with \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the line \\(L\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement \\(L^{\\perp}\\).\n**Example 6.3.20** Consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn this case, \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) span a plane, a 2-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\). We know that \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{2}\\) and \\(QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto the plane. However, \\(Q\\) is not a square matrix so it cannot be invertible.\n**Example 6.3.21** Now consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -2/\\sqrt{6}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\n\n",

For each of the following geometric operations in the plane, find a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix that defines the matrix transformation performing the operation. 1. Rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\). 2. Reflects vectors across the vertical axis. 3. Reflects vectors across the line \\(y=-x\\). 4. Rotates vectors counterclockwise by \\(60^{\\circ}\\). 5. First rotates vectors counterclockwise by \\(60^{\\circ}\\) and then reflects in the line \\(y=x\\).\n2. This exercise investigates the composition of reflections in the plane. 1. Find the result of first reflecting across the line \\(y=0\\) and then \\(y=x\\). What familiar operation is the cumulative effect of this composition? 2. What happens if you compose the operations in the opposite order; that is, what happens if you first reflect across \\(y=x\\) and then \\(y=0\\)? What familiar operation results? 3. What familiar geometric operation results if you first reflect across the line \\(y=x\\) and then \\(y=-x\\)? 4. What familiar geometric operation results if you first rotate by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) and then reflect across the line \\(y=x\\)? It is a general fact that the composition of two reflections results in a rotation through twice the angle from the first line of reflection to the second. We will investigate this more generally in Exercise 2.6.4.8\n3. Shown below in Figure 2.6.19 are the vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{3}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\). 1. Imagine that the thumb of your right hand points in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\). A positive\nrotation about the \\(x\\) axis corresponds to a rotation in the direction in which your fingers point. Find the matrix defining the matrix transformation \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) around the \\(x\\)-axis. 2. In the same way, find the matrix that rotates vectors by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) around the \\(y\\)-axis. 3. Find the matrix that rotates vectors by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) around the \\(z\\)-axis. 4. What is the cumulative effect of rotating by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis, followed by a \\(90^{\\circ}\\) rotation about the \\(y\\)-axis, followed by a \\(-90^{\\circ}\\) rotation about the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe past few sections introduced us to matrix-vector multiplication as a means of thinking geometrically about the solutions to a linear system. In particular, we rewrote a linear system as a matrix equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) and developed the concepts of span and linear independence in response to our two fundamental questions.\nIn this section, we will explore how matrix-vector multiplication defines certain types of functions, which we call _matrix transformations_, similar to those encountered in previous algebra courses. In particular, we will develop some algebraic tools for thinking about matrix transformations and look at some motivating examples. In the next section, we will see how matrix transformations describe important geometric operations and how they are used in computer animation.\n**Preview Activity 2.5.1.** We will begin by considering a more familiar situation; namely, the function \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\), which takes a real number \\(x\\) as an input and produces its square \\(x^{2}\\) as its output.\n1. What is the value of \\(f(3)\\)?\n2. Can we solve the equation \\(f(x)=4\\)? If so, is the solution unique?\n3. Can we solve the equation \\(f(x)=-10\\)? If so, is the solution unique?\n4. Sketch a graph of the function \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) in Figure 2.5.1\nWe will now consider functions having the form \\(g(x)=mx\\). Draw a graph of the function \\(g(x)=2x\\) on the left in Figure 2.5.2.\nFigure 2.5.1: Graph the function \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) above.\n. Draw a graph of the function \\(h(x)=-\\frac{1}{3}x\\) on the right of Figure 2.5.2.\n2. Remember that composing two functions means we use the output from one function as the input into the other; that is, \\((g\\circ h)(x)=g(h(x))\\). What function results from composing \\((g\\circ h)(x)\\)?\n#### Matrix transformations\nIn the preview activity, we considered familiar linear functions of a single variable, such as \\(g(x)=2x\\). We construct a function like this by choosing a number \\(m\\); when given an input \\(x\\), the output \\(g(x)=mx\\) is formed by multiplying \\(x\\) by \\(m\\).\nIn this section, we will consider functions whose inputs are vectors and whose outputs are vectors defined through matrix-vector multiplication. That is, if \\(A\\) is a matrix and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a vector, the function \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) forms the product \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) as its output. Such a function is called a matrix transformation.\n**Definition 2.5.3** The **matrix transformation** associated to the matrix \\(A\\) is the function that assigns to the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) the vector \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\); that is, \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\).\n**Example 2.5.4** The matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}3&-2\\\\ 1&2\\\\ 0&3\\end{bmatrix}\\) defines a matrix transformation \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) in the following way:\n\\[T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=\\begin{bmatrix}3&-2\\\\ 1&2\\\\ 0&3\\end{bmatrix}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3x_{1}-2x_{2}\\\\ x_{1}+2x_{2}\\\\ 3x_{2}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nNotice that the input to \\(T\\) is a two-dimensional vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\) and the output is a three-dimensional vector.\nFigure 2.5.2: Graphs of the function \\(g(x)=2x\\) and \\(h(x)=-\\frac{1}{3}x\\).\ndimensional vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3x_{1}-2x_{2}\\\\ x_{1}+2x_{2}\\\\ 3x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). As a shorthand, we will write\n\\[T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\]\nto indicate that the inputs are two-dimensional vectors and the outputs are three-dimensional vectors.\n**Example 2.5.5** Suppose we have a function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that has the form\n\\[T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-4x_{1}-x_{2}+2x_{3}\\\\ x_{1}+2x_{2}-x_{3}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nWe may write\n\\[T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}-4x_{1}\\\\ x_{1}+2x_{2}-x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[= \\left[\\begin{array}{c}-4x_{1}\\\\ x_{1}\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-x_{2}\\\\ 2x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2x_{3}\\\\ -x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[= x_{1}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-4\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]+x_{2}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]+x_{3}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[= \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-4&-1&2\\\\ 1&2&-1\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis shows that \\(T\\) is a matrix transformation \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) associated to the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-4&-1&2\\\\ 1&2&-1\\end{array}\\right].\\)\n**Activity 2.5.2**.: In this activity, we will look at some examples of matrix transformations.\n\n\n",

Since every row contains at most one pivot position, the number of columns can be no greater than the number of rows. This means that the number of vectors in a linearly independent set can be no greater than the number of dimensions.\n**Proposition 2.4.7**: _A linearly independent set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) contains at most \\(m\\) vectors._\nThis says, for instance, that any linearly independent set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) can contain no more three vectors. We usually imagine three independent directions, such as up/down, front/back, left/right, in our three-dimensional world. This proposition tells us that there can be no more independent directions.\nThe proposition above says that a set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) that is linear independent has at most \\(m\\) vectors. By comparison, Proposition 2.3.15 says that a set of vectors whose span is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) has at least \\(m\\) vectors.\n#### Homogeneous equations\nIf \\(A\\) is a matrix, we call the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) a _homogeneous_ equation. As we'll see, the uniqueness of solutions to this equation reflects on the linear independence of the columns of \\(A\\).\n**Activity 2.4.3**: **Linear independence and homogeneous equations..**\n1.

Describe the solution space of the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) using a parametric description, if appropriate.\n3. Find a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation and use it to find weights \\(c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\), and \\(c_{3}\\) such that \\[c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\mathbf{0}.\\]\n* Use the equation you found in the previous part to write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others.\n* Are the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) linearly dependent or independent?\nThis activity shows how the solution space of the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) indicates whether the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly dependent or independent. First, we know that the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) always has at least one solution, the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Any other solution is a nonzero solution.\n**Example 2.4.8** Let's consider the vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -4\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 3\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ -3\\\\ 4\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand their associated matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\end{bmatrix}\\).\nThe homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has the associated augmented matrix\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}2&1&3\\\\ -4&1&-3\\\\ 1&3&4\\\\ 0&-2&-2\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&0&1&0\\\\ 0&1&1&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTherefore, \\(A\\) has a column without a pivot position, which tells us that the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) are linearly dependent. However, we can also see this fact in another way.\nThe reduced row echelon matrix tells us that the homogeneous equation has a free variable so that there must be infinitely many solutions. In particular, we have\n\\[x_{1}= -x_{3}\\] \\[x_{2}= -x_{3}\\]\nso the solutions have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-x_{3}\\\\ -x_{3}\\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]=x_{3}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\n\n",

The constant term is omitted in the model because it would be redundant: It has the same effect as adding a constant to the parameters \\(\\theta_{2},\\ldots,\\theta_{P+1}\\).\nThe least squares fit is computed by minimizing \\(\\|A\\theta-y^{\\rm d}\\|^{2}\\) where \\(\\theta\\) is a \\((P+1)\\)-vector and the matrix \\(A\\) in (13.1) is given by\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\ 2&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ P&0&0&\\cdots&1\\\\ P+1&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\ P+2&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 2P&0&0&\\cdots&1\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots\\\\ N-P+1&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\ N-P+2&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ N&0&0&\\cdots&1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn this example, \\(N=15P=180\\).

In this case the matrix \\(A\\) in (13.1) has the form\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&x^{(1)}&\\cdots&(x^{(1)})^{p-1}\\\\ 1&x^{(2)}&\\cdots&(x^{(2)})^{p-1}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots\\\\ 1&x^{(N)}&\\cdots&(x^{(N)})^{p-1}\\end{array}\\right],\\]\n_i.e._, it is a Vandermonde matrix (see (6.7)). Its columns are linearly independent provided the numbers \\(x^{(1)},\\ldots,x^{(N)}\\) include at least \\(p\\) different values. Figure 13.6 shows an example of the least squares fit of polynomials of degree 2, 6, 10, and 15 to a set of 100 data points. Since any polynomial of degree less than \\(r\\) is also a polynomial of degree less than \\(s\\), for \\(r\\leq s\\), it follows that the RMS fit attained by a polynomial with a larger degree is smaller (or at least, no larger) than that obtained by a fit with a smaller degree polynomial. This suggests that we should use the largest degree polynomial that we can, since this results in the smallest residual and the best RMS fit. But we will see in SS13.2 that this is not true, and explore rational methods for choosing a model from among several candidates.\nPiecewise-linear fit.A _piecewise-linear_ function, with _knot points_ or _kink points_\\(a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{k}\\), is a continuous function that is affine in between the knot points. (Such functions should be called piecewise-affine.) We can describe any\nFigure 13.6: Least squares polynomial fits of degree 2, 6, 10, and 15 to 100 points.\npiecewise-linear function with \\(k\\) knot points using the \\(p=k+2\\) basis functions\n\\[f_{1}(x)=1,\\qquad f_{2}(x)=x,\\qquad f_{i+2}(x)=(x-a_{i})_{+},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,k,\\]\nwhere \\((u)_{+}=\\max\\{u,0\\}\\).

Frequently, however, we focus on only a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\). In particular, if we are given an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we have been interested in both the span of the columns of \\(A\\) and the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). In this section, we will expand the concept of basis to describe sets like these.\n**Preview Activity 3.5.1.** Let's consider the following matrix \\(A\\) and its reduced row echelon form.\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr}2&-1&2&3\\\\ 1&0&0&2\\\\ -2&2&-4&-2\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr}1&0&0&2\\\\ 0&1&-2&1\\\\ 0&0&0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n1. Are the columns of \\(A\\) linearly independent? Is the span of the columns \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\)?\n2. Give a parametric description of the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n3. Explain how this parametric description produces two vectors \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\) whose span is the solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n4. What can you say about the linear independence of the set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\)?\n5. Let's denote the columns of \\(A\\) as \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\). Explain why \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) can be written as linear combinations of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n6. Explain why \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are linearly independent and \\[\\text{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}=\\text{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3},\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\}.\\]\n#### Subspaces\nOur goal is to develop a common framework for describing subsets like the span of the columns of a matrix and the solution space to a homogeneous equation. That leads us to the following definition.\n**Definition 3.5.1** A **subspace** of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) that is the span of a set of vectors.\nSince we have explored the concept of span in some detail, this definition just gives us a new word to describe something familiar. Let's look at some examples.\n**Example 3.5.2**: **Subspaces of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).** In Activity 2.3.3 and the following discussion, we looked at subspaces in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) without explicitly using that language. Let's recall some of those examples.\n* Suppose we have a single nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The span of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a subspace, which we'll write as \\(S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}\\}\\). As we have seen, the span of a single vector consists of all scalar multiples of that vector, and these form a line passing through the origin.\n* If instead we have two linearly independent vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), the subspace \\(S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}\\) is a plane passing through the origin.\n* Consider the three vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{3}\\). Since we know that every \\(3\\)-dimensional vector can be written as a linear combination, we have \\(S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{e}_{1},\\mathbf{e}_{2},\\mathbf{e}_{3}\\}=\\mathbb{ R}^{3}\\).\n* One more subspace worth mentioning is \\(S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}\\). Since any linear combination of the zero vector is itself the zero vector, this subspace consists of a single vector, \\(\\mathbf{0}\\).\nIn fact, any subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) is one of these types: the origin, a line, a plane, or all of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\n**Activity 3.5.2**.: We will look at some sets of vectors and the subspaces they form.\n* If \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) is a set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), explain why \\(\\mathbf{0}\\) can be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors. Use this fact to explain why the zero vector \\(\\mathbf{0}\\) belongs to any subspace in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\n\n\n",

Use cramer's rule to solve these three variables.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nFollowing standard mathematical language usage, we will say \"The vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly dependent\" to mean \"The list of vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) is linearly dependent\". But it must be remembered that linear dependence is an attribute of a _collection_ of vectors, and not individual vectors.\nLinearly independent vectors.A collection of \\(n\\)-vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) (with \\(k\\geq 1\\)) is called _linearly independent_ if it is not linearly dependent, which means that\n\\[\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{k}a_{k}=0\\] (5.1)\nonly holds for \\(\\beta_{1}=\\cdots=\\beta_{k}=0\\). In other words, the only linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector is the linear combination with all coefficients zero.\nAs with linear dependence, we will say \"The vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly independent\" to mean \"The list of vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) is linearly independent\". But, like linear dependence, linear independence is an attribute of a collection of vectors, and not individual vectors.\nIt is generally not easy to determine by casual inspection whether or not a list of vectors is linearly dependent or linearly independent. But we will soon see an algorithm that does this.\n#### Examples.\n* A list consisting of a single vector is linearly dependent only if the vector is zero. It is linearly independent only if the vector is nonzero.\n* Any list of vectors containing the zero vector is linearly dependent.\n* A list of two vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors is a multiple of the other one. More generally, a list of vectors is linearly dependent if any one of the vectors is a multiple of another one.\n* The vectors \\[a_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.2\\\\ -7.0\\\\ 8.6\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-0.1\\\\ 2.0\\\\ -1.0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.0\\\\ -1.0\\\\ 2.2\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly dependent, since \\(a_{1}+2a_{2}-3a_{3}=0\\). We can express any of these vectors as a linear combination of the other two. For example, we have \\(a_{2}=(-1/2)a_{1}+(3/2)a_{3}\\).\n* The vectors \\[a_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly independent. To see this, suppose \\(\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\beta_{2}a_{2}+\\beta_{3}a_{3}=0\\). This means that \\[\\beta_{1}-\\beta_{3}=0,\\qquad-\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}=0,\\qquad\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}=0.\\] Adding the last two equations we find that \\(2\\beta_{3}=-0\\), so \\(\\beta_{3}=0\\). Using this, the first equation is then \\(\\beta_{1}=0\\), and the second equation is \\(\\beta_{2}=0\\).\n* The standard unit \\(n\\)-vectors \\(e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}\\) are linearly independent. To see this, suppose that (5.1) holds. We have \\[0=\\beta_{1}e_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{n}e_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\beta_{1}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_{n}\\end{array}\\right],\\] so we conclude that \\(\\beta_{1}=\\cdots=\\beta_{n}=0\\).\nLinear combinations of linearly independent vectors.Suppose a vector \\(x\\) is a linear combination of \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\),\n\\[x=\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{k}a_{k}.\\]\nWhen the vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly independent, the coefficients that form \\(x\\) are _unique_: If we also have\n\\[x=\\gamma_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\gamma_{k}a_{k},\\]\nthen \\(\\beta_{i}=\\gamma_{i}\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots,k\\). This tells us that, in principle at least, we can find the coefficients that form a vector \\(x\\) as a linear combination of linearly independent vectors.\nTo see this, we subtract the two equations above to get\n\\[0=(\\beta_{1}-\\gamma_{1})a_{1}+\\cdots+(\\beta_{k}-\\gamma_{k})a_{k}.\\]\nSince \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly independent, we conclude that \\(\\beta_{i}-\\gamma_{i}\\) are all zero.\nThe converse is also true: If each linear combination of a list of vectors can only be expressed as a linear combination with one set of coefficients, then the list of vectors is linearly independent. This gives a nice interpretation of linear independence: A list of vectors is linearly independent if and only if for any linear combination of them, we can infer or deduce the associated coefficients. (We will see later how to do this.)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWhen writing a linear system, we always write the variables in the same order in each equation. We then construct an _augmented matrix_ by simply forgetting about the variables and recording the numerical data in a rectangular array. For instance, the system of equations below has the following augmented matrix\n\\[\\begin{array}{lcl}-x-2y+2z&=&-1\\\\ 2x+4y-\\ z&=&5\\\\ x+2y&=&3\\end{array}\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-1&-2& 2\\\\ 2&4&-1\\\\ 1&2&0\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{r}-1\\\\ 5\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe vertical line reminds us where the equals signs appear in the equations. Entries in the matrix to the left of the vertical line correspond to coefficients of the equations. We sometimes choose to focus only on the coefficients of the system in which case we write the _coefficient matrix_ as\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-1&-2&2\\\\ 2&4&-1\\\\ 1&2&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe three operations we perform on systems of equations translate naturally into operations on matrices. For instance, the replacement operation that multiplies the first equation by 2 and adds it to the second may be performed by multiplying the first row of the augmented matrix by 2 and adding it to the second row:\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-1&-2&2\\\\ 2&4&-1\\\\ 1&2&0\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-1&-2&2\\\\ 0&0&3\\\\ 1&2&0\\end{array}\\right]-1\\]\nThe symbol \\(\\sim\\) between the matrices indicates that the two matrices are related by a sequence of scaling, interchange, and replacement operations. Since these operations act on the rows of the matrices, we say that the matrices are _row equivalent_. Notice that the linear systems corresponding to two row equivalent augmented matrices have the same solution space.\n**Activity 1.2.3**: **Augmented matrices and solution spaces..**\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the linear system \\[\\begin{array}{rr}x+2y-\\ z&=&1\\\\ 3x+2y+2z&=&7\\\\ -x\\qquad+4z&=&-3\\end{array}\\] and perform Gaussian elimination to describe the solution space in as much detail as you can.\n2. Suppose that you have a linear system in the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) whose aug\nmented matrix is row equivalent to \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}1&0&3\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\] Write the linear system corresponding to this augmented matrix and describe its solution set in as much detail as you can. 3.

Suppose that the augmented matrix of a linear system has the following shape where \\(\\star\\) could be any real number. \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\\star&\\ast&\\ast&\\ast&\\ast\\\\ \\star&\\ast&\\ast&\\ast&\\ast\\\\ \\star&\\ast&\\ast&\\ast&\\ast\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n1. How many equations are there in this system and how many variables? 2. Based on our earlier discussion in Section 1.1, do you think it's possible that this system has exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions? 3. Suppose that this augmented matrix is row equivalent to \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&2&0&0&3\\\\ 0&0&1&2&-1\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\] Make a choice for the names of the variables and write the corresponding linear system. Does the system have exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions?\n#### Reduced row echelon form\nThere is a special class of matrices whose form makes it especially easy to describe the solution space of the corresponding linear system. As we describe the properties of this class of\nmatrices, it may be helpful to consider an example, such as the following matrix.\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc}1&*&0&*&0&*\\\\ 0&0&1&*&0&*\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&*\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\n\n",

In Figure 1.1, we are looking at equations in two unknowns. Here we see that\n* One equation has infinitely many solutions.\n* Two equations have exactly one solution.\n* Three equations have no solutions.\nFigure 1.1.1 Three possible graphs for sets of linear equations in two unknowns.\n### 1.1 What can we expect\nIt seems reasonable to wonder if the number of solutions depends on whether the number of equations is less than, equal to, or greater than the number of unknowns. Of course, one of the examples in the activity shows that there are exceptions to this simple rule, as seen in Figure 1.1.2. For instance, two equations in two unknowns may correspond to parallel lines so that the set of equations has no solutions. It may also happen that a set of three equations in two unknowns has a single solution. However, it seems safe to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of solutions will be.\nLet's also consider some examples of equations having three unknowns, which we call \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Just as solutions to linear equations in two unknowns formed straight lines, solutions to linear equations in three unknowns form planes.\nWhen we consider an equation in three unknowns graphically, we need to add a third coordinate axis, as shown in Figure 1.1.3.\nAs shown in Figure 1.1.4, a linear equation in two unknowns, such as \\(y=0\\), is a line while a linear equation in three unknowns, such as \\(z=0\\), is a plane.\nFigure 1.1.2: A set of two equations in two unknowns can have no solutions, and a set of three equations can have one solution.\nIn three unknowns, the set of solutions to one linear equation forms a plane. The set of solutions to a pair of linear equations is seen graphically as the intersection of the two planes. As in Figure 1.1.5, we typically expect this intersection to be a line.\n**Figure 1.1.5** A single plane and the intersection of two planes.\nWhen we add a third equation, we are looking for the intersection of three planes, which we expect to form a point, as in the left of Figure 1.1.6. However, in certain special cases, it may happen that there are no solutions, as seen on the right.\n**Active 1.1.2**.: This activity considers sets of equations having three unknowns.

Is it possible that there are no solutions to two linear equations in three unknowns? Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.\n2.

Give an example of a \\(3\\times 5\\) matrix that has the largest possible number of pivot positions.\n3. How many pivots can there be in one column? In a \\(5\\times 3\\) matrix, what is the largest possible number of pivot positions? Give an example of a \\(5\\times 3\\) matrix that has the largest possible number of pivot positions.\n4. Give an example of a matrix with a pivot position in every row and every column. What is special about such a matrix?\nWhen we have looked at solution spaces of linear systems, we have frequently asked whether there are infinitely many solutions, exactly one solution, or no solutions. We will now break this question into two separate questions.\n**Question 1.1.2 Two Fundamental Questions.** When we encounter a linear system, we often ask\n**Existence**: Is there a solution to the linear system? If so, we say that the system is _consistent_; if not, we say it is _inconsistent_.\n**Uniqueness**: If the linear system is consistent, is the solution unique or are there infinitely many solutions?\nThese two questions represent two sides of a coin that appear in many variations throughout our explorations. In this section, we will study how the location of the pivots influence the answers to these two questions. We begin by considering the first question concerning the existence of solutions.\n#### The existence of solutions\n**Activity 1.4.2**.:\n1. Shown below are three augmented matrices in reduced row echelon form. \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&0&0\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&1\\\\ 0&0&0\\end{array}\\right]\\qquad\\qquad\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&0&2&3\\\\ 0&1&-1&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0\\end{array}\\right]\\qquad\\qquad\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&0&2&0\\\\ 0&1&-1&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1\\\\ 0&0&0&0\\end{array}\\right]\\] For each matrix, identify the pivot positions and determine if the corresponding linear system is consistent. Explain how the location of the pivots determines whether the system is consistent or inconsistent. 2. Each of the augmented matrices above has a row in which each entry is zero. What, if anything, does the presence of such a row tell us about the consistency of the corresponding linear system? 3. Give an example of a \\(3\\times 5\\) augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form that represents a consistent system. Indicate the pivot positions in your matrix and explain why these pivot positions guarantee a consistent system. 4. Give an example of a \\(3\\times 5\\) augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form that represents an inconsistent system. Indicate the pivot positions in your matrix and explain why these pivot positions guarantee an inconsistent system. 5. Write the reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix of the corresponding linear system in Item d? (Remember that the Augmentation Principle says that the reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix simply consists of the first four columns of the augmented matrix.) What do you notice about the pivot positions in this coefficient matrix? 6. Suppose we have a linear system for which the _coefficient_ matrix has the follow\n\n\n",

How do the left singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\) provide an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n* Remember that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) is the dimension of the column space. What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) and how do the number of nonzero singular values determine \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\)?\nThis activity shows how a singular value decomposition of a matrix encodes important information about its null and column spaces. More specifically, the left and right singular vectors provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This is one of the reasons that singular value decompositions are so useful.\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{r}&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nThe first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\):\n\\[U=\\left[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{r}}_{\\operatorname{Col}(A)} \\ \\mathbf{u}_{r+1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{m}\\right]\\]\nand the last \\(n-r\\) columns of \\(V\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\):\n\\[V=\\left[\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{r}\\ \\underbrace{\\mathbf{v}_{r+1} \\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{n}}_{\\operatorname{Nul}(A)}\\right]\\]\nRemember that Proposition 7.4.6 says that \\(A\\) and its transpose \\(A^{T}\\) share the same singular values. Since the rank of a matrix equals its number of nonzero singular values, this means that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T})\\), a fact that we cited back in Section 6.2.\n**Proposition 7.4.8**: _For any matrix \\(A\\),_\n\\[\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T}).\\]\nIf we have a singular value decomposition of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\), Proposition 7.4.6 also tells us that the left singular vectors of \\(A\\) are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). Therefore, \\(U\\) is the \\(m\\times m\\) matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). This means that the last \\(m-r\\) vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\). Therefore, the columns of \\(U\\) provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\):\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nHow would you form a matrix that projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)?\n### 7.5.1 Least-squares problems\nLeast-squares problems, which we explored in Section 6.5, arise when we are confronted with an inconsistent linear system \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\). Since there is no solution to the system, we instead find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) minimizing the distance between \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\). That is, we find the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\), the least-squares approximate solution, by solving \\(A\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto the column space of \\(A\\).\nIf we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\), then the number of nonzero singular values \\(r\\) tells us the rank of \\(A\\), and the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This basis may be used to project vectors onto \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) and hence to solve least-squares problems.\nBefore exploring this connection further, we will introduce Sage as a tool for automating the construction of singular value decompositions. One new feature is that we need to declare our matrix to consist of floating point entries. We do this by including RDF inside the matrix definition, as illustrated in the following cell.\nA = matrix(RDF, 3, 2, [1,0,-1,1,1,1]) U, Sigma, V = A.SVD() print(U) print('-------') print(Sigma) print('-------') print(V)\n**Activity 7.5.2**.: Consider the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) where\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\ 1&1\\\\ 1&2\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 3\\\\ 6\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n1. Find a singular value decomposition for \\(A\\) using the Sage cell below. What are singular values of \\(A\\)?\n2. What is \\(r\\), the rank of \\(A\\)? How can we identify an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n3. Form the reduced singular value decomposition \\(U_{r}\\Sigma_{r}V_{r}^{T}\\) by constructing: the matrix \\(U_{r}\\), consisting of the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\); the matrix \\(V_{r}\\), consisting of the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(V\\); and \\(\\Sigma_{r}\\), a square \\(r\\times r\\) diagonal matrix. Verify that \\(A=U_{r}\\Sigma_{r}V_{r}^{T}\\). You may find it convenient to remember that if B is a matrix defined in Sage, then B.matrix_from_columns( list ) and B.matrix_from_rows( list ) can be used to extract columns or rows from B. For instance, B.matrix_from_rows([0,1,2]) provides a matrix formed from the first three rows of B.\n4. How does the reduced singular value decomposition provide a matrix whose columns are an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n5. Explain why a least-squares approximate solution \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\) satisfies \\[A\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=U_{r}U_{r}^{T}\\mathbf{b}.\\]\n6. What is the product \\(V_{r}^{T}V_{r}\\) and why does it have this form?\n7. Explain why \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=V_{r}\\Sigma_{r}^{-1}U_{r}^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\] is the least-squares approximate solution, and use this expression to find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\).\nThis activity demonstrates the power of a singular value decomposition to find a least-squares approximate solution for an equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\). Because it immediately provides an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), something that we've had to construct using the Gram-Schmidt process in the past, we can easily project \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), which results in a simple expression for \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\).\n**Proposition 7.5.1**_If \\(A=U_{r}\\Sigma_{r}V_{r}^{T}\\) is a reduced singular value decomposition of \\(A\\), then a least-squares approximate solution to \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is given by_\n\\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=V_{r}\\Sigma_{r}^{-1}U_{r}^{T}\\mathbf{b}.\\]\nIf the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent, then the equation \\(A\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) has only one solution so there is a unique least-squares approximate solution \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\). Otherwise, the expression in Proposition 7.5.1 produces the solution to \\(A\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) having the shortest length.\n\n\n",

In other words, \\(\\hat{x}\\) solves the problem (16.1) if it is feasible and has the smallest possible value of the objective function among all feasible vectors.\nThe constrained least squares problem combines the problems of solving a set of linear equations (find \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(Cx=d\\)) with the least squares problem\n(find \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\)). Indeed each of these problems can be considered a special case of the constrained least squares problem (16.1).\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane. The function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is defined as\n\\[\\hat{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}p(x)&x\\leq a\\\\ q(x)&x>a,\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nwith \\(a\\) given, and \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) polynomials of degree three or less,\n\\[p(x)=\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x+\\theta_{3}x^{2}+\\theta_{4}x^{3},\\qquad q(x)=\\theta _{5}+\\theta_{6}x+\\theta_{7}x^{2}+\\theta_{8}x^{3}.\\]\nWe also impose the condition that \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\), so that \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is continuous and has a continuous first derivative at \\(x=a\\). Suppose the \\(N\\) data\nFigure 16.1: Least squares fit of two cubic polynomials to 140 points, with continuity constraints \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\).\npoints \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) are numbered so that \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{M}\\leq a\\) and \\(x_{M+1},\\ldots,x_{N}>a\\). The sum of squares of the prediction errors is\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{M}(\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x_{i}+\\theta_{3}x_{i}^{2}+\\theta_{4}x_{i}^{ 3}-y_{i})^{2}+\\sum_{i=M+1}^{N}(\\theta_{5}+\\theta_{6}x_{i}+\\theta_{7}x_{i}^{2}+ \\theta_{8}x_{i}^{3}-y_{i})^{2}.\\]\nThe conditions \\(p(a)-q(a)=0\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)-q^{\\prime}(a)=0\\) are two linear equations\n\\[\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}a+\\theta_{3}a^{2}+\\theta_{4}a^{3}-\\theta_{5} -\\theta_{6}a-\\theta_{7}a^{2}-\\theta_{8}a^{3} = 0\\] \\[\\theta_{2}+2\\theta_{3}a+3\\theta_{4}a^{2}-\\theta_{6}-2\\theta_{7}a- 3\\theta_{8}a^{2} = 0.\\]\nWe can determine the coefficients \\(\\hat{\\theta}=(\\hat{\\theta}_{1},\\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_{8})\\) that minimize the sum of squares of the prediction errors, subject to the continuity constraints, by solving a constrained least squares problem\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|A\\theta-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&C\\theta=d.\\end{array}\\]\nThe matrices and vectors \\(A\\), \\(b\\), \\(C\\), \\(d\\) are defined as\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccc}1&x_{1}&x_{1}^{2}&x_{1}^{3}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 1&x_{2}&x_{2}^{2}&x_{2}^{3}&0&0&0&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 1&x_{M}&x_{M}^{2}&x_{M}^{3}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&x_{M+1}&x_{M+1}^{2}&x_{M+1}^{3}\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&x_{M+2}&x_{M+2}^{2}&x_{M+2}^{3}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&x_{N}&x_{N}^{2}&x_{N}^{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad b=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}y_{1}\\\\ y_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{M}\\\\ y_{M+1}\\\\ y_{M+2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{N}\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nand\n\\[C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccc}1&a&a^{2}&a^{3}&-1&-a&-a^{2}&-a^{3}\\\\ 0&1&2a&3a^{2}&0&-1&-2a&-3a^{2}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad d=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis method is easily extended to piecewise-polynomial functions with more than two intervals.

How do the left singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\) provide an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n* Remember that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) is the dimension of the column space. What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) and how do the number of nonzero singular values determine \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\)?\nThis activity shows how a singular value decomposition of a matrix encodes important information about its null and column spaces. More specifically, the left and right singular vectors provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This is one of the reasons that singular value decompositions are so useful.\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{r}&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nThe first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\):\n\\[U=\\left[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{r}}_{\\operatorname{Col}(A)} \\ \\mathbf{u}_{r+1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{m}\\right]\\]\nand the last \\(n-r\\) columns of \\(V\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\):\n\\[V=\\left[\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{r}\\ \\underbrace{\\mathbf{v}_{r+1} \\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{n}}_{\\operatorname{Nul}(A)}\\right]\\]\nRemember that Proposition 7.4.6 says that \\(A\\) and its transpose \\(A^{T}\\) share the same singular values. Since the rank of a matrix equals its number of nonzero singular values, this means that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T})\\), a fact that we cited back in Section 6.2.\n**Proposition 7.4.8**: _For any matrix \\(A\\),_\n\\[\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T}).\\]\nIf we have a singular value decomposition of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\), Proposition 7.4.6 also tells us that the left singular vectors of \\(A\\) are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). Therefore, \\(U\\) is the \\(m\\times m\\) matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). This means that the last \\(m-r\\) vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\). Therefore, the columns of \\(U\\) provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\):\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nEvaluating the following cell will create the matrices \\(\\mathsf{U},\\mathsf{V}\\), and Sigma. Notice how the diagonal_matrix command provides a convenient way to form the diagonal matrix \\(\\Sigma\\).\nh = 1/2 U = matrix(4,4,[h,h,h,h, h,h,-h,-h, h,-h,h,-h, h,-h,-h,h]) V = matrix(4,4,[h,h,h,h, h,-h,-h,h,-h,h,h,-h,h,-h,h]) Sigma = diagonal_matrix([500, 100, 20, 4])\n1. Form the matrix \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\). What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\)?\n2. Now form the approximating matrix \\(A_{1}=U\\Sigma^{(1)}V^{T}\\). What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A_{1})\\)?\n3. Find the error in the approximation \\(A\\approx A_{1}\\) by finding \\(A-A_{1}\\).\n4. Now find \\(A_{2}=U\\Sigma^{(2)}V^{T}\\) and the error \\(A-A_{2}\\). What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A_{2})\\)?\n5. Find \\(A_{3}=U\\Sigma^{(3)}V^{T}\\) and the error \\(A-A_{3}\\). What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A_{3})\\)?\n6. What would happen if we were to compute \\(A_{4}\\)?\n7. What do you notice about the error \\(A-A_{k}\\) as \\(k\\) increases?\nIn this activity, the approximating matrix \\(A_{k}\\) has rank \\(k\\) because its singular value decomposition has \\(k\\) nonzero singular values. We then saw how the difference between \\(A\\) and the approximations \\(A_{k}\\) decreases as \\(k\\) increases, which means that the sequence \\(A_{k}\\) forms better approximations as \\(k\\) increases.\nAnother way to represent \\(A_{k}\\) is with a reduced singular value decomposition so that \\(A_{k}=U_{k}\\Sigma_{k}V_{k}^{T}\\) where\n\\[U_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{u}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\\Sigma_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{k}\\end{bmatrix},\\quad V_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1 }&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nNotice that the rank \\(1\\) matrix \\(A_{1}\\) then has the form \\(A_{1}=\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}= \\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\) and that we can similarly write:\n\\[A\\approx A_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\]\n\\[A\\approx A_{2}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}\\] \\[A\\approx A_{3}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_ {2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}\\] \\[\\qquad\\vdots\\] \\[A=A_{r}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}+ \\ldots+\\sigma_{r}\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\mathbf{v}_{r}^{T}.\\]\nGiven two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the matrix \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)\\(\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\) is called the _outer product_ of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). (The dot product \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{u}^{T}\\mathbf{v}\\) is sometimes called the _inner product_.) An outer product will always be a rank 1 matrix so we see above how \\(A_{k}\\) is obtained by adding together \\(k\\) rank \\(1\\) matrices, each of which gets us one step closer to the original matrix \\(A\\).\n#### Principal component analysis\nIn Section 7.3, we explored principal component analysis as a technique to reduce the dimension of a dataset. In particular, we constructed the covariance matrix \\(C\\) from a demeaned data matrix and saw that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(C\\) tell us about the variance of the dataset in different directions. We referred to the eigenvectors of \\(C\\) as _principal components_ and found that projecting the data onto a subspace defined by the first few principal components frequently gave us a way to visualize the dataset. As we added more principal components, we retained more information about the original dataset. This feels similar to the rank \\(k\\) approximations we have just seen so let's explore the connection.\nSuppose that we have a dataset with \\(N\\) points, that \\(A\\) represents the demeaned data matrix, that \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) is a singular value decomposition, and that the singular values are \\(A\\) are denoted as \\(\\sigma_{i}\\). It follows that the covariance matrix\n\\[C=\\frac{1}{N}AA^{T}=\\frac{1}{N}(U\\Sigma V^{T})(U\\Sigma V^{T})^{T}=U\\left(\\frac {1}{N}\\Sigma\\Sigma^{T}\\right)U^{T}.\\]\nNotice that \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\Sigma\\Sigma^{T}\\) is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\sigma_{i}^{2}\\). Therefore, it follows that\n\\[C=U\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\Sigma\\Sigma^{T}\\right)U^{T}\\]\nis an orthogonal diagonalization of \\(C\\) showing that\n* the principal components of the dataset, which are the eigenvectors of \\(C\\), are given by the columns of \\(U\\). In other words, the left singular vectors of \\(A\\) are the principal components of the dataset.\n\n\n",

In this exercise, we will consider \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices as defining matrix transformations. 1. Write the matrix \\(A\\) that performs a \\(45^{\\circ}\\) rotation. What geometric operation undoes this rotation? Find the matrix that perform this operation and verify that it is \\(A^{-1}\\). 2. Write the matrix \\(A\\) that performs a \\(180^{\\circ}\\) rotation. Verify that \\(A^{2}=I\\) so that \\(A^{-1}=A\\), and explain geometrically why this is the case. 3. Find three more matrices \\(A\\) that satisfy \\(A^{2}=I\\).\nInverses for certain types of matrices can be found in a relatively straightforward fashion.\n1. The matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}2&0&0\\\\ 0&-1&0\\\\ 0&0&-4\\end{bmatrix}\\) is called _diagonal_ since the only nonzero entries are on the diagonal of the matrix. 1. Find \\(D^{-1}\\) by augmenting \\(D\\) by the identity and finding its reduced row echelon form. 2. Under what conditions is a diagonal matrix invertible? 3. Explain why the inverse of a diagonal matrix is also diagonal and explain the relationship between the diagonal entries in \\(D\\) and \\(D^{-1}\\). 2. Consider the lower triangular matrix \\(L=\\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\\\ -2&1&0\\\\ 3&-4&1\\end{bmatrix}\\). 1. Find \\(L^{-1}\\) by augmenting \\(L\\) by the identity and finding its reduced row echelon form. 2. Explain why the inverse of a lower triangular matrix is also lower triangular.\n4. Our definition of an invertible matrix requires that \\(A\\) be a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. Let's examine what happens when \\(A\\) is not square. For instance, suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-1&-1\\\\ -2&-1\\\\ 3&0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-2&2&1\\\\ 1&-2&-1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n2. Verify that \\(BA=I_{2}\\). In this case, we say that \\(B\\) is a _left_ inverse of \\(A\\).\n5. If \\(A\\) has a left inverse \\(B\\), we can still use it to find solutions to linear equations. If we know there is a solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\(B\\) to find \\(\\mathbf{x}=B\\mathbf{b}\\). Suppose you know there is a solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-1\\\\ -3\\\\ 6\\end{array}\\right]\\). Use the left inverse \\(B\\) to find \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and verify that it is a solution.\n6. Now consider the matrix \\[C=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1&-1&0\\\\ -2&1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\] and verify that \\(C\\) is also a left inverse of \\(A\\). This shows that the matrix \\(A\\) may have more than one left inverse.\n7. If a matrix \\(A\\) is invertible, there is a sequence of row operations that transforms \\(A\\) into the identity matrix \\(I\\). We have seen that every row operation can be performed by matrix multiplication. If the \\(j^{th}\\) step in the Gaussian elimination process is performed\nby multiplying by , then we have , which means that . For each of the following matrices, find a sequence of row operations that transforms the matrix to the identity . Write the matrices that perform the steps and use them to find . .\n3. Suppose that \\(A\\) is an invertible matrix and that \\(AB=AC\\). Can you conclude that \\(B=C\\)? 4. Suppose that \\(A\\) is an invertible \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. What can you say about the span of the columns of \\(A^{-1}\\)? 5. Suppose that \\(A\\) is an invertible matrix and that \\(B\\) is row equivalent to \\(A\\). Can you guarantee that \\(B\\) is invertible?\n\n\n",

What is |A|?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIn the basic least squares problem, we seek \\(x\\) that minimizes the objective function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\). We now add _constraints_ to this problem, by insisting that \\(x\\) satisfy the linear equations \\(Cx=d\\), where the matrix \\(C\\) and the vector \\(d\\) are given. The _linearly constrained least squares problem_ (or just constrained least squares problem) is written as\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&Cx=d.\\end{array}\\] (16.1)\nHere \\(x\\), the variable to be found, is an \\(n\\)-vector. The problem data (which are given) are the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\), the \\(p\\times n\\) matrix \\(C\\), and the \\(p\\)-vector \\(d\\).\nWe refer to the function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) as the _objective_ of the problem, and the set of \\(p\\) linear equality constraints \\(Cx=d\\) as the _constraints_ of the problem. They can be written out as \\(p\\) scalar constraints (equations)\n\\[c_{i}^{T}x=d_{i},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,p,\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i}^{T}\\) is the \\(i\\)th row of \\(C\\).\nAn \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is called _feasible_ (for the problem (16.1)) if it satisfies the constraints, _i.e._, \\(Cx=d\\). An \\(n\\)-vector \\(\\hat{x}\\) is called an _optimal point_ or _solution_ of the optimization problem (16.1) if it is feasible, and if \\(\\|A\\hat{x}-b\\|^{2}\\leq\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) holds for any feasible \\(x\\). In other words, \\(\\hat{x}\\) solves the problem (16.1) if it is feasible and has the smallest possible value of the objective function among all feasible vectors.\nThe constrained least squares problem combines the problems of solving a set of linear equations (find \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(Cx=d\\)) with the least squares problem\n(find \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\)). Indeed each of these problems can be considered a special case of the constrained least squares problem (16.1).\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane.

This is illustrated in figure 11.1, which shows the two cubic polynomials that interpolate the two sets of points shown as filled circles and squares, respectively.\nThe columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are interesting: They give the coefficients of a polynomial that evaluates to 0 at three of the points, and 1 at the other\nfirst column of \\(A^{-1}\\), which is \\(A^{-1}e_{1}\\), gives the coefficients of the polynomial that has value 1 at \\(-1.1\\), and value 0 at \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, and 0.8. The four polynomials with coefficients given by the columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are called the _Lagrange polynomials_ associated with the points \\(-1.1\\), \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, 0.8. These are plotted in figure 11.2. (The Lagrange polynomials are named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, whose name will re-appear in several other contexts.)\nThe rows of \\(A^{-1}\\) are also interesting: The \\(i\\)th row shows how the values \\(b_{1}\\), ..., \\(b_{4}\\), the polynomial values at the points \\(-1.1\\), \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, 0.8, map into the \\(i\\)th coefficient of the polynomial, \\(c_{i}\\). For example, we see that the coefficient \\(c_{4}\\) is not very sensitive to the value of \\(b_{1}\\) (since \\((A^{-1})_{41}\\) is small). We can also see that for each increase of one in \\(b_{4}\\), the coefficient \\(c_{2}\\) increases by around 0.95.\nBalancing chemical reactions.(See page 154 for background.)

A similar notation is \\(a/2\\), where \\(a\\) is a vector, meaning \\((1/2)a\\). The scalar-vector product \\((-1)a\\) is written simply as \\(-a\\). Note that \\(0\\,a=0\\) (where the left-hand zero is the scalar zero, and the right-hand zero is a vector zero of the same size as \\(a\\)).\nProperties.By definition, we have \\(\\alpha a=a\\alpha\\), for any scalar \\(\\alpha\\) and any vector \\(a\\). This is called the _commutative property_ of scalar-vector multiplication; it means that scalar-vector multiplication can be written in either order.\nFigure 1.9: Average monthly rainfall in inches measured in downtown Los Angeles and San Francisco International Airport, and their sum. Averages are 30-year averages (1981–2010).\nScalar multiplication obeys several other laws that are easy to figure out from the definition. For example, it satisfies the associative property: If \\(a\\) is a vector and \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, we have\n\\[(\\beta\\gamma)a=\\beta(\\gamma a).\\]\nOn the left-hand side we see scalar-scalar multiplication (\\(\\beta\\gamma\\)) and scalar-vector multiplication; on the right-hand side we see two scalar-vector products. As a consequence, we can write the vector above as \\(\\beta\\gamma a\\), since it does not matter whether we interpret this as \\(\\beta(\\gamma a)\\) or \\((\\beta\\gamma)a\\).\nThe associative property holds also when we denote scalar-vector multiplication with the scalar on the right. For example, we have \\(\\beta(\\gamma a)=(\\beta a)\\gamma\\), and consequently we can write both as \\(\\beta a\\gamma\\). As a convention, however, this vector is normally written as \\(\\beta\\gamma a\\) or as \\((\\beta\\gamma)a\\).\nIf \\(a\\) is a vector and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, then\n\\[(\\beta+\\gamma)a=\\beta a+\\gamma a.\\]\n(This is the left-distributive property of scalar-vector multiplication.) Scalar multiplication, like ordinary multiplication, has higher precedence in equations than vector addition, so the right-hand side here, \\(\\beta a+\\gamma a\\), means \\((\\beta a)+(\\gamma a)\\). It is useful to identify the symbols appearing in this formula above. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right denotes vector addition. When scalar multiplication is written with the scalar on the right, we have the right-distributive property:\n\\[a(\\beta+\\gamma)=a\\beta+a\\gamma.\\]\nScalar-vector multiplication also satisfies another version of the right-distributive property:\n\\[\\beta(a+b)=\\beta a+\\beta b\\]\nfor any scalar \\(\\beta\\) and any \\(n\\)-vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this equation, both of the \\(+\\) symbols refer to the addition of \\(n\\)-vectors.\nExamples.\n* _Displacements._ When a vector \\(a\\) represents a displacement, and \\(\\beta>0\\), \\(\\beta a\\) is a displacement in the same direction of \\(a\\), with its magnitude scaled by \\(\\beta\\). When \\(\\beta<0\\), \\(\\beta a\\) represents a displacement in the opposite direction of \\(a\\), with magnitude scaled by \\(|\\beta|\\). This is illustrated in figure 1.10.\n* _Materials requirements._ Suppose the \\(n\\)-vector \\(q\\) is the bill of materials for producing one unit of some product, _i.e._, \\(q_{i}\\) is the amount of raw material required to produce one unit of product. To produce \\(\\alpha\\) units of the product will then require raw materials given by \\(\\alpha q\\). (Here we assume that \\(\\alpha\\geq 0\\).)\n* _Audio scaling._ If \\(a\\) is a vector representing an audio signal, the scalar-vector product \\(\\beta a\\) is perceived as the same audio signal, but changed in volume (loudness) by the factor \\(|\\beta|\\). For example, when \\(\\beta=1/2\\) (or \\(\\beta=-1/2\\)), \\(\\beta a\\) is perceived as the same audio signal, but quieter.\nLinear combinations.If \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{m}\\) are \\(n\\)-vectors, and \\(\\beta_{1},\\ldots,\\beta_{m}\\) are scalars, the \\(n\\)-vector\n\\[\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{m}a_{m}\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nProperties of matrix addition.The following important properties of matrix addition can be verified directly from the definition. We assume here that \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are matrices of the same size.\n* _Commutativity._\\(A+B=B+A\\)_._\n* _Associativity._\\((A+B)+C=A+(B+C)\\). We therefore write both as \\(A+B+C\\).\n* _Addition with zero matrix._\\(A+0=0+A=A\\). Adding the zero matrix to a matrix has no effect.\n* _Transpose of sum._\\((A+B)^{T}=A^{T}+B^{T}\\). The transpose of a sum of two matrices is the sum of their transposes.\n#### Scalar-matrix multiplication\nScalar multiplication of matrices is defined in a similar way as for vectors, and is done by multiplying every element of the matrix by the scalar. For example\n\\[(-2)\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&6\\\\ 9&3\\\\ 6&0\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-2&-12\\\\ -18&-6\\\\ -12&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nAs with scalar-vector multiplication, the scalar can also appear on the right. Note that \\(0\\,A=0\\) (where the left-hand zero is the scalar zero, and the right-hand \\(0\\) is the zero matrix).\nSeveral useful properties of scalar multiplication follow directly from the definition. For example, \\((\\beta A)^{T}=\\beta(A^{T})\\) for a scalar \\(\\beta\\) and a matrix \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) is a matrix and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, then\n\\[(\\beta+\\gamma)A=\\beta A+\\gamma A,\\qquad(\\beta\\gamma)A=\\beta(\\gamma A).\\]\nIt is useful to identify the symbols appearing in these two equations. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left of the left-hand equation is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right of the left-hand equation denotes matrix addition. On the left side of the right-hand equation we see scalar-scalar multiplication (\\(\\alpha\\beta\\)) and scalar-matrix multiplication; on the right we see two cases of scalar-matrix multiplication.\nFinally, we mention that scalar-matrix multiplication has higher precedence than matrix addition, which means that we should carry out multiplication before addition (when there are no parentheses to fix the order). So the right-hand side of the left equation above is to be interpreted as \\((\\beta A)+(\\gamma A)\\).\n#### Matrix norm\nThe norm of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), denoted \\(\\|A\\|\\), is the squareroot of the sum of the squares of its entries,\n\\[\\|A\\|=\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{ij}^{2}}.\\] (6.3)\nThis agrees with our definition for vectors when \\(A\\) is a vector, _i.e._, \\(n=1\\). The norm of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix is the norm of an \\(mn\\)-vector formed from the entries of the matrix (in any order). Like the vector norm, the matrix norm is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of a matrix. In some applications it is more natural to use the RMS values of the matrix entries, \\(\\|A\\|/\\sqrt{mn}\\), as a measure of matrix size. The RMS value of the matrix entries tells us the typical size of the entries, independent of the matrix dimensions.\nThe matrix norm (6.3) satisfies the properties of any norm, given on page 46. For any \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we have \\(\\|A\\|\\geq 0\\) (_i.e._, the norm is nonnegative), and \\(\\|A\\|=0\\) only if \\(A=0\\) (definiteness). The matrix norm is nonnegative homogeneous: For any scalar \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we have \\(\\|\\gamma A\\|=|\\gamma|\\|A\\|\\). Finally, for any two \\(m\\times n\\) matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we have the triangle inequality,\n\\[\\|A+B\\|\\leq\\|A\\|+\\|B\\|.\\]\n(The plus symbol on the left-hand side is matrix addition, and the plus symbol on the right-hand side is addition of numbers.)\n\n\n",

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\n\n",

Compute $(x_1/(x_2 + 1))^2 + (x_2 / (x_1 + 1))^2$.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow suppose that \\(x\\) is any \\(n\\)-vector. It can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\):\n\\[x=\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{n}a_{n}.\\]\nThe dual basis gives us a simple way to find the coefficients \\(\\beta_{1},\\ldots,\\beta_{n}\\).\nWe start with \\(AB=I\\), and multiply by \\(x\\) to get\n\\[x=ABx=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}a_{1}&\\cdots&a_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}b_{1}^{T}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ b_{n}^{T}\\end{array}\\right]x=(b_{1}^{T}x)a_{1}+\\cdots+(b_{n}^{T}x)a_{n}.\\]\nThis means (since the vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) are linearly independent) that \\(\\beta_{i}=b_{i}^{T}x\\). In words: The coefficients in the expansion of a vector in a basis are given by the inner products with the dual basis vectors. Using matrix notation, we can say that \\(\\beta=B^{T}x=(A^{-1})^{T}x\\) is the vector of coefficients of \\(x\\) in the basis given by the columns of \\(A\\).\nAs a simple numerical example, consider the basis\n\\[a_{1}=(1,1),\\qquad a_{2}=(1,-1).\\]\nThe dual basis consists of the rows of \\([\\begin{array}{cc}a_{1}&a_{2}\\end{array}]^{-1}\\), which are\n\\[b_{1}^{T}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/2&1/2\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad b_{2}^{T }=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/2&-1/2\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTo express the vector \\(x=(-5,1)\\) as a linear combination of \\(a_{1}\\) and \\(a_{2}\\), we have\n\\[x=(b_{1}^{T}x)a_{1}+(b_{2}^{T}x)a_{2}=(-2)a_{1}+(-3)a_{2},\\]\nwhich can be directly verified.\nNegative matrix powers.We can now give a meaning to matrix powers with negative integer exponents. Suppose \\(A\\) is a square invertible matrix and \\(k\\) is a positive integer. Then by repeatedly applying property (11.2), we get\n\\[(A^{k})^{-1}=(A^{-1})^{k}.\\]\nWe denote this matrix as \\(A^{-k}\\). For example, if \\(A\\) is square and invertible, then \\(A^{-2}=A^{-1}A^{-1}=(AA)^{-1}\\). With \\(A^{0}\\) defined as \\(A^{0}=I\\), the identity \\(A^{k+l}=A^{k}A^{l}\\) holds for all integers \\(k\\) and \\(l\\).\nTriangular matrix.A triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. We first discuss this for a lower triangular matrix. Let \\(L\\) be \\(n\\times n\\) and lower triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. We show that the columns are linearly independent, _i.e._, \\(Lx=0\\) is only possible if \\(x=0\\). Expanding the matrix-vector product, we can write \\(Lx=0\\) as\n\\[L_{11}x_{1} = 0\\] \\[L_{21}x_{1}+L_{22}x_{2} = 0\\] \\[L_{31}x_{1}+L_{32}x_{2}+L_{33}x_{3} = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[L_{n1}x_{1}+L_{n2}x_{2}+\\cdots+L_{n,n-1}x_{n-1}+L_{nn}x_{n} = 0.\\]\nSince \\(L_{11}\\neq 0\\), the first equation implies \\(x_{1}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=0\\), the second equation reduces to \\(L_{22}x_{2}=0\\). Since \\(L_{22}\\neq 0\\), we conclude that \\(x_{2}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=x_{2}=0\\), the third equation now reduces to \\(L_{33}x_{3}=0\\), and since \\(L_{33}\\) is assumed to be nonzero, we have \\(x_{3}=0\\). Continuing this argument, we find that all entries of \\(x\\) are zero, and this shows that the columns of \\(L\\) are linearly independent. It follows that \\(L\\) is invertible.\nA similar argument can be followed to show that an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. One can also simply note that if \\(R\\) is upper triangular, then \\(L=R^{T}\\) is lower triangular with the same diagonal, and use the formula \\((L^{T})^{-1}=(L^{-1})^{T}\\) for the inverse of the transpose.\nInverse via QR factorization.The QR factorization gives a simple expression for the inverse of an invertible matrix. If \\(A\\) is square and invertible, its columns are linearly independent, so it has a QR factorization \\(A=QR\\). The matrix \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. Hence \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are invertible, and the formula for the inverse product gives\n\\[A^{-1}=(QR)^{-1}=R^{-1}Q^{-1}=R^{-1}Q^{T}.\\] (11.3)\nIn the following section we give an algorithm for computing \\(R^{-1}\\), or more directly, the product \\(R^{-1}Q^{T}\\). This gives us a method to compute the matrix inverse.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\nThe number of times that \\(\\lambda_{j}-\\lambda\\) appears as a factor in the characteristic polynomial, is called the _multiplicity_ of the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{j}\\).\n**Example 4.2.7** We have seen that the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}&1&1\\\\ -1&3\\end{array}\\right]\\) has the characteristic equation \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\). This matrix has a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=2\\), which has multiplicity \\(2\\).\n**Example 4.2.8** If a matrix has the characteristic equation\n\\[(4-\\lambda)^{2}(-5-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)^{7}(3-\\lambda)^{2}=0,\\]\nthen that matrix has four eigenvalues: \\(\\lambda=4\\) having multiplicity \\(2\\); \\(\\lambda=-5\\) having multiplicity \\(1\\); \\(\\lambda=1\\) having multiplicity \\(7\\); and \\(\\lambda=3\\) having multiplicity \\(2\\). The degree of the characteristic polynomial is the sum of the multiplicities \\(2+1+7+2=12\\) so this matrix must be a \\(12\\times 12\\) matrix.\nThe multiplicities of the eigenvalues are important because they influence the dimension of the eigenspaces. We know that the dimension of an eigenspace must be at least one; the following proposition also tells us the dimension of an eigenspace can be no larger than the multiplicity of its associated eigenvalue.\n\n\n",

We found that with\n* one pivot position, the span was a line.\n* two pivot positions, the span was a plane.\n* three pivot positions, the span was \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\nThough we will return to these ideas later, for now take note of the fact that the span of a set of vectors in \\(\\mathbf{R}^{3}\\) is a relatively simple, familiar geometric object.\nThe reasoning that led us to conclude that the span of a set of vectors is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) when the associated matrix has a pivot position in every row applies more generally.\n**Proposition 2.3.14**: _Suppose we have vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). Then \\(\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\}=\\mathbf{ R}^{m}\\) if and only if the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\cdots&\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\) has a pivot position in every row._\nThis tells us something important about the number of vectors needed to span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). Suppose we have \\(n\\) vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) that span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). The proposition tells us that the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_ {n}\\end{array}\\right]\\) has a pivot position in every row, such as in this reduced row echelon matrix.\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc}1&0&*&0&*&0\\\\ 0&1&*&0&*&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1&*&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSince a matrix can have at most one pivot position in a column, there must be at least as many columns as there are rows, which implies that \\(n\\geq m\\). For instance, if we have a set of vectors that span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{632}\\), there must be at least 632 vectors in the set.\n**Proposition 2.3.15**_A set of vectors whose span is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) contains at least \\(m\\) vectors._\nWe have thought about a linear combination of a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) as the result of walking a certain distance in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), followed by walking a certain distance in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and so on. If \\(\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\}=\\mathbb{ R}^{m}\\), this means that we can walk to every point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) using the directions \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\). Intuitively, this proposition is telling us that we need at least \\(m\\) directions to have the flexibility needed to reach every point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\n**Terminology.**\nBecause span is a concept that is connected to a set of vectors, we say, \"The span of the set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) is ...\" While it may be tempting to say, \"The span of the matrix \\(A\\) is ...,\" we should instead say \"The span of the columns of the matrix \\(A\\) is ...\"\n#### Summary\nWe defined the span of a set of vectors and developed some intuition for this concept through a series of examples.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Activity 6.4.5.** As before, we would like to use Sage to automate the process of finding and using the \\(QR\\) factorization of a matrix \\(A\\).

For this reason, we have provided our own version of the factorization.\n#### Summary\nThis section explored the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm and how it leads to the matrix factorization \\(A=QR\\) when the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent.\n* Beginning with a basis \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) for a subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), the vectors \\[\\mathbf{w}_{1}=\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\]\n#### 6.4.2.1 The \\(Q\\)-form\nThe \\(Q\\)-form is a \\(Q\\)-form.

What can you say about \\(\\mathrm{Null}(A)\\)?\n**Example 3.5.11**: Consider the matrix \\(A\\) along with its reduced row echelon form:\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}2&0&-4&-6&0\\\\ -4&-1&7&11&2\\\\ 0&-1&-1&-1&2\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1&0&-2&-3&0\\\\ 0&1&1&1&-2\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTo find a parametric description of the solution space to \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), imagine that we augment both \\(A\\) and its reduced row echelon form by a column of zeroes, which leads to the equations\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}x_{1}&-2x_{3}-3x_{4}&=&0\\\\ x_{2}+&x_{3}+&x_{4}-2x_{5}=0.\\end{array}\\]\nNotice that \\(x_{3}\\), \\(x_{4}\\), and \\(x_{5}\\) are free variables so we rewrite these equations as\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}x_{1}=2x_{3}+3x_{4}\\\\ x_{2}=&-x_{3}-x_{4}+2x_{5}.\\end{array}\\]\nIn vector form, we have\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ x_{3}\\\\ x_{4}\\\\ x_{5}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2x_{3}+3x_{4}\\\\ -x_{3}-x_{4}+2x_{5}\\\\ x_{3}\\\\ x_{4}\\\\ x_{5}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\\[=x_{3}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]+x_{4}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]+x_{5}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 2\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis expression says that any vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) satisfying \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) is a linear combination of the vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 2\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIt is straightforward to check that these vectors are linearly independent, which means that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) form a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\), a 3-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{5}\\).\nAs illustrated in this example, the dimension of \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is equal to the number of free variables in the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), which equals the number of columns of \\(A\\) without pivot positions or the number of columns of \\(A\\) minus the number of pivot positions.\n**Proposition 3.5.12**: _If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, then \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) whose dimension is_\n\\[\\dim\\,\\,\\mathrm{Nul}(A)=n-\\mathrm{rank}(A).\\]\nCombining Proposition 3.5.9 and Proposition 3.5.12 shows that\n**Proposition 3.5.13**: _If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, then_\n\\[\\dim\\,\\,Col(A)+\\dim\\,\\,\\mathrm{Nul}(A)=n.\\]\n#### Summary\nOnce again, we find ourselves revisiting our two fundamental questions concerning the existence and uniqueness of solutions to linear systems. The column space \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) contains all the vectors \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) for which the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent. The null space \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is the solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), which reflects on the uniqueness of solutions to this and other equations.\n* A subspace \\(S\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) that can be represented as the span of a set of\nvectors. A basis of \\(S\\) is a linearly independent set of vectors whose span is \\(S\\).\n* If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, the column space \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is the span of the columns of \\(A\\) and forms a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\n* A basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is found from the columns of \\(A\\) that have pivot positions. The dimension is therefore \\(\\dim\\ \\operatorname{Col}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\).\n* The null space \\(\\operatorname{Null}(A)\\) is the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) and is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\).\n* A basis for \\(\\operatorname{Null}(A)\\) is found through a parametric description of the solution space of \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), and we have that \\(\\dim\\ \\operatorname{Null}(A)=n-\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAnd finally, \\(A\\mathbf{x}=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_ {2}&\\mathbf{u}_{3}&\\mathbf{u}_{4}\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}20c_{1}\\\\ 5c_{2}\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}=20c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+5c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\).\nTo summarize, we have \\(A\\mathbf{x}=20c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+5c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\).\nWhat condition on \\(c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\), and \\(c_{3}\\) must be satisfied if \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=40\\mathbf{u}_{1}+20\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\)? Is there a unique solution or infinitely many?\n* Remembering that \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) are linearly independent, what condition on \\(c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\), and \\(c_{3}\\) must be satisfied if \\(A\\mathbf{x}=0\\)?\n* How do the right singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\) provide a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Null}(A)\\), the subspace of solutions to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=0\\)?\n* Remember that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) if the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent, which means that \\[A\\mathbf{x}=20c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+5c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\mathbf{b}\\] for some coefficients \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\). How do the left singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\) provide an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n* Remember that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) is the dimension of the column space. What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) and how do the number of nonzero singular values determine \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\)?\nThis activity shows how a singular value decomposition of a matrix encodes important information about its null and column spaces. More specifically, the left and right singular vectors provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This is one of the reasons that singular value decompositions are so useful.\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{r}&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nThe first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\):\n\\[U=\\left[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{r}}_{\\operatorname{Col}(A)} \\ \\mathbf{u}_{r+1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{m}\\right]\\]\nand the last \\(n-r\\) columns of \\(V\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\):\n\\[V=\\left[\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{r}\\ \\underbrace{\\mathbf{v}_{r+1} \\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{n}}_{\\operatorname{Nul}(A)}\\right]\\]\nRemember that Proposition 7.4.6 says that \\(A\\) and its transpose \\(A^{T}\\) share the same singular values. Since the rank of a matrix equals its number of nonzero singular values, this means that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T})\\), a fact that we cited back in Section 6.2.\n**Proposition 7.4.8**: _For any matrix \\(A\\),_\n\\[\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T}).\\]\nIf we have a singular value decomposition of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\), Proposition 7.4.6 also tells us that the left singular vectors of \\(A\\) are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). Therefore, \\(U\\) is the \\(m\\times m\\) matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). This means that the last \\(m-r\\) vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\). Therefore, the columns of \\(U\\) provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\):\n\n\n",

Recall that we may multiply any nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) by a scalar so that the new vector has length \\(1\\). For instance, we know that if \\(s\\) is a positive scalar, then \\(|s\\mathbf{w}|=s\\,|\\mathbf{w}|\\). To obtain a vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) having unit length, we want\n\\[|\\mathbf{u}|=|s\\mathbf{w}|=s\\,|\\mathbf{w}|=1\\]\nso that \\(s=1/|\\mathbf{w}|\\). Therefore,\n\\[\\mathbf{u}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{w}|}\\mathbf{w}\\]\nbecomes a unit vector parallel to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\nOrthogonal sets in which the vectors have unit length are called _orthonormal_ and are especially convenient.\n**Definition 6.3.6** An _orthonormal_ set is an orthogonal set of vectors each of which has unit length.\n**Example 6.3.7** The vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{array}\\right],\\hskip 28.452756pt\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}-1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nare an orthonormal set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) and form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\).\nIf we form the matrix\n\\[Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}1/ \\sqrt{2}&-1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nwe find that \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\) since Proposition 6.2.8 tells us that\n\\[Q^{T}Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\\\ \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThe previous activity and example illustrate the next proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.8**_If the columns of the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal set, then \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix._\n#### Orthogonal projections\nWe now turn to an important problem that will appear in many forms in the rest of our explorations. Suppose, as shown in Figure 6.3.9, that we have a subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that is not in that subspace. We would like to find the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) in \\(W\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), meaning the distance between \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is as small as possible.\n**Figure 6.3.9** Given a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) not in the plane, we wish to find the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) in the plane that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\nTo get started, let's consider a simpler problem where we have a line \\(L\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), defined by the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), and another vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that is not on the line, as shown on the left of Figure 6.3.10. We wish to find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), the vector on the line that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), as illustrated in the right of Figure 6.3.10.\n**Figure 6.3.10** Given a line \\(L\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), we seek the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) on \\(L\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\nTo find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), we require that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) be orthogonal to \\(L\\). For instance, if \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is another vector on the line, as shown in Figure 6.3.11, then the Pythagorean theorem implies that\n\\[|\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{y}|^{2}=|\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}|^{2}+|\\widehat{ \\mathbf{b}}-\\mathbf{y}|^{2}\\]\nwhich means that \\(|\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{y}|\\geq|\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}|\\). Therefore, \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is closer to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) than any other vector on the line \\(L\\).\n**Definition 6.3.12** Given a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and a subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), the _orthogonal projection_ of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) in \\(W\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). It is characterized by the property that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is orthogonal to \\(W\\).\n**Activity 6.3.3.** This activity demonstrates how to determine the orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\nLet's begin by considering a line \\(L\\), defined by the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\), and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right]\\) not on \\(L\\), as illustrated in Figure 6.3.13.\n**Figure 6.3.13** Finding the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto the line defined by \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\n1. To find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), first notice that \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=s\\mathbf{w}\\) for some scalar \\(s\\). Since \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\mathbf{b}-s\\mathbf{w}\\) is\northogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), what do we know about the dot product \\[(\\mathbf{b}-s\\mathbf{w})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}?\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* \\(A\\) **is not invertible if and only if*\n* \\(\\lambda=0\\) **is an eigenvalue.*\n* \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) **is an eigenvector of*\n* \\(A\\) **having associated eigenvalue*\n* \\(\\lambda\\)**, explain why*\n* \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) **is also an eigenvector of*\n* \\(A^{2}\\) **with associated eigenvalue*\n* \\(A\\) **is invertible and*\n* \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) **is eigenvector of*\n* \\(A\\) **having associated eigenvalue*\n* \\(\\lambda\\)**, explain why*\n* \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) **is also an eigenvector of*\n* \\(A^{-1}\\) **with associated eigenvalue*\n* **The matrix*\n* \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\) **has eigenvectors*\n* \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) **and*\n* \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) **and associated eigenvalues*\n* \\(\\lambda_{1}=3\\) **and*\n* \\(\\lambda=-1\\)**.

Here is another problem with approximate computer arithmetic that we will encounter in the next section. Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}0.2&0.2&0.4\\\\ 0.2&0.3&0.1\\\\ 0.6&0.5&0.5\\end{array}\\right].\\] 1. Notice that this is a positive stochastic matrix. What do we know about the eigenvalues of this matrix? 2. Use Sage to define the matrix \\(A\\) using decimals such as 0.2 and the \\(3\\times 3\\) identity matrix \\(I\\). Ask Sage to compute \\(B=A-I\\) and find the reduced row echelon form of \\(B\\). 3. Why is the computation that Sage performed incorrect?\n* Explain why using a computer to find the eigenvectors of a matrix \\(A\\) by finding a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Null}(A-\\lambda I)\\) is problematic.\n* In practice, one rarely finds the inverse of a matrix \\(A\\). It requires considerable effort to compute, and we can solve any equation of the form \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) using an \\(LU\\) factorization, which means that the inverse isn't necessary. In any case, the best way to compute an inverse is using an \\(LU\\) factorization, as this exercise demonstrates.\n* Suppose that \\(PA=LU\\). Explain why \\(A^{-1}=U^{-1}L^{-1}P\\). Since \\(L\\) and \\(U\\) are triangular, finding their inverses is relatively efficient. That makes this an effective means of finding \\(A^{-1}\\).\n* Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}3&4&-1\\\\ 2&4&1\\\\ -3&1&4\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the \\(LU\\) factorization of \\(A\\) and use it to find \\(A^{-1}\\).\n* Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}a&a&a&a\\\\ a&b&b&b\\\\ a&b&c&c\\\\ a&b&c&d\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n* Find the \\(LU\\) factorization of \\(A\\).\n* What conditions on \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) guarantee that \\(A\\) is invertible?\n* In the \\(LU\\) factorization of a matrix, the diagonal entries of \\(L\\) are all \\(1\\) while the diagonal entries of \\(U\\) are not necessarily \\(1\\). This exercise will explore that observation by considering the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}3&1&1\\\\ -6&-4&-1\\\\ 0&-4&1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n* Perform Gaussian elimination without partial pivoting to find \\(U\\), an upper triangular matrix that is row equivalent to \\(A\\).\n* The diagonal entries of \\(U\\) are called _pivots_. Explain why \\(\\det A\\) equals the product of the pivots.\n* What is \\(\\det A\\) for our matrix \\(A\\)?\n* More generally, if we have \\(PA=LU\\), explain why \\(\\det A\\) equals plus or minus the product of the pivots.\n* Please provide a justification to your responses to these questions.\n* In this section, our hypothetical computer could only store numbers using \\(3\\) decimal places. Most computers can store numbers using \\(15\\) or more decimal places. Why do we still need to be concerned about the accuracy of our computations when solving systems of linear equations?\n2. Finding the \\(LU\\) factorization of a matrix \\(A\\) is roughly the same amount of work as finding its reduced row echelon form. Why is the \\(LU\\) factorization useful then? 3. How can we detect whether a matrix is invertible from its \\(LU\\) factorization?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\nFigure 6.3.19: A vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) along with \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the line \\(L\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement \\(L^{\\perp}\\).\n**Example 6.3.20** Consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn this case, \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) span a plane, a 2-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\). We know that \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{2}\\) and \\(QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto the plane. However, \\(Q\\) is not a square matrix so it cannot be invertible.\n**Example 6.3.21** Now consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -2/\\sqrt{6}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}&1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}&-1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}&0&-2/\\sqrt{6}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\) form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) so that both \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{3}\\) and \\(QQ^{T}=I_{3}\\). Therefore, \\(Q\\) is a square matrix and is invertible.\nMoreover, since \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), we see that \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\) so finding the inverse of \\(Q\\) is as simple as writing its transpose. Matrices with this property are very special and will play an important role in our upcoming work. We will therefore give them a special name.\n**Definition 6.3.22** A square \\(m\\times m\\) matrix \\(Q\\) whose columns form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is called _orthogonal_.\nThis terminology can be a little confusing. We call a basis orthogonal if the basis vectors are orthogonal to one another. However, a matrix is orthogonal if the columns are orthogonal to one another and have unit length. It pays to keep this in mind when reading statements about orthogonal bases and orthogonal matrices. In the meantime, we record the following proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.23**_An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is invertible and its inverse \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\)._\n#### Summary\nThis section introduced orthogonal sets and the projection formula that allows us to project vectors orthogonally onto a subspace.\n* Given an orthogonal set \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_{n}\\) that spans an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector in \\(W\\) closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and may be written as \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{1}}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{1}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{1}+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{2}}{\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{2}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\\mathbf{w}_{n} \\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{n}.\\]\n* If \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(W\\) and \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\), then the matrix \\(P=QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\).\n* If the columns of \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal basis for an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), then \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\).\n* An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is a square matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis. In this case, \\(QQ^{T}=Q^{T}Q=I\\) so that \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\).\n#### Exercises\n1.

When we begin\nour study, the populations, measured in thousands, are \\(R_{0}\\) and \\(S_{0}\\); after \\(k\\) years, the populations are \\(R_{k}\\) and \\(S_{k}\\). If we know the populations in one year, suppose that the populations in the following year are determined by the expressions \\[R_{k+1} =0.9R_{k}+0.8S_{k}\\] \\[S_{k+1} =0.2R_{k}+0.9S_{k}.\\] This is an example of a mutually beneficial relationship between two species. If species \\(S\\) is not present, then \\(R_{k+1}=0.9R_{k}\\), which means that the population of species \\(R\\) decreases every year. However, species \\(R\\) benefits from the presence of species \\(S\\), which helps \\(R\\) to grow by \\(80\\%\\) of the population of species \\(S\\). In the same way, \\(S\\) benefits from the presence of \\(R\\). We will record the populations in a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}R_{k}\\\\ S_{k}\\end{array}\\right]\\) and note that \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) where \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.9&0.8\\\\ 0.2&0.9\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n1. Verify that \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] are eigenvectors of \\(A\\) and find their respective eigenvalues.\n2. Suppose that initially \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\). Write \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n3. Write the vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\) as linear combinations of the eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n4. What happens to \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) after a very long time?\n5. When \\(k\\) becomes very large, what happens to the ratio of the populations \\(R_{k}/S_{k}\\)?\n6. After a very long time, by approximately what factor does the population of \\(R\\) grow every year? By approximately what factor does the population of \\(S\\) grow every year?\n7. If we begin instead with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right]\\), what eventually happens to the ratio \\(R_{k}/S_{k}\\) as \\(k\\) becomes very large?\nThis activity demonstrates the type of systems we will be considering. In particular, we will have vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) that describe the state of the system at time \\(k\\) and a matrix \\(A\\) that describes how the state evolves from one time to the next: \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(A\\) provide the key that helps us understand how the vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) evolve and that enables us to make long-range predictions.\nLet's look at the specific example in the previous activity more carefully. We see that\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.9&0.8\\\\ 0.2&0.9\\end{array}\\right]\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\]\nand that the matrix \\(A\\) has eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) with associated eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}=1.3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=0.5\\).\nWith initial populations \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\), we have\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{0} =2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}_{1} =1.3\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.5\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}_{2} =1.3^{2}\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.5^{2}\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}_{k} =1.3^{k}\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.5^{k}\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nLet's shift our perspective slightly. The eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) form a basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), which says that \\(A\\) is diagonalizable; that is, \\(A=PDP^{-1}\\) where\n\\[P=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\end{array}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&-2\\\\ 1&1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1.3&0\\\\ 0&0.5\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe coordinate system defined by the basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) can be used to express the state vectors. For instance, we can write the initial state vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]=2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), which means that \\(\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). Moreover, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{0}=(1.3)\\cdot 2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+(0.5)\\cdot 1\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) so that\n\\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.3\\cdot 2 \\\\ 0.5\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]=D\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]=D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}.\\]\nIn the same way,\n\\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}1.3\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}1.3^{2}\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5^{2}\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}1.3^{3}\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5^{3}\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}} =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.3^{k}\\cdot 2\\\\ 0.5^{k}\\cdot 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nMore generally, we have\n\\[\\left\\{A\\mathbf{x}\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=D\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}\\right\\}_{ \\mathcal{B}},\\]\nwhich is a restatement of the fact that \\(A\\) is similar to \\(D\\).\n\n\n",

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\n\n",

Consider the symmetric matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\). Write the quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) defined by \\(D\\) in terms of the components of \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is the value of \\(q_{D}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -4\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\)?\n2. Given the symmetric matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}2&5\\\\ 5&-3\\end{bmatrix}\\), write the quadratic form \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) de\nfined by \\(A\\) and evaluate \\(q_{A}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\).\n3. Suppose that \\(q\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=3x_{1}^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}+4x_{2}^{2}\\). Find a symmetric matrix \\(A\\) such that \\(q\\) is the quadratic form defined by \\(A\\).\n4. Suppose that \\(q\\) is a quadratic form and that \\(q(\\mathbf{x})=3\\). What is \\(q(2\\mathbf{x})\\)? \\(q(-\\mathbf{x})\\)? \\(q(10\\mathbf{x})\\)?\n5. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix and \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is the quadratic form defined by \\(A\\). Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with associated eigenvalue -4 and with length 7. What is \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\)?\nLinear algebra is principally about things that are linear. However, quadratic forms, as the name implies, have a distinctly non-linear character. First, if \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\ b&c\\end{array}\\right]\\), is a symmetric matrix, then the associated quadratic form is\n\\[q_{A}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=ax_{1}^{2}+2bx_{1}x_{2}+cx_{2}^{2}.\\]\nNotice how the variables \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) are multiplied together, which tells us this isn't a linear function.\nThis expression assumes an especially simple form when \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix. In particular, if \\(D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&0\\\\ 0&c\\end{array}\\right]\\), then \\(q_{D}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=ax_{1}^{2}+cx_{2}^{2}\\). This is special because there is no cross-term involving \\(x_{1}x_{2}\\).\nRemember that matrix transformations have the property that \\(T(s\\mathbf{x})=sT(\\mathbf{x})\\). Quadratic forms behave differently:\n\\[q_{A}(s\\mathbf{x})=(s\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(A(s\\mathbf{x}))=s^{2}\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A \\mathbf{x})=s^{2}q_{A}(\\mathbf{x}).\\]\nFor instance, when we multiply \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by the scalar 2, then \\(q_{A}(2\\mathbf{x})=4q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\). Also, notice that \\(q_{A}(-\\mathbf{x})=q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) since the scalar is squared.\nFinally, evaluating a quadratic form on an eigenvector has a particularly simple form. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). We then have\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})=\\lambda\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{ x}=\\lambda\\left|\\mathbf{x}\\right|^{2}.\\]\nLet's now return to our motivating question: in which direction \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the variance \\(V_{\\mathbf{u}}=\\mathbf{u}\\cdot(C\\mathbf{u})\\) of a dataset as large as possible and in which is it as small as possible. Remembering that the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is a unit vector, we can now state a more general form of this question: _If \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is a quadratic form, for which unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{u})=\\mathbf{u}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{u})\\) as large as possible and for which is it as small as possible?_ Since a unit vector specifies a direction, we will often ask for the directions in which the quadratic form \\(q(\\mathbf{x})\\) is at its maximum or minimum value.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### Basic Gauss-Newton algorithm\nThe idea behind the Gauss-Newton algorithm is simple: We alternate between finding an affine approximation of the function \\(f\\) at the current iterate, and then solving the associated linear least squares problem to find the next iterate. This combines two of the most powerful ideas in applied mathematics: _Calculus_ is used to form an affine approximation of a function near a given point, and _least squares_ is used to compute an approximate solution of the resulting affine equations.\nWe now describe the algorithm in more detail. At each iteration \\(k\\), we form the affine approximation \\(\\hat{f}\\) of \\(f\\) at the current iterate \\(x^{(k)}\\), given by the Taylor approximation\n\\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+Df(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)}),\\] (18.5)\nwhere the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) is the Jacobian or derivative matrix of \\(f\\) (see SS8.2.1 and SSC.1). The affine function \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\) is a very good approximation of \\(f(x)\\) provided \\(x\\) is near \\(x^{(k)}\\), _i.e._, \\(\\|x-x^{(k)}\\|\\) is small.\nThe next iterate \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is then taken to be the minimizer of \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\), the norm squared of the affine approximation of \\(f\\) at \\(x^{(k)}\\). Assuming that the derivative matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) has linearly independent columns (which requires \\(m\\geq n\\)), we have\n\\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\\left(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T} f(x^{(k)}).\\] (18.6)\nThis iteration gives the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm.\n**given** a differentiable function \\(f:\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), an initial point \\(x^{(1)}\\).\nFor \\(k=1,2,\\ldots,k^{\\max}\\)\n1. _Form affine approximation at current iterate using calculus._ Evaluate the Jacobian \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) and define \\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+Df(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)}).\\]\n2. _Update iterate using linear least squares._ Set \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) as the minimizer of \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\), \\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\\left(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T} f(x^{(k)}).\\]\nThe Gauss-Newton algorithm is terminated early if \\(f(x)\\) is very small, or \\(x^{(k+1)}\\approx x^{(k)}\\). It terminates with an error if the columns of \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) are linearly dependent.\nThe condition \\(x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}\\) (the exact form of our stopping condition) holds when\n\\[\\left(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T}f(x^{(k)})=0,\\]\nwhich occurs if and only if \\(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}f(x^{(k)})=0\\) (since we assume that \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) has linearly independent columns). So the Gauss-Newton algorithm stops only when the optimality condition (18.3) holds.\nWe can also observe that\n\\[\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k+1)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\leq\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}=\\|f(x^{(k) })\\|^{2}\\] (18.7)\nholds, since \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) minimizes \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\), and \\(\\hat{f}(x^{(k)};x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})\\). The norm of the _residual of the approximation_ goes down in each iteration. This is _not_ the same as\n\\[\\|f(x^{(k+1)})\\|^{2}\\leq\\|f(x^{(k)})\\|^{2},\\] (18.8)\n_i.e._, the norm of the _residual_ goes down in each iteration, which is what we would like.\nShortcomings of the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm.We will see in examples that the Gauss-Newton algorithm can work well, in the sense that the iterates \\(x^{(k)}\\) converge very quickly to a point with small residual. But the Gauss-Newton algorithm has two related serious shortcomings.\nThe first is that it can fail, by producing a sequence of points with the norm of the residual \\(\\|f(x^{(k)})\\|\\) increasing to large values, as opposed to decreasing to a small value, which is what we want. (In this case the algorithm is said to _diverge_.) The mechanism behind this failure is related to the difference between (18.7) and (18.8). The approximation\n\\[\\|f(x)\\|^{2}\\approx\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\]\nis guaranteed to hold only when \\(x\\) is near \\(x^{(k)}\\). So when \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is not near \\(x^{(k)}\\), \\(\\|f(x^{(k+1)})\\|^{2}\\) and \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k+1)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\) can be very different. In particular, the (true) residual at \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) can be _larger_ than the residual at \\(x^{(k)}\\).\n\n\n",

Several other examples are listed in appendix B.\n## 15 Multi-objective least squares\n### 15.1 A scalar multi-objective least squares problem\nWe consider the special case of the multi-objective least squares problem in which the variable \\(x\\) is a scalar, and the \\(k\\) matrices \\(A_{i}\\) are all \\(1\\times 1\\) matrices with value \\(A_{i}=1\\), so \\(J_{i}=(x-b_{i})^{2}\\). In this case our goal is to choose a number \\(x\\) that is simultaneously close to all the numbers \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{k}\\). Let \\(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k}\\) be positive weights, and \\(\\hat{x}\\) the minimizer of the weighted objective (15.1). Show that \\(\\hat{x}\\) is a weighted average (or convex combination; see page 15.1) of the numbers \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{k}\\), _i.e._, it has the form\n\\[x=w_{1}b_{1}+\\cdots+w_{k}b_{k},\\]\nwhere \\(w_{i}\\) are nonnegative and sum to one. Give an explicit formula for the combination weights \\(w_{i}\\) in terms of the multi-objective least squares weights \\(\\lambda_{i}\\).\nConsider the regularized data fitting problem (15.7). Recall that the elements in the first column of \\(A\\) are one. Let \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) be the solution of (15.7), _i.e._, the minimizer of\n\\[\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{2}+\\lambda(\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\theta_{p}^{2}),\\]\nand let \\(\\tilde{\\theta}\\) be the minimizer of\n\\[\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|\\theta\\|^{2}=\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{ 2}+\\lambda(\\theta_{1}^{2}+\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\theta_{p}^{2}),\\]\nin which we also penalize \\(\\theta_{1}\\). Suppose columns 2 through \\(p\\) of \\(A\\) have mean zero (for example, because features \\(2,\\ldots,p\\) have been standardized on the data set; see page 15.2). Show that \\(\\tilde{\\theta}_{k}=\\tilde{\\theta}_{k}\\) for \\(k=2,\\ldots,p\\).\n_Weighted Gram matrix_. Consider a multi-objective least squares problems with matrices \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{k}\\) and positive weights \\(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k}\\). The matrix\n\\[G=\\lambda_{1}A_{1}^{T}A_{1}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}A_{k}^{T}A_{k}\\]\nis called the _weighted Gram matrix_; it is the Gram matrix of the stacked matrix \\(\\tilde{A}\\) (given in (15.2)) associated with the multi-objective problem. Show that \\(G\\) is invertible provided there is no nonzero vector \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(A_{1}x=0,\\,\\ldots,\\,A_{k}x=0\\).\n_Robust approximate solution of linear equations._ We wish to solve the square set of \\(n\\) linear equations \\(Ax=b\\) for the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\). If \\(A\\) is invertible the solution is \\(x=A^{-1}b\\). In this exercise we address an issue that comes up frequently: We don't know \\(A\\) exactly. One simple method is to just choose a typical value of \\(A\\) and use it. Another method, which we explore here, takes into account the variation in the matrix \\(A\\). We find a set of \\(K\\) versions of \\(A\\), and denote them as \\(A^{(1)},\\ldots,A^{(K)}\\). (These could be found by measuring the matrix \\(A\\) at different times, for example.) Then we choose \\(x\\) so as to minimize\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe quantity \\(\\max\\left\\{\\rho^{\\mbox{\\tiny tar}}-r_{t},0\\right\\}\\) is the shortfall, _i.e._, the amount by which the return in period \\(t\\) falls short of the target; it is zero when the return exceeds the target value. The downside risk is the mean square value of the return shortfall.\n1. Formulate the portfolio optimization problem, using downside risk in place of the usual risk, as a constrained nonlinear least squares problem. Be sure to explain what the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are.\n2. Since the function \\(g\\) is affine (if you formulate the problem correctly), you can use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, modified to handle linear equality constraints, to approximately solve the problem. (See page 19.1) Find an expression for \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\). You can ignore the fact that the function \\(f\\) is not differentiable at some points.\n3. Implement the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find weights that minimize downside risk for a given target annualized return. A very reasonable starting point is the solution of the standard portfolio optimization problem with the same target return. Check your implementation with some simulated or real return data (available online). Compare the weights, and the risk and downside risk, for the minimum risk and the minimum downside risk portfolios.\n**19.3**: _Boolean least squares._ The _Boolean least squares problem_ is a special case of the constrained nonlinear least squares problem (19.1), with the form\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&x_{i}^{2}=1,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n,\\end{array}\\]\nwhere the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is the variable to be chosen, and the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) and the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\) are the (given) problem data. The constraints require that each entry of \\(x\\) is either \\(-1\\) or \\(+1\\), _i.e._, \\(x\\) is a Boolean vector. Since each entry can take one of two values, there are \\(2^{n}\\) feasible values for the vector \\(x\\). The Boolean least squares problem arises in many applications.\nOne simple method for solving the Boolean least squares problem, sometimes called the _brute force method_, is to evaluate the objective function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) for each of the \\(2^{n}\\) possible values, and choose one that has the least value. This method is not practical for \\(n\\) larger than 30 or so. There are many heuristic methods that are much faster to carry out than the brute force method, and approximately solve it, _i.e._, find an \\(x\\) for which the objective is small, if not the smallest possible value over all \\(2^{n}\\) feasible values of \\(x\\). One such heuristic is the augmented Lagrangian algorithm 19.2.\n1. Work out the details of the update step in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm used in each iteration of the augmented Lagrangian algorithm, for the Boolean least squares problem.\n2. Implement the augmented Lagrangian algorithm for the Boolean least squares problem. You can choose the starting point \\(x^{(1)}\\) as the minimizer of \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\). At each iteration, you can obtain a feasible point \\(\\tilde{x}^{(k)}\\) by rounding the entries of \\(x^{(k)}\\) to the values \\(\\pm 1\\), _i.e._, \\(\\tilde{x}^{(k)}=\\mbox{\\bf sign}(x^{(k)})\\). You should evaluate and plot the objective value of these feasible points, _i.e._, \\(\\|A\\tilde{x}^{(k)}-b\\|^{2}\\). Your implementation can return the best rounded value found during the iterations. Try your method on some small problems, with \\(n=m=10\\) (say), for which you can find the actual solution by the brute force method. Try it on much larger problems, with \\(n=m=500\\) (say), for which the brute force method is not practical.\n\n\n",

Recall how we used the fact that a symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable: if \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\), then \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{u})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{v})\\) where \\(\\mathbf{v}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{u}\\).\nMore generally, if we define \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), we have\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(QDQ^{T}\\mathbf{ x})=(Q^{T}\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(DQ^{T}\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{y}\\cdot(D\\mathbf{y})=q_{D}( \\mathbf{y})\\]\nRemembering that the quadratic form associated to a diagonal form has no cross terms, we obtain\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{y})=\\lambda_{1}y_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}y_{2}^{2}+ \\ldots+\\lambda_{m}y_{m}^{2}.\\]\nIn other words, after a change of coordinates, the quadratic form \\(q_{A}\\) can be written without cross terms. This is known as the Principle Axes Theorem.\n**Theorem 7.2.10**: **Principle Axes Theorem.** _If \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(m\\times m\\) matrix with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\lambda_{m}\\), then the quadratic form \\(q_{A}\\) can be written, after an orthogonal change of coordinates \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), as_\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\lambda_{1}y_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}y_{2}^{2}+\\ldots+\\lambda_{m }y_{m}^{2}.\\]\nWe will put this to use in the next section.\n#### Definite symmetric matrices\nWhile our questions about variance provide some motivation for exploring quadratic forms, these functions appear in a variety of other contexts so it's worth spending some more time with them. For example, quadratic forms appear in multivariable calculus when describing the behavior of a function of several variables near a critical point and in physics when describing the kinetic energy of a rigid body.\nFigure 7.2.9: The demeaned data from Preview Activity 7.2.1 is shown projected onto the lines of maximal and minimal variance.\nThe following definition will be important in this section.\n**Definition 7.2.11** A symmetric matrix \\(A\\) is called _positive definite_ if its associated quadratic form satisfies \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for any nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). If \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we say that \\(A\\) is _positive semidefinite_.\nLikewise, we say that \\(A\\) is _negative definite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nFinally, \\(A\\) is called _indefinite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for some \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for others.\n**Activity 7.2.4.** This activity explores the relationship between the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix and its definiteness.\n1. Consider the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{bmatrix}\\) and write its quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in terms of the components of \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). How does this help you decide whether \\(D\\) is positive definite or not?\n2. Now consider \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\) and write its quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in terms of \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\).

If \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), then we have \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{y})\\). Explain why this tells us that \\(A\\) is positive definite.\n5.

If \\(A\\) is a symmetric, invertible, positive definite matrix, then \\(A^{-1}\\) is also.\n**8.**: Determine whether the following statements are true or false and explain your reasoning.\n1. If \\(A\\) is an indefinite matrix, we can't know whether it is positive definite or not. 2. If the smallest eigenvalue of \\(A\\) is 3, then \\(A\\) is positive definite. 3. If \\(C\\) is the covariance matrix associated with a dataset, then \\(C\\) is positive semidefinite. 4. If \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix and the maximum and minimum values of \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{u})\\) occur at \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\), then \\(A\\) is diagonal. 5.

We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane. The function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is defined as\n\\[\\hat{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}p(x)&x\\leq a\\\\ q(x)&x>a,\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nwith \\(a\\) given, and \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) polynomials of degree three or less,\n\\[p(x)=\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x+\\theta_{3}x^{2}+\\theta_{4}x^{3},\\qquad q(x)=\\theta _{5}+\\theta_{6}x+\\theta_{7}x^{2}+\\theta_{8}x^{3}.\\]\nWe also impose the condition that \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\), so that \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is continuous and has a continuous first derivative at \\(x=a\\). Suppose the \\(N\\) data\nFigure 16.1: Least squares fit of two cubic polynomials to 140 points, with continuity constraints \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\).\npoints \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) are numbered so that \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{M}\\leq a\\) and \\(x_{M+1},\\ldots,x_{N}>a\\). The sum of squares of the prediction errors is\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{M}(\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x_{i}+\\theta_{3}x_{i}^{2}+\\theta_{4}x_{i}^{ 3}-y_{i})^{2}+\\sum_{i=M+1}^{N}(\\theta_{5}+\\theta_{6}x_{i}+\\theta_{7}x_{i}^{2}+ \\theta_{8}x_{i}^{3}-y_{i})^{2}.\\]\nThe conditions \\(p(a)-q(a)=0\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)-q^{\\prime}(a)=0\\) are two linear equations\n\\[\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}a+\\theta_{3}a^{2}+\\theta_{4}a^{3}-\\theta_{5} -\\theta_{6}a-\\theta_{7}a^{2}-\\theta_{8}a^{3} = 0\\] \\[\\theta_{2}+2\\theta_{3}a+3\\theta_{4}a^{2}-\\theta_{6}-2\\theta_{7}a- 3\\theta_{8}a^{2} = 0.\\]\nWe can determine the coefficients \\(\\hat{\\theta}=(\\hat{\\theta}_{1},\\ldots,\\hat{\\theta}_{8})\\) that minimize the sum of squares of the prediction errors, subject to the continuity constraints, by solving a constrained least squares problem\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|A\\theta-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&C\\theta=d.\\end{array}\\]\nThe matrices and vectors \\(A\\), \\(b\\), \\(C\\), \\(d\\) are defined as\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccc}1&x_{1}&x_{1}^{2}&x_{1}^{3}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 1&x_{2}&x_{2}^{2}&x_{2}^{3}&0&0&0&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 1&x_{M}&x_{M}^{2}&x_{M}^{3}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&x_{M+1}&x_{M+1}^{2}&x_{M+1}^{3}\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&x_{M+2}&x_{M+2}^{2}&x_{M+2}^{3}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&x_{N}&x_{N}^{2}&x_{N}^{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad b=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}y_{1}\\\\ y_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{M}\\\\ y_{M+1}\\\\ y_{M+2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ y_{N}\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nand\n\\[C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccc}1&a&a^{2}&a^{3}&-1&-a&-a^{2}&-a^{3}\\\\ 0&1&2a&3a^{2}&0&-1&-2a&-3a^{2}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad d=\\left[\\begin{array} []{c}0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis method is easily extended to piecewise-polynomial functions with more than two intervals. Functions of this kind are called _splines_.\nAdvertising budget allocation.We continue the example described on page 234, where the goal is to purchase advertising in \\(n\\) different channels so as to achieve (or approximately achieve) a target set of customer views or impressions in \\(m\\) different demographic groups. We denote the \\(n\\)-vector of channel spending as \\(s\\); this spending results in a set of views (across the demographic groups) given by the \\(m\\)-vector \\(Rs\\). We will minimize the sum of squares of the deviation from the target set of views, given by \\(v^{\\rm des}\\). In addition, we fix our total advertising spending, with the constraint \\({\\bf 1}^{T}s=B\\), where \\(B\\) is a given total advertising budget. (This can also be described as _allocating_ a total budget \\(B\\) across the \\(n\\) different channels.) This leads to the constrained least squares problem\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Rs-v^{\\rm des}\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&{\\bf 1}^{T}s=B.\\end{array}\\]\n(The solution \\(\\hat{s}\\) of this problem is not guaranteed to have nonnegative entries, as it must to make sense in this application. But we ignore this aspect of the problem here.)\nWe consider the same problem instance as on page 234, with \\(m=10\\) demographic groups and \\(n=3\\) channels, and reach matrix \\(R\\) given there. The least squares method yields an RMS error of 133 (around 13.3%), with a total budget of \\(\\mathbf{1}^{T}s^{\\mathrm{ls}}=1605\\). We seek a spending plan with a budget that is 20% smaller, \\(B=1284\\). Solving the associated constrained least squares problem yields the spending vector \\(s^{\\mathrm{cls}}=(315,110,859)\\), which has RMS error of 161 in the target views. We can compare this spending vector to the one obtained by simply scaling the least squares spending vector by 0.80. The RMS error for this allocation is 239. The resulting impressions for both spending plans are shown in figure 16.2.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\nThe number of times that \\(\\lambda_{j}-\\lambda\\) appears as a factor in the characteristic polynomial, is called the _multiplicity_ of the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{j}\\).\n**Example 4.2.7** We have seen that the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}&1&1\\\\ -1&3\\end{array}\\right]\\) has the characteristic equation \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\). This matrix has a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=2\\), which has multiplicity \\(2\\).\n**Example 4.2.8** If a matrix has the characteristic equation\n\\[(4-\\lambda)^{2}(-5-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)^{7}(3-\\lambda)^{2}=0,\\]\nthen that matrix has four eigenvalues: \\(\\lambda=4\\) having multiplicity \\(2\\); \\(\\lambda=-5\\) having multiplicity \\(1\\); \\(\\lambda=1\\) having multiplicity \\(7\\); and \\(\\lambda=3\\) having multiplicity \\(2\\). The degree of the characteristic polynomial is the sum of the multiplicities \\(2+1+7+2=12\\) so this matrix must be a \\(12\\times 12\\) matrix.\nThe multiplicities of the eigenvalues are important because they influence the dimension of the eigenspaces. We know that the dimension of an eigenspace must be at least one; the following proposition also tells us the dimension of an eigenspace can be no larger than the multiplicity of its associated eigenvalue.\n\n\n",

Therefore, if we multiply a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(A\\), we can\ndecompose the multiplication as\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=Q(D(Q^{T}\\mathbf{x})).\\]\nThat is, we first rotate \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(-45^{\\circ}\\), then apply the diagonal matrix \\(D\\), which stretches and reflects, and finally rotate by \\(45^{\\circ}\\). We may visualize this factorization as in Figure 7.1.8.\nIn fact, a similar picture holds any time the matrix \\(A\\) is orthogonally diagonalizable.\nWe have seen that a matrix that is orthogonally diagonalizable must be symmetric. In fact, it turns out that any symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable. We record this fact in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 7.1.9**: **The Spectral Theorem.** _The matrix \\(A\\) is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if \\(A\\) is symmetric._\nFigure 7.1.8: The transformation defined by \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\) can be interpreted as a sequence of geometric transformations: \\(Q^{T}\\) rotates by \\(-45^{\\circ}\\), \\(D\\) stretches and reflects, and \\(Q\\) rotates by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\n**Activity 7.1.3**.: Each of the following matrices is symmetric so the Spectral Theorem tells us that each is orthogonally diagonalizable. The point of this activity is to find an orthogonal diagonalization for each matrix.\nTo begin, find a basis for each eigenspace. Use this basis to find an orthogonal basis for each eigenspace and put these bases together to find an orthogonal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. Use this basis to write an orthogonal diagonalization of the matrix.\n1. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0&2\\\\ 2&3\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n2. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}4&-2&14\\\\ -2&19&-16\\\\ 14&-16&13\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n3. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}5&4&2\\\\ 4&5&2\\\\ 2&2&2\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n4. Consider the matrix \\(A=B^{T}B\\) where \\(B=\\begin{bmatrix}0&1&2\\\\ 2&0&1\\end{bmatrix}\\). Explain how we know that \\(A\\) is symmetric and then find an orthogonal diagonalization of \\(A\\).\nAs the examples in Activity 7.1.3 illustrate, the Spectral Theorem implies a number of things. Namely, if \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(m\\times m\\) matrix, then\n* the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are real.\n* there is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) consisting of eigenvectors.\n* two eigenvectors that are associated to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\nWe won't justify the first two facts here since that would take us rather far afield. However, it will be helpful to explain the third fact. To begin, notice the following:\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=\\mathbf{v}^{T}A\\mathbf{w}=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})^{T} \\mathbf{w}=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\nThis is a useful fact that we'll employ quite a bit in the future so let's summarize it in the following proposition.\n**Proposition 7.1.10**_For any matrix \\(A\\), we have_\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\n_In particular, if \\(A\\) is symmetric, then_\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=(A\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\n**Example 7.1.11** Suppose a symmetric matrix \\(A\\) has eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{1}=3\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{2}=10\\). Notice that\n\\[(A\\mathbf{v}_{1})\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2} =3\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}) =10\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nSince \\((A\\mathbf{v}_{1})\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{v}_{2})\\) by Proposition 7.1.10, we have\n\\[3\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}=10\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\]\nwhich can only happen if \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are orthogonal.\nMore generally, the same argument shows that two eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix associated to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n#### Variance\nMany of the ideas we'll encounter in this chapter, such as orthogonal diagonalizations, can be applied to the study of data. In fact, it can be useful to understand these applications because they provide an important context in which mathematical ideas have a more concrete meaning and their motivation appears more clearly. For that reason, we will now introduce the statistical concept of variance as a way to gain insight into the significance of orthogonal diagonalizations.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* We can use Sage to find the eigenvalues and eigenvalues of matrices. However, we need to be careful working with floating point numbers since floating point arithmetic is only an approximation.\n#### Exercises\n1.

If \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of multiplicity \\(1\\), then \\(E_{\\lambda}\\) is one-dimensional. 3. If a matrix \\(A\\) is invertible, then \\(\\lambda=0\\) cannot be an eigenvalue. 4. If \\(A\\) is a \\(13\\times 13\\) matrix, the characteristic polynomial has degree less than \\(13\\). 5.

Is there a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors of \\(A\\)? e. If the characteristic polynomial of \\(A\\) is \\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda),\\] what is the characteristic polynomial of \\(A^{2}\\)? what is the characteristic polynomial of \\(A^{-1}\\)?\n5.

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBy contrast, we have seen that the number of steps required to perform Gaussian elimination on an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix is proportional to \\(n^{3}\\). When \\(n=10\\), we have \\(n^{3}=1000\\), which points to the fact that finding the determinant using Gaussian elimination is considerably less work.\n#### Exercises\n1. Consider the matrices \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}2&1&0\\\\ -4&-4&3\\\\ 2&1&-3\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-2&3&0&0\\\\ 0&4&2&0\\\\ 4&-6&-1&2\\\\ 0&4&2&-3\\end{array}\\right].\\] 2. Find the determinants of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) using row operations. 3. Now find the determinants of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) using cofactor expansions to verify your results\n2. This exercise concerns rotations and reflections in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) is the matrix that performs a counterclockwise rotation in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). Draw a typical picture of the vectors that form the columns of \\(A\\) and use the geometric definition of the determinant to determine \\(\\det(A)\\). 2. Suppose that \\(B\\) is the matrix that performs a reflection in a line passing through the origin. Draw a typical picture of the columns of \\(B\\) and use the geometric definition of the determinant to determine \\(\\det(B)\\). 3. As we saw in Section 2.6, the matrices have the form \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\\cos\\theta&-\\sin\\theta\\\\ \\sin\\theta&\\cos\\theta\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad B=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr} \\cos(2\\theta)&\\sin(2\\theta)\\\\ \\sin(2\\theta)&-\\cos(2\\theta)\\end{array}\\right].\\] 3. Compute the determinants of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and verify that they agree with what you found in the earlier parts of this exercise.\n3. In the next chapter, we will say that matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are _similar_ if there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A=PBP^{-1}\\). 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are matrices and that there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A=PBP^{-1}\\). Explain why \\(\\det(A)=\\det(B)\\).\n2. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix and that there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\[A=P\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2&0&0\\\\ 0&-5&0\\\\ 0&0&-3\\end{array}\\right]P^{-1}.\\] Find \\(\\det(A)\\).\n4. Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-2&1&k\\\\ 2&3&0\\\\ 1&2&2\\end{array}\\right]\\] where \\(k\\) is a parameter. 1. Find an expression for \\(\\det(A)\\) in terms of the parameter \\(k\\). 2. Use your expression for \\(\\det(A)\\) to determine the values of \\(k\\) for which the vectors \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 3\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}k\\\\ 0\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly independent.\n5. Determine whether the following statements are true or false and explain your response. 1. If we have a square matrix \\(A\\) and multiply the first row by \\(5\\) and add it to the third row to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=5\\det(A)\\). 2. If we interchange two rows of a matrix, then the determinant is unchanged. 3. If we scale a row of the matrix \\(A\\) by \\(17\\) to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=17\\det(A)\\). 4. If \\(A\\) and \\(A^{\\prime}\\) are row equivalent and \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=0\\), then \\(\\det(A)=0\\) also. 5. If \\(A\\) is row equivalent to the identity matrix, then \\(\\det(A)=\\det(I)=1\\).\n6. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(5\\times 5\\) matrices such that \\(\\det(A)=-2\\) and \\(\\det(B)=5\\). Find the following determinants: 1. \\(\\det(2A)\\). 2. \\(\\det(A^{3})\\). 3. \\(\\det(AB)\\). 4. \\(\\det(-A)\\). 5. \\(\\det(AB^{-1})\\).\n7. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(n\\times n\\) matrices. 1. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both invertible, use determinants to explain why \\(AB\\) is invertible. 2. If \\(AB\\) is invertible, use determinants to explain why both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are invertible.\n**8.**: Provide a justification for your responses to the following questions.\n\n\n",

We are particularly interested in representing a subspace as the span of a linearly independent set of vectors.\n**Definition 3.5.4** A _basis_ for a subspace \\(S\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) is a set of vectors in \\(S\\) that are linearly independent and whose span is \\(S\\). We say that the _dimension_ of the subspace \\(S\\), denoted \\(\\dim S\\)\nFigure 3.5.3: Two lines in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), one of which is a subspace and one of which is not.\nis the number of vectors in any basis.\n**Example 3.5.5**: **A subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).** Suppose we have the 4-dimensional vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) that define the subspace \\(S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).

Therefore, any linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) can be rewritten\n\\[c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}=(c_{1}-c_{2}) \\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\]\nas a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\). This tells us that\n\\[S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}= \\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}.\\]\nFurthermore, the reduced row echelon form of the matrix shows that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) are linearly independent. Therefore, \\(\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}\\) is a basis for \\(S\\), which means that \\(S\\) is a two-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).\nSubspaces of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) are either\n* \\(0\\)-dimensional, consisting of the single vector \\(\\mathbf{0}\\),\n* a \\(1\\)-dimensional line,\n* a \\(2\\)-dimensional plane, or\n* the \\(3\\)-dimensional subspace \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\nThere is no 4-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) because there is no linearly independent set of four vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\nThere are two important subspaces associated to any matrix, each of which springs from one of our two fundamental questions, as we will now see.\n#### The column space of \\(A\\)\nThe first subspace associated to a matrix that we'll consider is its column space.\n**Definition 3.5.6**: If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, we call the span of its columns the _column space_ of \\(A\\) and denote it as \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nNotice that the columns of \\(A\\) are vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), which means that any linear combination of the columns is also in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). Since the column space is described as the span of a set of vectors, we see that \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\n**Activity 3.5.3**.: We will explore some column spaces in this activity.\n1.

Let \\(x\\) be an \\(n\\)-vector which satisfies \\((A^{T}A)x=0\\). Multiplying on the left by \\(x^{T}\\) we get\n\\[0=x^{T}0=x^{T}(A^{T}Ax)=x^{T}A^{T}Ax=\\|Ax\\|^{2},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(Ax=0\\). Since the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent, we conclude that \\(x=0\\). Since the only solution of \\((A^{T}A)x=0\\) is \\(x=0\\), we conclude that \\(A^{T}A\\) is invertible.\nNow let's show the converse. Suppose the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly dependent, which means there is a nonzero \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) which satisfies \\(Ax=0\\). Multiply on the left by \\(A^{T}\\) to get \\((A^{T}A)x=0\\). This shows that the Gram matrix \\(A^{T}A\\) is singular.\nPseudo-inverse of square or tall matrix.We show here that if \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns (and therefore, is square or tall) then it has a left inverse. (We already have observed the converse, that a matrix with a left inverse has linearly independent columns.) Assuming \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns, we know that \\(A^{T}A\\) is invertible. We now observe that the matrix \\((A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}\\) is a left inverse of \\(A\\):\n\\[\\left((A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}\\right)A=(A^{T}A)^{-1}(A^{T}A)=I.\\]\nThis particular left-inverse of \\(A\\) will come up in the sequel, and has a name,\nFigure 11.3: Temperature distribution on a \\(100\\times 100\\) grid of nodes. Nodes in the top and bottom rows are held at zero temperature. The three sets of nodes with rectilinear shapes are held at temperature one.\nthe _pseudo-inverse_ of \\(A\\). It is denoted \\(A^{\\dagger}\\) (or \\(A^{+}\\)):\n\\[A^{\\dagger}=(A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}.\\] (11.5)\nThe pseudo-inverse is also called the _Moore-Penrose inverse_, after the mathematicians Eliakim Moore and Roger Penrose.\nWhen \\(A\\) is square, the pseudo-inverse \\(A^{\\dagger}\\) reduces to the ordinary inverse:\n\\[A^{\\dagger}=(A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}=A^{-1}A^{-T}A^{T}=A^{-1}I=A^{-1}.\\]\nNote that this equation does not make sense (and certainly is not correct) when \\(A\\) is not square.\nPseudo-inverse of a square or wide matrix.Transposing all the equations, we can show that a (square or wide) matrix \\(A\\) has a right inverse if and only if its rows are linearly independent. Indeed, one right inverse is given by\n\\[A^{T}(AA^{T})^{-1}.\\] (11.6)\n(The matrix \\(AA^{T}\\) is invertible if and only if the rows of \\(A\\) are linearly independent.)\nThe matrix in (11.6) is also referred to as the pseudo-inverse of \\(A\\), and denoted \\(A^{\\dagger}\\). The only possible confusion in defining the pseudo-inverse using the two different formulas (11.5) and (11.6) occurs when the matrix \\(A\\) is square. In this case, however, they both reduce to the ordinary inverse:\n\\[A^{T}(AA^{T})^{-1}=A^{T}A^{-T}A^{-1}=A^{-1}.\\]\nPseudo-inverse in other cases.The pseudo-inverse \\(A^{\\dagger}\\) is defined for any matrix, including the case when \\(A\\) is tall but its columns are linearly dependent, the case when \\(A\\) is wide but its rows are linearly dependent, and the case when \\(A\\) is square but not invertible. In these cases, however, it is not a left inverse, right inverse, or inverse, respectively. We mention it here since the reader may encounter it. (We will see what \\(A^{\\dagger}\\) means in these cases in exercise 11.)\n\n\n",

Return the answer as a list with ascending order.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe first is that it can fail, by producing a sequence of points with the norm of the residual \\(\\|f(x^{(k)})\\|\\) increasing to large values, as opposed to decreasing to a small value, which is what we want. (In this case the algorithm is said to _diverge_.) The mechanism behind this failure is related to the difference between (18.7) and (18.8). The approximation\n\\[\\|f(x)\\|^{2}\\approx\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\]\nis guaranteed to hold only when \\(x\\) is near \\(x^{(k)}\\). So when \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is not near \\(x^{(k)}\\), \\(\\|f(x^{(k+1)})\\|^{2}\\) and \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k+1)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\) can be very different. In particular, the (true) residual at \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) can be _larger_ than the residual at \\(x^{(k)}\\).\nThe second serious shortcoming of the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm is the assumption that the columns of the derivative matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) are linearly independent. In some applications, this assumption never holds; in others, it can fail to hold at some iterate \\(x^{(k)}\\), in which case the Gauss-Newton algorithm stops, since \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is not defined.\nWe will see that a simple modification of the Gauss-Newton algorithm, described below in SS18.3, addresses both of these shortcomings.\n#### Newton algorithm\nFor the special case \\(m=n\\), the Gauss-Newton algorithm reduces to another famous algorithm for solving a set of \\(n\\) nonlinear equations in \\(n\\) variables, called the Newton algorithm. (The algorithm is sometimes called the Newton-Raphson algorithm, since Newton developed the method only for the special case \\(n=1\\), and Joseph Raphson later extended it to the case \\(n>1\\).)\nWhen \\(m=n\\), the matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) is square, so the basic Gauss-Newton update (18.6) can be simplified to\n\\[x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)}-(Df(x^{(k)}))^{-1}(Df(x^{(k)})^{T})^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T} f(x^{(k)})\\] \\[= x^{(k)}-(Df(x^{(k)}))^{-1}f(x^{(k)}).\\]\nThis iteration gives the Newton algorithm.\n**Algorithm 18.2** Newton algorithm for solving nonlinear equations\n**given** a differentiable function \\(f:\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\), an initial point \\(x^{(1)}\\).\nFor \\(k=1,2,\\ldots,k^{\\max}\\)\n1. _Form affine approximation at current iterate_. Evaluate the Jacobian \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) and define \\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+Df(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)}).\\]\n2. _Update iterate by solving linear equations_. Set \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) as the solution of \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=0\\), \\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\\left(Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}f(x^{(k)}).\\]\n**Algorithm 18.2** Newton algorithm for solving nonlinear equations\nThe basic Newton algorithm shares the same shortcomings as the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm, _i.e._, it can diverge, and the iterations terminate if the derivative matrix is not invertible.\nNewton algorithm for \\(n=1\\).The Newton algorithm is easily understood for \\(n=1\\). The iteration is\n\\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-f(x^{(k)})/f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})\\] (18.9)\nand is illustrated in figure 18.2. To update \\(x^{(k)}\\) we form the Taylor approximation\n\\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)})\\]\nand set it to zero to find the next iterate \\(x^{(k+1)}\\). If \\(f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})\\neq 0\\), the solution of \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=0\\) is given by the right-hand side of (18.9). If \\(f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})=0\\), the Newton algorithm terminates with an error.\nFigure 18.2: One iteration of the Newton algorithm for solving an equation \\(f(x)=0\\) in one variable.\n**Example.** The function\n\\[f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}\\] (18.10)\nhas a unique zero at the origin, _i.e._, the only solution of \\(f(x)=0\\) is \\(x=0\\). (This function is called the _sigmoid function_, and will make another appearance later.) The Newton iteration started at \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) converges quickly to the solution \\(x=0\\). With \\(x^{(1)}=1.15\\), however, the iterates diverge. This is shown in figures 18.3 and 18.4.\nFigure 18.4: Value of \\(f(x^{(k)})\\) versus iteration number \\(k\\) for Newton’s method in the example of figure 18.3, started at \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) and \\(x^{(1)}=1.15\\).\nFigure 18.3: The first iterations in the Newton algorithm for solving \\(f(x)=0\\), for two starting points: \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) and \\(x^{(1)}=1.15\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nwhich implies that there is a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\). We find that\n\\[A-(-1)I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich says that every two-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) satisfies \\((A-(-1)I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Therefore, every vector is an eigenvector and so \\(E_{-1}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). This eigenspace is two-dimensional.\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\nThe number of times that \\(\\lambda_{j}-\\lambda\\) appears as a factor in the characteristic polynomial, is called the _multiplicity_ of the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{j}\\).\n**Example 4.2.7** We have seen that the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}&1&1\\\\ -1&3\\end{array}\\right]\\) has the characteristic equation \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\). This matrix has a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=2\\), which has multiplicity \\(2\\).\n**Example 4.2.8** If a matrix has the characteristic equation\n\\[(4-\\lambda)^{2}(-5-\\lambda)(1-\\lambda)^{7}(3-\\lambda)^{2}=0,\\]\nthen that matrix has four eigenvalues: \\(\\lambda=4\\) having multiplicity \\(2\\); \\(\\lambda=-5\\) having multiplicity \\(1\\); \\(\\lambda=1\\) having multiplicity \\(7\\); and \\(\\lambda=3\\) having multiplicity \\(2\\). The degree of the characteristic polynomial is the sum of the multiplicities \\(2+1+7+2=12\\) so this matrix must be a \\(12\\times 12\\) matrix.\n\n\n",

More specifically, any matrix \\(A\\) defines a function\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|A\\mathbf{x}|,\\]\nwhich measures the length of \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\). For example, the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-2\\end{bmatrix}\\) gives the function \\(l_{D}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{9x_{1}^{2}+4x_{2}^{2}}\\). The presence of the square root means that this function is not a quadratic form. We can, however, define the singular values and vectors by looking for the maximum and minimum of this function \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{u})\\) among all unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\).\nWhile \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is not itself a quadratic form, it becomes one if we square it:\n\\[(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x}))^{2}=|A\\mathbf{x}|^{2}=(A\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})= \\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A^{T}A\\mathbf{x})=q_{A^{T}A}(\\mathbf{x}).\\]\nWe call \\(G=A^{T}A\\), the _Gram matrix_ associated to \\(A\\) and note that\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}.\\]\nThis is important in the next activity, which introduces singular values and singular vectors.\n**Activity 7.4.2**.: The following interactive figure will help us explore singular values and vectors geometrically before we begin a more algebraic approach.\nThere is an interactive diagram, available at gvsu.edu/s/0VE, that accompanies this activity.\n**Figure 7.4.1** Singular values, right singular vectors and left singular vectors\nSelect the matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\ -2&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\). As we vary the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we see the vector \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) on the right in gray while the height of the blue bar to the right tells us \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|A\\mathbf{x}|\\).\n* The first _singular value_\\(\\sigma_{1}\\) is the maximum value of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and an associated _right singular vector_\\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) is a unit vector describing a direction in which this maximum occurs. Use the diagram to find the first singular value \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\).\n* The second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) is the minimum value of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) is a unit vector describing a direction in which this minimum occurs. Use the diagram to find the second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n* Here's how we can find the right singular values and vectors without using the diagram. Remember that \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\) where \\(G=A^{T}A\\) is the Gram matrix associated to \\(A\\). Since \\(G\\) is symmetric, it is orthogonally diagonalizable. Find \\(G\\) and an orthogonal diagonalization of it.\nWhat is the maximum value of the quadratic form \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) among all unit vectors and in which direction does it occur? What is the minimum value of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and in which direction does it occur?\n* Because \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\), the first singular value \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) will be the square root of the maximum value of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) the square root of the minimum. Verify that the singular values that you found from the diagram are the square roots of the maximum and minimum values of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\).\n* Verify that the right singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) that you found from the diagram are the directions in which the maximum and minimum values occur.\n* Finally, we introduce the _left singular vectors_\\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) by requiring that \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\sigma_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\). Find the two left singular vectors.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Set each pixel value \\(y_{i}\\) to be the average of the neighbors of pixel \\(i\\) in the original image.

We seek the coefficients that satisfy\n\\[p(-1.1)=b_{1},\\qquad p(-0.4)=b_{2},\\qquad p(0.2)=b_{3},\\qquad p(0.8)=b_{4}.\\]\nWe can express this as the system of 4 equations in 4 variables \\(Ac=b\\), where\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr}1&-1.1&(-1.1)^{2}&(-1.1)^{3}\\\\ 1&-0.4&(-0.4)^{2}&(-0.4)^{3}\\\\ 1&0.2&(0.2)^{2}&(0.2)^{3}\\\\ 1&0.8&(0.8)^{2}&(0.8)^{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich is a specific Vandermonde matrix (see (6.7)). The unique solution is \\(c=A^{-1}b\\), where\n\\[A^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr}-0.5784&1.9841&-2.1368&0.7310\\\\ 0.3470&0.1984&-1.4957&0.9503\\\\ 0.1388&-1.8651&1.6239&0.1023\\\\ -0.0370&0.3492&0.7521&-0.0643\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n(to 4 decimal places). This is illustrated in figure 11.1, which shows the two cubic polynomials that interpolate the two sets of points shown as filled circles and squares, respectively.\nThe columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are interesting: They give the coefficients of a polynomial that evaluates to 0 at three of the points, and 1 at the other\nfirst column of \\(A^{-1}\\), which is \\(A^{-1}e_{1}\\), gives the coefficients of the polynomial that has value 1 at \\(-1.1\\), and value 0 at \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, and 0.8. The four polynomials with coefficients given by the columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are called the _Lagrange polynomials_ associated with the points \\(-1.1\\), \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, 0.8. These are plotted in figure 11.2. (The Lagrange polynomials are named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, whose name will re-appear in several other contexts.)\nThe rows of \\(A^{-1}\\) are also interesting: The \\(i\\)th row shows how the values \\(b_{1}\\), ..., \\(b_{4}\\), the polynomial values at the points \\(-1.1\\), \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, 0.8, map into the \\(i\\)th coefficient of the polynomial, \\(c_{i}\\). For example, we see that the coefficient \\(c_{4}\\) is not very sensitive to the value of \\(b_{1}\\) (since \\((A^{-1})_{41}\\) is small). We can also see that for each increase of one in \\(b_{4}\\), the coefficient \\(c_{2}\\) increases by around 0.95.\nBalancing chemical reactions.(See page 154 for background.)

A linear system where the right hand side of every equation is 0 is called _homogeneous_. The augmented matrix of a homogeneous system, for instance, has the following form: \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}*&*&*&*&0\\\\ *&*&*&*&0\\\\ *&*&*&*&0\\end{array}\\right].\\] 1. Using the concepts we've seen in this section, explain why a homogeneous linear system must be consistent. 2. What values for the variables are guaranteed to give a solution? Use this to offer another explanation for why a homogeneous linear system is consistent. 3. Suppose that a homogeneous linear system has a unique solution. 1. Give an example of such a system by writing its augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form. 2. Write just the coefficient matrix for the example you gave in the previous part. What can you say about the pivot positions in the coefficient matrix? Explain why your observation must hold for any homogeneous system having a unique solution. 3. If a homogeneous system of equations has a unique solution, what can you say about the number of equations compared to the number of variables?\nIn a previous math class, you have probably seen the fact that, if we are given two points in the plane, then there is a unique line passing through both of them. In this problem, we will begin with the four points on the left below and ask to find a polynomial that passes through these four points as shown on the right.\nA degree three polynomial can be written as\n\\[p(x)=a+bx+cx^{2}+dx^{3}\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are coefficients that we would like to determine. Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point \\((3,1)\\), we should require that\n\\[p(3)=a+3b+9c+27d=1.\\]\nIn this way, we obtain a linear equation for the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).\n1. Write the four linear equations for the coefficients obtained by requiring that the graph of the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) passes through the four points above. 2. Write the augmented matrix corresponding to this system of equations and use the Sage cell below to solve for the coefficients.\n2. Write the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) that you found and check your work by graphing it in the Sage cell below and verifying that it passes through the four points. To plot a function over a range, you may use a command like plot(1 + x- 2*x^2, xmin = -1, xmax = 4).\n3. Rather than looking for a degree three polynomial, suppose we wanted to find a polynomial that passes through the four points and that has degree two, such as \\[p(x)=a+bx+cx^{2}.\\]\n\n\n",

Find the determinant of the linear transformation D(f) = f' from V to V.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### Chapter 4.2 Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nThe last section introduced eigenvalues and eigenvectors, presented the underlying geometric intuition behind their definition, and demonstrated their use in understanding the long-term behavior of certain systems. We will now develop a more algebraic understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we will find an algebraic method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.\n**Preview Activity 4.2.1.** Let's begin by reviewing some important ideas that we have seen previously.\n1. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIf \\(A\\) is the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\quad\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\right]\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\), we have\n\\[A^{T}\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nDescribing vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) that are orthogonal to both \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\) is therefore equivalent to the more familiar task of describing the solution set \\(A^{T}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). To do so, we find the reduced row echelon form of \\(A^{T}\\) and write the solution set parametrically as\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=x_{3}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]+x_{4}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ -2\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nOnce again, the distributive property of dot products tells us that such a vector is also orthogonal to any linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\) so this solution set is, in fact, the orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\). Indeed, we see that the vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ -2\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nform a basis for \\(W^{\\perp}\\), which is a two-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).\nTo place this example in a slightly more general context, note that \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\), the columns of \\(A\\), form a basis of \\(W\\). Since \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), the column space of \\(A\\) is the subspace of linear combinations of the columns of \\(A\\), we have \\(W=\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nThis example also shows that the orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}=\\operatorname{Col}(A)^{\\perp}\\) is described by the solution set of \\(A^{T}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This solution set is what we have called \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\), the null space of \\(A^{T}\\). In this way, we see the following proposition, which is visually represented in Figure 6.2.11.\n**Proposition 6.2.10**_For any matrix \\(A\\), the orthogonal complement of \\(Col(A)\\) is \\(Nul(A^{T})\\); that is,_\n\\[Col(A)^{\\perp}=Nul(A^{T}).\\]\n#### Properties of the matrix transpose\nThe transpose is a simple algebraic operation performed on a matrix. The next activity explores some of its properties.\n**Activity 6.2.4**.: In Sage, the transpose of a matrix \\(A\\) is given by \\(A.T.\\) Define the matrices\n\\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&0&-3\\\\ 2&-2&1\\end{bmatrix},\\ \\ B=\\begin{bmatrix}3&-4&1\\\\ 0&1&2\\end{bmatrix},\\ \\ C=\\begin{bmatrix}1&0&-3\\\\ 2&-2&1\\\\ 3&2&0\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n1. Evaluate \\((A+B)^{T}\\) and \\(A^{T}+B^{T}\\). What do you notice about the relationship between these two matrices?\n2. What happens if you transpose a matrix twice; that is, what is \\((A^{T})^{T}\\)?\n3. Find \\(\\det(C)\\) and \\(\\det(C^{T})\\). What do you notice about the relationship between these determinants?\n4. Find the product \\(AC\\) and its transpose \\((AC)^{T}\\).\n5. Is it possible to compute the product \\(A^{T}C^{T}\\)? Explain why or why not.\n6. Find the product \\(C^{T}A^{T}\\) and compare it to \\((AC)^{T}\\). What do you notice about the relationship between these two matrices?\n7. What is the transpose of the identity matrix \\(I\\)?\n8. If a square matrix \\(D\\) is invertible, explain why you can guarantee that \\(D^{T}\\) is invertible and why \\((D^{T})^{-1}=(D^{-1})^{T}\\).\nIn spite of the fact that we are looking at some specific examples, this activity demonstrates\nFigure 6.2.11: The orthogonal complement of the column space of \\(A\\) is the null space of \\(A^{T}\\).\nthe following general properties of the transpose, which may be verified with a little effort.\n**Properties of the transpose.**\nHere are some properties of the matrix transpose, expressed in terms of general matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). We assume that \\(C\\) is a square matrix.\n* If \\(A+B\\) is defined, then \\((A+B)^{T}=A^{T}+B^{T}\\).\n* \\((sA)^{T}=sA^{T}\\).\n* \\((A^{T})^{T}=A\\).\n* \\(\\det(C)=\\det(C^{T})\\).\n* If \\(AB\\) is defined, then \\((AB)^{T}=B^{T}A^{T}\\). Notice that the order of the multiplication is reversed.\n* \\((C^{T})^{-1}=(C^{-1})^{T}\\).\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many triangles are there whose sides are all integers and whose maximum side length equals 11?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nFor one, two, and three dimensions, this distance is exactly the usual distance between points with coordinates \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), as illustrated in figure 3.1. But the Euclidean distance is defined for vectors of any dimension; we can refer to the distance between two vectors of dimension 100. Since we only use the Euclidean norm in this book, we will refer to the Euclidean distance between vectors as, simply, the distance between the vectors. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(n\\)-vectors, we refer to the RMS value of the difference, \\(\\|a-b\\|/\\sqrt{n}\\), as the _RMS deviation_ between the two vectors.\nWhen the distance between two \\(n\\)-vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is small, we say they are 'close' or 'nearby', and when the distance \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) is large, we say they are 'far'. The particular numerical values of \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) that correspond to 'close' or 'far' depend on\nFigure 3.1: The norm of the displacement \\(b-a\\) is the distance between the points with coordinates \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nAs an example, consider the 4-vectors\n\\[u=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.8\\\\ 2.0\\\\ -3.7\\\\ 4.7\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad v=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.6\\\\ 2.1\\\\ 1.9\\\\ -1.4\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad w=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2.0\\\\ 1.9\\\\ -4.0\\\\ 4.6\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe distances between pairs of them are\n\\[\\|u-v\\|=8.368,\\qquad\\|u-w\\|=0.387,\\qquad\\|v-w\\|=8.533,\\]\nso we can say that \\(u\\) is much nearer (or closer) to \\(w\\) than it is to \\(v\\). We can also say that \\(w\\) is much nearer to \\(u\\) than it is to \\(v\\).\nTriangle inequality.We can now explain where the triangle inequality gets its name. Consider a triangle in two or three dimensions, whose vertices have coordinates \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The lengths of the sides are the distances between the vertices,\n\\[\\mathbf{dist}(a,b)=\\|a-b\\|,\\qquad\\mathbf{dist}(b,c)=\\|b-c\\|,\\qquad\\mathbf{dist }(a,c)=\\|a-c\\|.\\]\nGeometric intuition tells us that the length of any side of a triangle cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. For example, we have\n\\[\\|a-c\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\] (3.3)\nThis follows from the triangle inequality, since\n\\[\\|a-c\\|=\\|(a-b)+(b-c)\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\]\nThis is illustrated in figure 3.2.\nFigure 3.2: Triangle inequality.\n#### Examples.\n* _Feature distance._ If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent vectors of \\(n\\) features of two objects, the quantity \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) is called the _feature distance_, and gives a measure of how different the objects are (in terms of their feature values). Suppose for example the feature vectors are associated with patients in a hospital, with entries such as weight, age, presence of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and the results of tests. We can use feature vector distance to say that one patient case is near another one (at least in terms of their feature vectors).\n* _RMS prediction error._ Suppose that the \\(n\\)-vector \\(y\\) represents a time series of some quantity, for example, hourly temperature at some location, and \\(\\hat{y}\\) is another \\(n\\)-vector that represents an estimate or prediction of the time series \\(y\\), based on other information. The difference \\(y-\\hat{y}\\) is called the _prediction error_, and its RMS value \\(\\mathbf{rms}(y-\\hat{y})\\) is called the _RMS prediction error_. If this value is small (say, compared to \\(\\mathbf{rms}(y)\\)) the prediction is good.\n* _Nearest neighbor._ Suppose \\(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{m}\\) is a collection of \\(m\\)\\(n\\)-vectors, and that \\(x\\) is another \\(n\\)-vector. We say that \\(z_{j}\\) is the _nearest neighbor_ of \\(x\\) (among \\(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{m}\\)) if \\[\\|x-z_{j}\\|\\leq\\|x-z_{i}\\|,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,m.\\] In words: \\(z_{j}\\) is the closest vector to \\(x\\) among the vectors \\(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{m}\\). This is illustrated in figure 3.3. The idea of nearest neighbor, and generalizations such as the \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors, are used in many applications.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots&T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSaid simply, this proposition means says that if have a function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and can verify the two linearity properties stated in the proposition, then we know that \\(T\\) is a matrix transformation. Let's see how this works in practice.\n**Example 2.6.4** We will consider the function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that rotates a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) in the counterclockwise direction to obtain \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as seen in Figure 2.6.5.\nWe first need to know that \\(T\\) can be represented by a matrix transformation, which means, by Proposition 2.6.3, that we need to verify the linearity properties:\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe next two figures illustrate why these properties hold. For instance, Figure 2.6.6 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) when \\(c\\) is a scalar. In particular, scaling a vector and then rotating it is the same as rotating and then scaling it, which means that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nThis leads to \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\). In the same way, we find that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\) so that the matrix \\(A\\) is\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nYou may wish to check this using the interactive diagram in the previous activity using the approximation \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\approx 0.7\\).\nIn this example, we found that \\(T\\), a function describing a rotation in the plane, was in fact a matrix transformation by checking that\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe same kind of thinking applies more generally to show that rotations, reflections, and scalings are matrix transformations. Similarly, we could revisit the functions in Activity 2.5.3 and verify that they are matrix transformations.\n**Activity 2.6.3**. In this activity, we seek to describe various matrix transformations by finding the matrix that gives the desired transformation. All of the transformations that we study here have the form \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\).\n1. Find the matrix of the transformation that has no effect on vectors; that is, \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\).\n2. Find the matrix of the transformation that reflects vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) across the line \\(y=x\\).\n\n\n",

If \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), find the product \\(Q^{T}Q\\) and explain your result.\nThis activity demonstrates one issue of note. We found \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\), by requiring that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) be orthogonal to \\(W\\). In other words, \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is a vector in the orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\), which we may denote \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\). This explains the following proposition, which is illustrated in Figure 6.3.19\n**Proposition 6.3.18**: _If \\(W\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) with orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\), then any \\(n\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) can be uniquely written as_\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}+\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\]\n_where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W^{\\perp}\\)._\nLet's summarize what we've found. If \\(Q\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) form an orthonormal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then\n* \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix, because this product computes the dot products between the columns of \\(Q\\).\n* \\(QQ^{T}\\) is the matrix the projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\).\nAs we've said before, matrix multiplication depends on the order in which we multiply the matrices, and we see this clearly here.\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\nFigure 6.3.19: A vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) along with \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the line \\(L\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement \\(L^{\\perp}\\).\n**Example 6.3.20** Consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn this case, \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) span a plane, a 2-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).

We know that \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{2}\\) and \\(QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto the plane. However, \\(Q\\) is not a square matrix so it cannot be invertible.\n**Example 6.3.21** Now consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -2/\\sqrt{6}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}&1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}&-1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}&0&-2/\\sqrt{6}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\) form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) so that both \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{3}\\) and \\(QQ^{T}=I_{3}\\). Therefore, \\(Q\\) is a square matrix and is invertible.\nMoreover, since \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), we see that \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\) so finding the inverse of \\(Q\\) is as simple as writing its transpose. Matrices with this property are very special and will play an important role in our upcoming work. We will therefore give them a special name.\n**Definition 6.3.22** A square \\(m\\times m\\) matrix \\(Q\\) whose columns form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is called _orthogonal_.\nThis terminology can be a little confusing. We call a basis orthogonal if the basis vectors are orthogonal to one another. However, a matrix is orthogonal if the columns are orthogonal to one another and have unit length. It pays to keep this in mind when reading statements about orthogonal bases and orthogonal matrices. In the meantime, we record the following proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.23**_An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is invertible and its inverse \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\)._\n#### Summary\nThis section introduced orthogonal sets and the projection formula that allows us to project vectors orthogonally onto a subspace.\n* Given an orthogonal set \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_{n}\\) that spans an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector in \\(W\\) closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and may be written as \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{1}}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{1}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{1}+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{2}}{\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{2}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\\mathbf{w}_{n} \\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{n}.\\]\n* If \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(W\\) and \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\), then the matrix \\(P=QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\).\n* If the columns of \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal basis for an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), then \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\).\n* An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is a square matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis.
