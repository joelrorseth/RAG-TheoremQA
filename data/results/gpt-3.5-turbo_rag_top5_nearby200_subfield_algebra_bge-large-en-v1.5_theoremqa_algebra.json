        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nFind the x value of the solutions to the linear system: 7x - y = 15x, -6x + 8y = 15y.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow let's ask Sage to compute with real numbers. We can do this by representing one of the coefficients as a decimal. For instance, the same linear system can be represented as\n\\[x+0.5y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+ \\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+ \\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] Most computers do arithmetic using either 32 or 64 bits. To magnify the problem so that we can see it better, we will ask Sage to do arithmetic using only 10 bits as follows.\n``` R=RealNumber RealNumber=RealField(10)\n#ent\nWhat does Sage give for the solution now? Compare this to the exact solution that you found previously.\n2. Some types of linear systems are particularly sensitive to errors resulting from computers' approximate arithmetic. For instance, suppose we are interested in the linear system \\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2\\] Find the solution to this linear system.\nSuppose now that the computer has accumulated some error in one of the entries of this system so that it incorrectly stores the system as\n\\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2.001\\]\nFind the solution to this linear system.\nNotice how a small error in one of the entries in the linear system leads to a solution that has a dramatically large error. Fortunately, this is an issue that has been well studied, and there are techniques that mitigate this type of behavior.\n## Chapter 1 Systems of Equations\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNotice that each term on the left is the product of a constant and the first power of an unknown. In the future, we will want to consider equations having many more unknowns, which we will sometimes denote as \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\). This leads to the following definition:\n**Definition 1.1.7**: A linear equation in the unknowns \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) may be written in the form\n\\[a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}x_{n}=b,\\]\nwhere \\(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) are real numbers known as _coefficients_. We also say that \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) are the _variables_ in the equation.\nBy a **system of linear equations** or a **linear system**, we mean a set of linear equations written in a common set of unknowns.\nFor instance,\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}2x_{1}+&1.2x_{2}-4x_{3}=3.7\\\\ -0.1x_{1}&&+&x_{3}=&2\\\\ x_{1}+&x_{2}-&x_{3}=1.4\\end{array}\\]\nis an example of a linear system.\n**Definition 1.1.8**: A **solution** to a linear system is simply a set of numbers \\(x_{1}=s_{1},x_{2}=s_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}=s_{n}\\) that satisfy all the equations in the system.\nFor instance, we earlier considered the linear system\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}-x+y=&1\\\\ -2x+y=-1.\\end{array}\\]\nTo check that \\((x,y)=(2,3)\\) is a solution, we verify that the following equations are true.\n\\[\\begin{array}{rcc}-2+3=&1\\\\ -2(2)+3=-1.\\end{array}\\]\n**Definition 1.1.9**: We call the set of all solutions the **solution space** of the linear system.\n**Activity 1.1.3**: **Linear equations and their solutions..**\n* Which of the following equations are linear?

Please provide a justification for your response. 1. \\[2x+xy-3y^{2}=2.\\]\n2. \\[-2x_{1}+3x_{2}+4x_{3}-x_{5}=0.\\] 3. \\[x=3z-4y.\\]\n2. Consider the system of linear equations: \\[x+y = 3\\] \\[y-z = 2\\] \\[2x+y+z = 4.\\]\n1. Is \\((x,y,z)=(1,2,0)\\) a solution?\n2. Is \\((x,y,z)=(-2,1,0)\\) a solution?\n3. Is \\((x,y,z)=(0,-3,1)\\) a solution?\n4. Can you find a solution in which \\(y=0\\)?\n5. Do you think there are other solutions? Please explain your response.\n#### Summary\nThe point of this section is to build some intuition about the behavior of solutions to linear systems through consideration of some simple examples. We will develop a deeper and more precise understanding of these phenomena in our future explorations.\n* A linear equation is one that may be written in the form \\[a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\\ldots+a_{n}x_{n}=b.\\]\n* A linear system is a set of linear equations and a solution is a set of values assigned to the unknowns that make each equation true.\n* We came to expect that a linear system has either infinitely many solutions, exactly one solution, or no solutions.\n* When we add more equations to a system, the solution space usually seems to become smaller.\n## Chapter 1 Systems of Equations\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n#### Exercises\n* In this section, we saw that errors made in computer arithmetic can produce approximate solutions that are far from the exact solutions. Here is another example in which this can happen. Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1&1\\\\ 1&1.0001\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n* Find the exact solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}2\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n* Suppose that this linear system arises in the midst of a larger computation except that, due to some error in the computation of the right hand side of the equation, our computer thinks we want to solve \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}2\\\\ 2.0001\\end{array}\\right]\\). Find the solution to this equation and compare it to the solution of the equation in the previous part of this exercise.\nNotice how a small change in the right hand side of the equation leads to a large change in the solution. In this case, we say that the matrix \\(A\\) is _ill-conditioned_ because the solutions are extremely sensitive to small changes in the right hand side of the equation.\nThough we will not do so here, it is possible to create a measure of the matrix that tells us when a matrix is ill-conditioned. Regrettably, there is not much we can do to remedy this problem.\n2. In this section, we found the \\(LU\\) factorization of the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1&2&1\\\\ -2&-3&-2\\\\ 3&7&4\\end{array}\\right]\\] in one of the activities, without using partial pivoting. Apply a sequence of row operations, now using partial pivoting, to find an upper triangular matrix \\(U\\) that is row equivalent to \\(A\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n* onesvec(n) that returns the \\(n\\)-dimensional vector whose entries are all \\(1\\)\n* **demean(v) that demeans the vector v,**\n* **vandermonde(x, k) that returns the Vandermonde matrix of degree** \\(k\\) **formed from the components of the vector x, and**\n* **plot_model(xhat, data) that plots the data and the model xhat.**\n**url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidaustinm/' url+='ula_modules/master/orthogonality.py'**\n**sage.repl.load.load(url, globals())**\n**1.** **Suppose we write the linear system**\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}1&-1\\\\ 2&-1\\\\ -1&3\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}-8\\\\ 5\\\\ -10\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n**as** \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\)**.**\n* **Find an orthogonal basis for** \\(\\text{Col}(A)\\)**.**\n* **Find** \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\)**, the orthogonal projection of** \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) **onto** \\(\\text{Col}(A)\\)**.**\n* **Find a solution to the linear system** \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\)**.**\n**2.** **Consider the data in Table** 6.5.9**.**\n**Table 6.5.9** **A dataset with four points.**\n* **Set up the linear system** \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) **that describes the line** \\(b+mx=y\\) **passing through these points.**\n* **Write the normal equations that describe the least-squares approximate solution to** \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\)**.**\n* **Find the least-squares approximate solution** \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\) **and plot the data and the resulting line.**\n* **What is your predicted** \\(y\\)**-value when** \\(x=3.5\\)**?**\n* **Find the coefficient of determination** \\(R^{2}\\)**.**\n* **Consider the four points in Table** 6.5.9**.**\n* Set up a linear system \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) that describes the relationship \\[\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\beta_{2}x_{2}=y.\\]\n* Find the least-squares approximate solution \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\).\n* What is your predicted \\(y\\)-value when \\(x_{1}=2.4\\) and \\(x_{2}=2.9\\)?\n\n\n",

Suppose that we have a basis \\(\\mathcal{B}=\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{m}\\}\\) for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). Explain what we\nFigure 3.3.1: An image stored as a 1440\\(\\times\\)1468 array of pixels along with a close-up of a smaller \\(8\\times 8\\) array.\nmean by the representation \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}\\) of a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in the coordinate system defined by \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). 2.

There are different ways in which we can represent colors, however, depending on whether a computer or a human will be processing the color. We will describe two of these representations, called _color models_, and demonstrate how they are used in the JPEG compression algorithm.\nDigital displays typically create colors by blending together various amounts of red, green, and blue. We can therefore describe a color by putting its constituent amounts of red, green, and blue into a vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}R\\\\ G\\\\ B\\end{array}\\right]\\). The quantities \\(R\\), \\(G\\), and \\(B\\) are each stored with one byte of information so they are integers between 0 and 255. This is called the \\(RGB\\) color model.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nIn the preview activity, we created a new coordinate system for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using linear combinations of a set of two vectors. More generally, the following definition will guide us.\n**Definition 3.2.3** A set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is called a _basis_ for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) if the set of vectors spans \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and is linearly independent.\n**Activity 3.2.2**.: We will look at some examples of bases in this activity.\n1. In the preview activity, we worked with the set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\): \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right].\\] Explain why these vectors form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\).\n2. Consider the set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right]\\] and determine whether they form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\n3. Do the vectors \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 1\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ 0\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 3\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right]\\] form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\)?\n4. Explain why the vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1},\\mathbf{e}_{2},\\mathbf{e}_{3}\\) form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\n5. If a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) forms a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), what can you guarantee about the pivot positions of the matrix \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_{n }\\end{array}\\right]?\\] 6. If the set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) is a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{10}\\), how many vectors must be in the set?\nWe can develop a test to determine if a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) forms a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) by considering the matrix\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe coordinates of the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in the new coordinate system are the weights that we use to create \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\nSince we now have two descriptions of the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we need some notation to keep track of which coordinate system we are using. Because \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ -4\\end{array}\\right]=2\\mathbf{v}_{1}-3\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), we will write\n\\[\\left\\{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ -4\\end{array}\\right]\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -3\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nMore generally, \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}\\) will denote the coordinates of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in the basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\); that is, \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}\\) is the vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}c_{1}\\\\ c_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\) of weights such that\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nFor example, if the coordinates of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in the basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) are\n\\[\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}5\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nthen\n\\[\\mathbf{x}=5\\mathbf{v}_{1}-2\\mathbf{v}_{2}=5\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]-2\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}8\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nand we conclude that\n\\[\\left\\{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}8\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}5\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis demonstrates how we can translate coordinates in the basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) into standard coordinates. Suppose we know the expression of a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in standard coordinates. How can we find its coordinates in the basis \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)? For instance, suppose \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-8\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and that we would like to find\n\\(\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}\\). We can write\n\\[\\left\\{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-8\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}c_{1}\\\\ c_{2}\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich means that\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-8\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\]\nor\n\\[c_{1}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]+c_{2}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-8\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis linear system for the weights defines an augmented matrix\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 1&2\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich means that\n\\[\\left\\{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-8\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\right\\}_{\\mathcal{B}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-6\\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThis example illustrates how a basis in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) provides a new coordinate system for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) and shows how we may translate between this coordinate system and the standard one.\n\n\n",

Let's see how this works in practice.\n**Example 2.6.4** We will consider the function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that rotates a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) in the counterclockwise direction to obtain \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as seen in Figure 2.6.5.\nWe first need to know that \\(T\\) can be represented by a matrix transformation, which means, by Proposition 2.6.3, that we need to verify the linearity properties:\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe next two figures illustrate why these properties hold. For instance, Figure 2.6.6 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) when \\(c\\) is a scalar.

In particular, when \\(n=2\\), the determinant is the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the two columns of the matrix.\n* The determinant satisfies many properties. For instance, \\(\\det(AB)=\\det(A)\\det(B)\\) and the determinant of a triangular matrix is equal to the product of its diagonal entries.\n* These properties helped us compute the determinant of a matrix using row operations. This also led to the important observation that the determinant of a matrix is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible.\n* Finally, we learned how to compute the determinant of a matrix using cofactor expansions, which will be a valuable tool for us in the next chapter.\nWe have seen three ways to compute the determinant: by interpreting the determinant as a signed area or volume; by applying appropriate row operations; and by using a cofactor expansion. It's worth spending a moment to think about the relative merits of these approaches.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n4.

Therefore, every vector is an eigenvector and so \\(E_{-1}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). This eigenspace is two-dimensional.\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nThis leads to \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\). In the same way, we find that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\) so that the matrix \\(A\\) is\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[Q=\\begin{bmatrix}4/5&3/5\\\\ 3/5&-4/5\\end{bmatrix},\\hskip 28.452756ptD=\\begin{bmatrix}25&0\\\\ 0&-50\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nand note that \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\).\nNotice also that, as expected, \\(A\\) is symmetric; that is, \\(A=A^{T}\\).\n**Example 7.1.7** If \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{bmatrix}\\), then there is an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=-1\\). Using these eigenvectors, we form the orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) consisting of eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix \\(D\\), where\n\\[Q=\\begin{bmatrix}1/\\sqrt{2}&-1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{bmatrix},\\hskip 28.452756ptD=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nThen we have \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\).\nNotice that the matrix transformation represented by \\(Q\\) is a \\(45^{\\circ}\\) rotation while that represented by \\(Q^{T}=Q^{-1}\\) is a \\(-45^{\\circ}\\) rotation. Therefore, if we multiply a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(A\\), we can\ndecompose the multiplication as\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=Q(D(Q^{T}\\mathbf{x})).\\]\nThat is, we first rotate \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(-45^{\\circ}\\), then apply the diagonal matrix \\(D\\), which stretches and reflects, and finally rotate by \\(45^{\\circ}\\). We may visualize this factorization as in Figure 7.1.8.\nIn fact, a similar picture holds any time the matrix \\(A\\) is orthogonally diagonalizable.\nWe have seen that a matrix that is orthogonally diagonalizable must be symmetric. In fact, it turns out that any symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable. We record this fact in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 7.1.9**: **The Spectral Theorem.** _The matrix \\(A\\) is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if \\(A\\) is symmetric._\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* If you multiply the eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that you found by 2, do you still have an eigenvector? If so, what is the associated eigenvalue?\n* Are you able to find another eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that is not a scalar multiple of the first one that you found? If so, what is the eigenvector and what is the associated eigenvalue?\n* Now consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\). Use the diagram to describe any eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues.\n* Finally, consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\). Use the diagram to describe any eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues. What geometric transformation does this matrix perform on vectors? How does this explain the presence of any eigenvectors?\nLet's consider the ideas we saw in the activity in some more depth. To be an eigenvector of \\(A\\), the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) must satisfy \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\) for some scalar \\(\\lambda\\). This means that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{v}\\) are scalar multiples of each other so they must lie on the same line.\nFigure 4.1.3: A geometric interpretation of the eigenvalue-eigenvector condition \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\) .\nConsider now the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). On the left of Figure 4.1.4, we see that \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\) is not an eigenvector of \\(A\\) since the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{v}\\) do not lie on the same line. On the right, however, we see that \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) is an eigenvector. In fact, \\(A\\mathbf{v}\\) is obtained from \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by stretching \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by a factor of \\(3\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=3\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThe preview activity asks us to compare the matrix transformations defined by two matrices, a diagonal matrix \\(D\\) and a matrix \\(A\\) whose eigenvectors are given to us. The transformation defined by \\(D\\) stretches horizontally by a factor of \\(3\\) and reflects in the horizontal axis, as shown in Figure 7.1.2\nFigure 7.1.1: Use these plots to sketch the vectors requested in the preview activity.\n**Figure 7.1.2** The matrix transformation defined by \\(D\\).\nBy contrast, the transformation defined by \\(A\\) stretches the plane by a factor of 3 in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and reflects in the line defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), as seen in Figure 7.1.3.\n**Figure 7.1.3** The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\).\nIn this way, we see that the matrix transformations defined by these two matrices are equivalent after a \\(45^{\\circ}\\) rotation. This notion of equivalence is what we called _similarity_ in Section 4.3. There we considered a square \\(m\\times m\\) matrix \\(A\\) that provided enough eigenvectors to form a basis of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\). For example, suppose we can construct a basis for \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\) using eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{m}\\) having associated eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{m}\\). Forming the matrices,\n\\[P=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_{m}\\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad D=\\begin{bmatrix}\\lambda_{1}&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\lambda_{2}&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&\\ldots&\\lambda_{m}\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nenables us to write \\(A=PDP^{-1}\\). This is what it means for \\(A\\) to be diagonalizable.\nFor the example in the preview activity, we are led to form\n\\[P=\\begin{bmatrix}1&-1\\\\ 1&1\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\n",

Notice that this matrix is not triangular so performing a row interchange will disrupt the structure of the \\(LU\\) factorization we seek. Without giving the details, we simply note that linear algebra software packages provide a matrix \\(P\\) that describes how the rows are permuted in the Gaussian elimination\nprocess. In particular, we will write \\(PA=LU\\), where \\(P\\) is a permutation matrix, \\(L\\) is lower triangular, and \\(U\\) is upper triangular.\nTherefore, to solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we first multiply both sides by \\(P\\) to obtain\n\\[PA\\mathbf{x}=LU\\mathbf{x}=P\\mathbf{b}.\\]\nThat is, we multiply \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) by \\(P\\) and then find \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) using the factorization: \\(L\\mathbf{c}=P\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(U\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}\\).\n**Activity 5.1.4**.: Sage will create \\(LU\\) factorizations; once we have a matrix \\(\\mathsf{A}\\), we write \\(\\mathsf{P}\\), \\(\\mathsf{L}\\), \\(\\mathsf{U}=\\mathsf{A}.\\mathsf{LU}()\\) to obtain the matrices \\(P\\), \\(L\\), and \\(U\\) such that \\(PA=LU\\).\n1.

We expand the product polynomial into \\(mn\\) terms, and collect those terms associated with \\(x^{k-1}\\). These terms have the form \\(a_{i}b_{j}x^{i+j-2}\\), for \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) that satisfy \\(i+j-2=k-1\\), _i.e._, \\(i+j=k-1\\). It follows that \\(c_{k}=\\sum_{i+j=k+1}a_{i}b_{j}\\), which agrees with the convolution formula (7.2).\nProperties of convolution.Convolution is symmetric: We have \\(a*b=b*a\\). It is also associative: We have \\((a*b)*c=a*(b*c)\\), so we can write both as \\(a*b*c\\). Another property is that \\(a*b=0\\) implies that either \\(a=0\\) or \\(b=0\\). These properties follow from the polynomial coefficient property above, and can also be directly shown. As an example, let us show that \\(a*b=b*a\\). Suppose \\(p\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(a\\), and \\(q\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(b\\). The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients. The coefficients of \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are \\(a*b\\) and the coefficients of \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are \\(b*a\\). These must be the same.\nA basic property is that for fixed \\(a\\), the convolution \\(a*b\\) is a linear function of \\(b\\); and for fixed \\(b\\), it is a linear function of \\(a\\). This means we can express \\(a*b\\) as a matrix-vector product:\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n#### Summary\nWe returned to Gaussian elimination, which we have used as a primary tool for finding solutions to linear systems, and explored its practicality, both in terms of numerical accuracy and computational effort.\n* We saw that the accuracy of computations implemented on a computer could be improved using _partial pivoting_, a technique that performs row interchanges so that the entry in a pivot position has the largest possible magnitude.\n* Beginning with a matrix \\(A\\), we used the Gaussian elimination algorithm to write \\(PA=LU\\), where \\(P\\) is a permutation matrix, \\(L\\) is lower triangular, and \\(U\\) is upper triangular.\n* Finding this factorization involves roughly as much work as performing Gaussian elimination. However, once we have the factorization, we are able to quickly solve equations of the form \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) by first solving \\(L\\mathbf{c}=P\\mathbf{b}\\) and then \\(U\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}\\).\n#### Exercises\n* In this section, we saw that errors made in computer arithmetic can produce approximate solutions that are far from the exact solutions.

Find the solution to this equation and compare it to the solution of the equation in the previous part of this exercise.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* Suppose that \\(A\\) is a matrix with linearly independent columns and having the factorization \\(A=QR\\).

To get started, let's look at some familiar examples.\n**Preview Activity 3.1.1.**\n* Explain how you would solve the equation \\(3x=5\\) using multiplication rather than division.\n* Find the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A\\) that rotates vectors counterclockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\).\n* Find the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(B\\) that rotates vectors _clockwise_ by \\(90^{\\circ}\\).\n* What do you expect the product \\(AB\\) to be? Explain the reasoning behind your expectation and then compute \\(AB\\) to verify it.\n* Solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right]\\) using Gaussian elimination.\n* Explain why your solution may also be found by computing \\(\\mathbf{x}=B\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n#### Invertible matrices\nThe preview activity began with a familiar type of equation, \\(3x=5\\), and asked for a strategy to solve it. One possible response is to divide both sides by \\(3\\). Instead, let's rephrase this as multiplying by \\(3^{-1}=\\frac{1}{3}\\), the multiplicative inverse of \\(3\\).\nNow that we are interested in solving equations of the form \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we might try to find a similar approach. Is there a matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) that plays the role of the multiplicative inverse of \\(A\\)? Of course, the real number \\(0\\) does not have a multiplicative inverse so we probably shouldn't expect every matrix to have a multiplicative inverse. We will see, however, that many do.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. Use your result from Exercise 7.4.5.1 to find a singular value decomposition of \\(B=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\).\n2. What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(B)\\)? Determine a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(B)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Col}(B)^{\\perp}\\).\n3. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-3\\\\ 4\\\\ 7\\end{array}\\right]\\). Use the bases you found in the previous part of this\nexercise to write \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}+\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\), where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(B)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(B)^{\\perp}\\). 4. Find the least-squares approximate solution to the equation \\(B\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\).\n7.

What condition on the singular values must hold for \\(A\\) to be invertible? 3. How are the singular values of \\(A\\) and the singular values of \\(A^{-1}\\) related to one another? 4. How are the right and left singular vectors of \\(A\\) related to the right and left singular vectors of \\(A^{-1}\\)?\n8. 1. If \\(Q\\) is an orthogonal matrix, remember that \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\). Explain why \\(\\det Q=\\pm 1\\). 2. If \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) is a singular value decomposition of a square matrix \\(A\\), explain why \\(|\\det A|\\) is the product of the singular values of \\(A\\). 3.

What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial.

Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-\\frac{1}{2}&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\).

Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is the geometric effect of the matrix transformation defined by this matrix?\n3. Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\).

Compute the scalar multiple\n* Find the sum \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-3\\\\ 1&-2\\\\ 3&4\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}4&-1\\\\ -2&2\\\\ 1&1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n* Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two matrices. What do we need to know about their shapes before we can form the sum \\(A+B\\)?\n* The matrix \\(I_{n}\\), which we call the _identity_ matrix, is the \\(n\\times n\\) matrix whose entries are zero except for the diagonal entries, all of which are \\(1\\). For instance, \\[I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right].\\] If we can form the sum \\(A+I_{n}\\), what must be true about the matrix \\(A\\)?\n* Find the matrix \\(A-2I_{3}\\) where \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&2&-2\\\\ 2&-3&3\\\\ -2&3&4\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nAs this preview activity shows, the operations of scalar multiplication and addition of matrices are natural extensions of their vector counterparts. Some care, however, is required when adding matrices. Since we need the same number of vectors to add and since those vectors must be of the same dimension, two matrices must have the same shape if we wish to form their sum.\n#### Matrix-vector multiplication and linear combinations\nA more important operation will be matrix multiplication as it allows us to compactly express linear systems. We now introduce the product of a matrix and a vector with an example.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThis explains Proposition 3.4.10 and so we know that \\(A\\) is invertible if and only if \\(\\det(A)\\neq 0\\). Finally, notice that if \\(A\\) is invertible, we have \\(A^{-1}A=I\\), which tells us that\n\\[\\det(A^{-1}A)=\\det(A^{-1})\\det(A)=1.\\]\nTherefore, \\(\\det(A^{-1})=1/\\det(A)\\).\n**Proposition 3.4.12**_If \\(A\\) is an invertible matrix, then \\(\\det(A^{-1})=1/\\det(A)\\)._\n#### Cofactor expansions\nWe now have a technique for computing the determinant of a matrix using row operations. There is another way to compute determinants, using what are called _cofactor expansions_, that will be important for us in the next chapter. We will describe this method here.\nTo begin, the determinant of a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix is\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\ c&d\\end{array}\\right]=ad-bc.\\]\nWith a little bit of work, it can be shown that this number is the same as the signed area of the parallelogram we introduced earlier.\nUsing a cofactor expansion to find the determinant of a more general \\(n\\times n\\) matrix is a little more work so we will demonstrate it with an example.\n**Example 3.4.13** We illustrate how to use a cofactor expansion to find the determinant of \\(A\\) where\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1&-1&2\\\\ -2&2&-6\\\\ 3&-1&10\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTo begin, we choose one row or column. It doesn't matter which we choose because the result will be the same in any case. Here, we choose the second row\n\n\n",

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(A\\) provide the key that helps us understand how the vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) evolve and that enables us to make long-range predictions.\nLet's look at the specific example in the previous activity more carefully.

We call a basis orthogonal if the basis vectors are orthogonal to one another. However, a matrix is orthogonal if the columns are orthogonal to one another and have unit length. It pays to keep this in mind when reading statements about orthogonal bases and orthogonal matrices. In the meantime, we record the following proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.23**_An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is invertible and its inverse \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\)._\n#### Summary\nThis section introduced orthogonal sets and the projection formula that allows us to project vectors orthogonally onto a subspace.\n* Given an orthogonal set \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_{n}\\) that spans an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector in \\(W\\) closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and may be written as \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{1}}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{1}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{1}+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{2}}{\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{2}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\\mathbf{w}_{n} \\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{n}.\\]\n* If \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) is an orthonormal basis of \\(W\\) and \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\), then the matrix \\(P=QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\).\n* If the columns of \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal basis for an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), then \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\).\n* An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is a square matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis. In this case, \\(QQ^{T}=Q^{T}Q=I\\) so that \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n_where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W^{\\perp}\\)._\nLet's summarize what we've found. If \\(Q\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) form an orthonormal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then\n* \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix, because this product computes the dot products between the columns of \\(Q\\).\n* \\(QQ^{T}\\) is the matrix the projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\).\nAs we've said before, matrix multiplication depends on the order in which we multiply the matrices, and we see this clearly here.\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}14\\\\ -6\\\\ 8\\\\ 2\\\\ -6\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}5\\\\ -3\\\\ 4\\\\ 3\\\\ -7\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\\\ 0\\\\ -2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n1.

We construct a function like this by choosing a number \\(m\\); when given an input \\(x\\), the output \\(g(x)=mx\\) is formed by multiplying \\(x\\) by \\(m\\).\nIn this section, we will consider functions whose inputs are vectors and whose outputs are vectors defined through matrix-vector multiplication. That is, if \\(A\\) is a matrix and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a vector, the function \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) forms the product \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) as its output. Such a function is called a matrix transformation.\n**Definition 2.5.3** The **matrix transformation** associated to the matrix \\(A\\) is the function that assigns to the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) the vector \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\); that is, \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\).\n**Example 2.5.4** The matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}3&-2\\\\ 1&2\\\\ 0&3\\end{bmatrix}\\) defines a matrix transformation \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) in the following way:\n\\[T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=\\begin{bmatrix}3&-2\\\\ 1&2\\\\ 0&3\\end{bmatrix}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3x_{1}-2x_{2}\\\\ x_{1}+2x_{2}\\\\ 3x_{2}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nNotice that the input to \\(T\\) is a two-dimensional vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\) and the output is a three-dimensional vector.\nFigure 2.5.2: Graphs of the function \\(g(x)=2x\\) and \\(h(x)=-\\frac{1}{3}x\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe will now check that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) using the linearity of \\(T\\):\n\\[T(\\mathbf{x})=T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=T(x_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+ x_{n}\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=x_{1}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})+x_{2}T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})+\\ldots+x_{n}T(\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=x_{1}A\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}A\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+x_{n}A\\mathbf{e}_{n}\\]\n\\[=A(x_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+x_{n}\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=A\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\\[=A\\mathbf{x}\\]\nThe result is the following proposition.\n**Proposition 2.6.3**_The function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is a matrix transformation where \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) for some \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) if and only if_\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\n_In this case, \\(A\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{j})\\); that is,_\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots&T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSaid simply, this proposition means says that if have a function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and can verify the two linearity properties stated in the proposition, then we know that \\(T\\) is a matrix transformation. Let's see how this works in practice.\n**Example 2.6.4** We will consider the function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that rotates a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) in the counterclockwise direction to obtain \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as seen in Figure 2.6.5.\nWe first need to know that \\(T\\) can be represented by a matrix transformation, which means, by Proposition 2.6.3, that we need to verify the linearity properties:\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe next two figures illustrate why these properties hold. For instance, Figure 2.6.6 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) when \\(c\\) is a scalar. In particular, scaling a vector and then rotating it is the same as rotating and then scaling it, which means that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n.

A common trading strategy maintains constant investment weights given by the \\(n\\)-vector \\(w\\) over the \\(T\\) periods. For example, \\(w_{4}=0.15\\) means that \\(15\\%\\) of the total portfolio value is held in asset 4. (Short positions are denoted by negative entries in \\(w\\).) Then \\(Rw\\), which is a \\(T\\)-vector, is the time series of the portfolio returns over the periods \\(1,\\ldots,T\\). As an example, consider a portfolio of the 4 assets in table 6.1, with weights \\(w=(0.4,0.3,-0.2,0.5)\\). The product \\(Rw=(0.00213,-0.00201,0.00241)\\) gives the portfolio returns over the three periods in the example.\n* _Polynomial evaluation at multiple points._ Suppose the entries of the \\(n\\)-vector \\(c\\) are the coefficients of a polynomial \\(p\\) of degree \\(n-1\\) or less: \\[p(t)=c_{1}+c_{2}t+\\cdots+c_{n-1}t^{n-2}+c_{n}t^{n-1}.\\] Let \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\) be \\(m\\) numbers, and define the \\(m\\)-vector \\(y\\) as \\(y_{i}=p(t_{i})\\).

The matrix \\(A\\) in (6.7) comes up often, and is called a _Vandermonde matrix_ (of degree \\(n-1\\), at the points \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\)), named for the mathematician Alexandre-Theophile Vandermonde.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nCoefficients of linear combinations.Let \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) denote the columns of \\(A\\).

So solving \\(Ax=b\\) is the same as finding coefficients that express \\(b\\) as a linear combination of the vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\).\nPolynomial interpolation.We seek a polynomial \\(p\\) of degree at most \\(n-1\\) that interpolates a set of \\(m\\) given points \\((t_{i},y_{i})\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,m\\).

They are typically integers, but can be scaled arbitrarily; we could double all of these numbers, for example, and we still have the same reaction.

What do we need to know about their shapes before we can form the sum \\(A+B\\)?\n* The matrix \\(I_{n}\\), which we call the _identity_ matrix, is the \\(n\\times n\\) matrix whose entries are zero except for the diagonal entries, all of which are \\(1\\). For instance, \\[I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right].\\] If we can form the sum \\(A+I_{n}\\), what must be true about the matrix \\(A\\)?\n* Find the matrix \\(A-2I_{3}\\) where \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&2&-2\\\\ 2&-3&3\\\\ -2&3&4\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nAs this preview activity shows, the operations of scalar multiplication and addition of matrices are natural extensions of their vector counterparts. Some care, however, is required when adding matrices. Since we need the same number of vectors to add and since those vectors must be of the same dimension, two matrices must have the same shape if we wish to form their sum.\n#### Matrix-vector multiplication and linear combinations\nA more important operation will be matrix multiplication as it allows us to compactly express linear systems. We now introduce the product of a matrix and a vector with an example.\n\n\n",

Just as for solving linear equations, or (unconstrained) least squares problems, there are methods that exploit the sparsity in \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) to solve constrained least squares problems more efficiently than the generic algorithms 16.1\nor 16.2. The simplest such methods follow these basic algorithms, replacing the QR factorizations with sparse QR factorizations (see page 190).\nOne potential problem with forming the KKT matrix as in algorithm 16.1 is that the Gram matrix \\(A^{T}A\\) can be far less sparse than the matrix \\(A\\). This problem can be avoided using a trick analogous to the one used on page 232 to solve sparse (unconstrained) least squares problems. We form the square set of \\(m+n+p\\) linear equations\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0&A^{T}&C^{T}\\\\ A&-(1/2)I&0\\\\ C&0&0\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{x}\\\\ \\hat{y}\\\\ \\hat{z}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ b\\\\ d\\end{array}\\right].\\] (16.11)\nIf \\((\\hat{x},\\hat{y},\\hat{z})\\) satisfies these equations, it is easy to see that \\((\\hat{x},\\hat{z})\\) satisfies the KKT equations (16.4); conversely, if \\((\\hat{x},\\hat{z})\\) satisfies the KKT equations (16.4), \\((\\hat{x},\\hat{y},\\hat{z})\\) satisfies the equations above, with \\(\\hat{y}=2(A\\hat{x}-b)\\). Provided \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are sparse, the coefficient matrix above is sparse, and any method for solving a sparse system of linear equations can be used to solve it.\nSolution of least norm problem.Here we specialize the solution of the general constrained least squares problem (16.1) given above to the special case of the least norm problem (16.2).\nWe start with the conditions (16.5).

For each of these, compute the solution \\(x=A^{-1}b\\) (for example using the backslash operator, if the software you are using supports it), and verify that \\(Ax-b\\) is (very) small. Report the time it takes to solve each of these three sets of linear equations, and for each one work out the implied speed of your processor in Gflop/s, based on the \\(2n^{3}\\) complexity of solving equations using the QR factorization.\n* _Solving multiple linear equations efficiently._ Suppose the \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is invertible. We can solve the system of linear equations \\(Ax=b\\) in around \\(2n^{3}\\) flops using algorithm 11.2. Once we have done that (specifically, computed the QR factorization of \\(A\\)), we can solve an additional set of linear equations with same matrix but different right-hand side, \\(Ay=c\\), in around \\(3n^{2}\\) additional flops. Assuming we have solved both of these sets of equations, suppose we want to solve \\(Az=d\\), where \\(d=\\alpha b+\\beta c\\) is a linear combination of \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). (We are given the coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).) Suggest a method for doing this that is even faster than re-using the QR factorization of \\(A\\). Your method should have a complexity that is _linear_ in \\(n\\). Give rough estimates for the time needed to solve \\(Ax=b\\), \\(Ay=c\\), and \\(Az=d\\) (using your method) for \\(n=3000\\) on a computer capable of carrying out 1 Gflop/s.\n\n\n",

This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBefore exploring this connection further, we will introduce Sage as a tool for automating the construction of singular value decompositions. One new feature is that we need to declare our matrix to consist of floating point entries. We do this by including RDF inside the matrix definition, as illustrated in the following cell.\nA = matrix(RDF, 3, 2, [1,0,-1,1,1,1]) U, Sigma, V = A.SVD() print(U) print('-------') print(Sigma) print('-------') print(V)\n**Activity 7.5.2**.: Consider the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) where\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\ 1&1\\\\ 1&2\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 3\\\\ 6\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n1. Find a singular value decomposition for \\(A\\) using the Sage cell below. What are singular values of \\(A\\)?\n2. What is \\(r\\), the rank of \\(A\\)? How can we identify an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n3. Form the reduced singular value decomposition \\(U_{r}\\Sigma_{r}V_{r}^{T}\\) by constructing: the matrix \\(U_{r}\\), consisting of the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\); the matrix \\(V_{r}\\), consisting of the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(V\\); and \\(\\Sigma_{r}\\), a square \\(r\\times r\\) diagonal matrix. Verify that \\(A=U_{r}\\Sigma_{r}V_{r}^{T}\\). You may find it convenient to remember that if B is a matrix defined in Sage, then B.matrix_from_columns( list ) and B.matrix_from_rows( list ) can be used to extract columns or rows from B. For instance, B.matrix_from_rows([0,1,2]) provides a matrix formed from the first three rows of B.\n4. How does the reduced singular value decomposition provide a matrix whose columns are an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n5.

What is the product \\(V_{r}^{T}V_{r}\\) and why does it have this form?\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nMoreover, the reduced row echelon form shows that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are linearly independent, which implies that they form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This means that \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is a 2-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{3}\\), which is a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\), having basis\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -4\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn general, a column without a pivot position can be written as a linear combination of the columns that have pivot positions. This means that a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) will always be given by the columns of \\(A\\) having pivot positions. This leads us to the following definition and proposition.\n**Definition 3.5.8** The **rank** of a matrix \\(A\\) is the number of pivot positions in \\(A\\) and is denoted by \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\).\n**Proposition 3.5.9**_If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, then \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) whose dimension equals \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\). The columns of \\(A\\) that contain pivot positions form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)._\nFor example, the rank of the matrix \\(A\\) in Example 3.5.7 is two because there are two pivot positions. A basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is given by the first two columns of \\(A\\) since those columns have pivot positions.\nAs a note of caution, we determine the pivot positions by looking at the reduced row echelon form of \\(A\\). However, we form a basis of \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) from the columns of \\(A\\) rather than the columns of the reduced row echelon matrix.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n#### Exercises\n1.

The matrix above has 3 rows and 4 columns, so its size is \\(3\\times 4\\). A matrix of size \\(m\\times n\\) is called an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix.\nThe _elements_ (or _entries_ or _coefficients_) of a matrix are the values in the array. The \\(i,j\\) element is the value in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column, denoted by double subscripts: the \\(i,j\\) element of a matrix \\(A\\) is denoted \\(A_{ij}\\) (or \\(A_{i,j}\\), when \\(i\\) or \\(j\\) is more than one digit or character). The positive integers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are called the (row and column) _indices_. If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, then the row index \\(i\\) runs from 1 to \\(m\\) and the column index \\(j\\) runs from 1 to \\(n\\). Row indices go from top to bottom, so row 1 is the top row and row \\(m\\) is the bottom row. Column indices go from left to right, so column 1 is the left column and column \\(n\\) is the right column.\nIf the matrix above is \\(B\\), then we have \\(B_{13}=-2.3\\), \\(B_{32}=-1\\). The row index of the bottom left element (which has value 4.1) is 3; its column index is 1.\n\n\n",

Once we know \\(w\\), we can find \\(\\hat{x}\\) from (16.9). The method is summarized in the following algorithm.\n**Algorithm 16.2** Constrained least squares via QR factorization\nIn the unconstrained case (when \\(p=0\\)), step 1 reduces to computing the QR factorization of \\(A\\), steps 2 and 3 are not needed, and step 4 reduces to solving \\(R\\hat{x}=Q_{1}^{T}b\\). This is the same as algorithm 12.1 for solving (unconstrained) least squares problems.\nWe now give a complexity analysis. Step 1 involves the QR factorizations of an \\((m+p)\\times n\\) and an \\(n\\times p\\) matrix, which costs \\(2(m+p)n^{2}+2np^{2}\\) flops. Step 2 requires \\(p^{2}\\) flops. In step 3, we first evaluate \\(Q_{1}^{T}b\\) (\\(2mn\\) flops), multiply the result by \\(\\tilde{Q}^{T}\\) (\\(2pn\\) flops), and then solve for \\(w\\) using forward substitution (\\(p^{2}\\) flops). Step 4 requires \\(2mn+2pn\\) flops to form the right-hand side, and \\(n^{2}\\) flops to compute \\(\\hat{x}\\) via back substitution. The costs of steps 2, 3, and 4 are quadratic in the dimensions, and so are negligible compared to the cost of step 1, so our final complexity is\n\\[2(m+p)n^{2}+2np^{2}\\]\nflops.

What is rank(B)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values.

What do you notice about the error \\(A-A_{k}\\) as \\(k\\) increases?\nIn this activity, the approximating matrix \\(A_{k}\\) has rank \\(k\\) because its singular value decomposition has \\(k\\) nonzero singular values. We then saw how the difference between \\(A\\) and the approximations \\(A_{k}\\) decreases as \\(k\\) increases, which means that the sequence \\(A_{k}\\) forms better approximations as \\(k\\) increases.\nAnother way to represent \\(A_{k}\\) is with a reduced singular value decomposition so that \\(A_{k}=U_{k}\\Sigma_{k}V_{k}^{T}\\) where\n\\[U_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{u}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\\Sigma_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{k}\\end{bmatrix},\\quad V_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1 }&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nNotice that the rank \\(1\\) matrix \\(A_{1}\\) then has the form \\(A_{1}=\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}= \\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\) and that we can similarly write:\n\\[A\\approx A_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\]\n\\[A\\approx A_{2}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}\\] \\[A\\approx A_{3}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_ {2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}\\] \\[\\qquad\\vdots\\] \\[A=A_{r}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}+ \\ldots+\\sigma_{r}\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\mathbf{v}_{r}^{T}.\\]\nGiven two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the matrix \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)\\(\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\) is called the _outer product_ of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). (The dot product \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{u}^{T}\\mathbf{v}\\) is sometimes called the _inner product_.) An outer product will always be a rank 1 matrix so we see above how \\(A_{k}\\) is obtained by adding together \\(k\\) rank \\(1\\) matrices, each of which gets us one step closer to the original matrix \\(A\\).\n#### Principal component analysis\nIn Section 7.3, we explored principal component analysis as a technique to reduce the dimension of a dataset. In particular, we constructed the covariance matrix \\(C\\) from a demeaned data matrix and saw that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(C\\) tell us about the variance of the dataset in different directions. We referred to the eigenvectors of \\(C\\) as _principal components_ and found that projecting the data onto a subspace defined by the first few principal components frequently gave us a way to visualize the dataset. As we added more principal components, we retained more information about the original dataset. This feels similar to the rank \\(k\\) approximations we have just seen so let's explore the connection.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\).

In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\).

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\).

What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\).

This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n\n\n",

Our definition of an invertible matrix requires that \\(A\\) be a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. Let's examine what happens when \\(A\\) is not square.

This understanding of symmetric matrices will enable us to form singular value decompositions later in the chapter. We'll also begin studying variance in this section as it provides an important context that motivates some of our later work.\nTo begin, remember that if \\(A\\) is a square matrix, we say that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) if \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). In other words, for these special vectors, the operation of matrix multiplication simplifies to scalar multiplication.\n**Preview Activity 7.1.1.** This preview activity reminds us how a basis of eigenvectors can be used to relate a square matrix to a diagonal one.\n* Suppose that \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\) and that \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). 1.

Using the fact that \\(AB\\mathbf{x}=A(B\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent for every \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), explain why every equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent. 3. Explain why \\(A\\) must be invertible.\nWe defined an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix to be invertible if there is a matrix \\(B\\) such that \\(AB=I_{n}\\). In this exercise, we will explain why it is also true that \\(BA=I\\), which is the statement of Proposition 3.1.6. This means that, if \\(B=A^{-1}\\), then \\(A=B^{-1}\\).\n1.

What is |A|?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane. The function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is defined as\n\\[\\hat{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}p(x)&x\\leq a\\\\ q(x)&x>a,\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nwith \\(a\\) given, and \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) polynomials of degree three or less,\n\\[p(x)=\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x+\\theta_{3}x^{2}+\\theta_{4}x^{3},\\qquad q(x)=\\theta _{5}+\\theta_{6}x+\\theta_{7}x^{2}+\\theta_{8}x^{3}.\\]\nWe also impose the condition that \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\), so that \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is continuous and has a continuous first derivative at \\(x=a\\). Suppose the \\(N\\) data\nFigure 16.1: Least squares fit of two cubic polynomials to 140 points, with continuity constraints \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\).\npoints \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) are numbered so that \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{M}\\leq a\\) and \\(x_{M+1},\\ldots,x_{N}>a\\). The sum of squares of the prediction errors is\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[A^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr}-0.5784&1.9841&-2.1368&0.7310\\\\ 0.3470&0.1984&-1.4957&0.9503\\\\ 0.1388&-1.8651&1.6239&0.1023\\\\ -0.0370&0.3492&0.7521&-0.0643\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n(to 4 decimal places). This is illustrated in figure 11.1, which shows the two cubic polynomials that interpolate the two sets of points shown as filled circles and squares, respectively.\nThe columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are interesting: They give the coefficients of a polynomial that evaluates to 0 at three of the points, and 1 at the other\nfirst column of \\(A^{-1}\\), which is \\(A^{-1}e_{1}\\), gives the coefficients of the polynomial that has value 1 at \\(-1.1\\), and value 0 at \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, and 0.8. The four polynomials with coefficients given by the columns of \\(A^{-1}\\) are called the _Lagrange polynomials_ associated with the points \\(-1.1\\), \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, 0.8. These are plotted in figure 11.2. (The Lagrange polynomials are named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, whose name will re-appear in several other contexts.)\nThe rows of \\(A^{-1}\\) are also interesting: The \\(i\\)th row shows how the values \\(b_{1}\\), ..., \\(b_{4}\\), the polynomial values at the points \\(-1.1\\), \\(-0.4\\), 0.2, 0.8, map into the \\(i\\)th coefficient of the polynomial, \\(c_{i}\\). For example, we see that the coefficient \\(c_{4}\\) is not very sensitive to the value of \\(b_{1}\\) (since \\((A^{-1})_{41}\\) is small). We can also see that for each increase of one in \\(b_{4}\\), the coefficient \\(c_{2}\\) increases by around 0.95.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* _Portfolio return time series._ Suppose that \\(R\\) is a \\(T\\times n\\) asset return matrix, that gives the returns of \\(n\\) assets over \\(T\\) periods. A common trading strategy maintains constant investment weights given by the \\(n\\)-vector \\(w\\) over the \\(T\\) periods. For example, \\(w_{4}=0.15\\) means that \\(15\\%\\) of the total portfolio value is held in asset 4. (Short positions are denoted by negative entries in \\(w\\).) Then \\(Rw\\), which is a \\(T\\)-vector, is the time series of the portfolio returns over the periods \\(1,\\ldots,T\\). As an example, consider a portfolio of the 4 assets in table 6.1, with weights \\(w=(0.4,0.3,-0.2,0.5)\\). The product \\(Rw=(0.00213,-0.00201,0.00241)\\) gives the portfolio returns over the three periods in the example.\n* _Polynomial evaluation at multiple points._ Suppose the entries of the \\(n\\)-vector \\(c\\) are the coefficients of a polynomial \\(p\\) of degree \\(n-1\\) or less: \\[p(t)=c_{1}+c_{2}t+\\cdots+c_{n-1}t^{n-2}+c_{n}t^{n-1}.\\] Let \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\) be \\(m\\) numbers, and define the \\(m\\)-vector \\(y\\) as \\(y_{i}=p(t_{i})\\). Then we have \\(y=Ac\\), where \\(A\\) is the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&t_{1}&\\cdots&t_{1}^{n-2}&t_{1}^{n-1}\\\\ 1&t_{2}&\\cdots&t_{2}^{n-2}&t_{2}^{n-1}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 1&t_{m}&\\cdots&t_{m}^{n-2}&t_{m}^{n-1}\\end{array}\\right].\\] (6.7)\nSo multiplying a vector \\(c\\) by the matrix \\(A\\) is the same as evaluating a polynomial with coefficients \\(c\\) at \\(m\\) points. The matrix \\(A\\) in (6.7) comes up often, and is called a _Vandermonde matrix_ (of degree \\(n-1\\), at the points \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\)), named for the mathematician Alexandre-Theophile Vandermonde.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nIt is useful to identify the symbols appearing in these two equations. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left of the left-hand equation is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right of the left-hand equation denotes matrix addition. On the left side of the right-hand equation we see scalar-scalar multiplication (\\(\\alpha\\beta\\)) and scalar-matrix multiplication; on the right we see two cases of scalar-matrix multiplication.\nFinally, we mention that scalar-matrix multiplication has higher precedence than matrix addition, which means that we should carry out multiplication before addition (when there are no parentheses to fix the order). So the right-hand side of the left equation above is to be interpreted as \\((\\beta A)+(\\gamma A)\\).\n#### Matrix norm\nThe norm of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), denoted \\(\\|A\\|\\), is the squareroot of the sum of the squares of its entries,\n\\[\\|A\\|=\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{ij}^{2}}.\\] (6.3)\nThis agrees with our definition for vectors when \\(A\\) is a vector, _i.e._, \\(n=1\\). The norm of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix is the norm of an \\(mn\\)-vector formed from the entries of the matrix (in any order). Like the vector norm, the matrix norm is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of a matrix. In some applications it is more natural to use the RMS values of the matrix entries, \\(\\|A\\|/\\sqrt{mn}\\), as a measure of matrix size. The RMS value of the matrix entries tells us the typical size of the entries, independent of the matrix dimensions.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Activity 7.1.3**.: Each of the following matrices is symmetric so the Spectral Theorem tells us that each is orthogonally diagonalizable. The point of this activity is to find an orthogonal diagonalization for each matrix.\nTo begin, find a basis for each eigenspace. Use this basis to find an orthogonal basis for each eigenspace and put these bases together to find an orthogonal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. Use this basis to write an orthogonal diagonalization of the matrix.\n1. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0&2\\\\ 2&3\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n2. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}4&-2&14\\\\ -2&19&-16\\\\ 14&-16&13\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n3. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}5&4&2\\\\ 4&5&2\\\\ 2&2&2\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n4. Consider the matrix \\(A=B^{T}B\\) where \\(B=\\begin{bmatrix}0&1&2\\\\ 2&0&1\\end{bmatrix}\\). Explain how we know that \\(A\\) is symmetric and then find an orthogonal diagonalization of \\(A\\).\nAs the examples in Activity 7.1.3 illustrate, the Spectral Theorem implies a number of things. Namely, if \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(m\\times m\\) matrix, then\n* the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are real.\n* there is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) consisting of eigenvectors.\n* two eigenvectors that are associated to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\nWe won't justify the first two facts here since that would take us rather far afield. However, it will be helpful to explain the third fact. To begin, notice the following:\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=\\mathbf{v}^{T}A\\mathbf{w}=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})^{T} \\mathbf{w}=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\nThis is a useful fact that we'll employ quite a bit in the future so let's summarize it in the following proposition.\n**Proposition 7.1.10**_For any matrix \\(A\\), we have_\n\n\n",

We will now develop a more algebraic understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we will find an algebraic method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.\n**Preview Activity 4.2.1.** Let's begin by reviewing some important ideas that we have seen previously.\n1. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2.

Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3.

Next we perform another row replacement operation: \\[A_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1&-1&2\\\\ 0&0&-2\\\\ 3&-1&10\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1&-1&2\\\\ 0&0&-2\\\\ 0&2&4\\end{array}\\right]=A_{2}.\\] What is the relationship between \\(\\det(A)\\) and \\(\\det(A_{2})\\)?\n5. Finally, we perform an interchange: \\[A_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1&-1&2\\\\ 0&0&-2\\\\ 0&2&4\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1&-1&2\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 0&0&-2\\end{array}\\right]=U\\] to arrive at an upper triangular matrix \\(U\\). What is the relationship between \\(\\det(A)\\) and \\(\\det(U)\\)?\n* Since \\(U\\) is upper triangular, we can compute its determinant, which allows us to find \\(\\det(A)\\). What is \\(\\det(A)\\)? Is \\(A\\) invertible?\n* Now consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&-1&3\\\\ 0&2&-2\\\\ 2&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Perform a sequence of row operations to find an upper triangular matrix \\(U\\) that is row equivalent to \\(A\\). Use this to determine \\(\\det(A)\\) and whether \\(A\\) is invertible.\n* Suppose we apply a sequence of row operations on a matrix \\(A\\) to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\). Explain why \\(\\det(A)\\neq 0\\) if and only if \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})\\neq 0\\).\n* Explain why an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is invertible if and only if \\(\\det(A)\\neq 0\\).\nAs seen in this activity, row operations can be used to compute the determinant of a matrix.

Compute $(x_1/(x_2 + 1))^2 + (x_2 / (x_1 + 1))^2$.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nTriangular matrix.A triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. We first discuss this for a lower triangular matrix. Let \\(L\\) be \\(n\\times n\\) and lower triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. We show that the columns are linearly independent, _i.e._, \\(Lx=0\\) is only possible if \\(x=0\\). Expanding the matrix-vector product, we can write \\(Lx=0\\) as\n\\[L_{11}x_{1} = 0\\] \\[L_{21}x_{1}+L_{22}x_{2} = 0\\] \\[L_{31}x_{1}+L_{32}x_{2}+L_{33}x_{3} = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[L_{n1}x_{1}+L_{n2}x_{2}+\\cdots+L_{n,n-1}x_{n-1}+L_{nn}x_{n} = 0.\\]\nSince \\(L_{11}\\neq 0\\), the first equation implies \\(x_{1}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=0\\), the second equation reduces to \\(L_{22}x_{2}=0\\). Since \\(L_{22}\\neq 0\\), we conclude that \\(x_{2}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=x_{2}=0\\), the third equation now reduces to \\(L_{33}x_{3}=0\\), and since \\(L_{33}\\) is assumed to be nonzero, we have \\(x_{3}=0\\). Continuing this argument, we find that all entries of \\(x\\) are zero, and this shows that the columns of \\(L\\) are linearly independent. It follows that \\(L\\) is invertible.\nA similar argument can be followed to show that an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. One can also simply note that if \\(R\\) is upper triangular, then \\(L=R^{T}\\) is lower triangular with the same diagonal, and use the formula \\((L^{T})^{-1}=(L^{-1})^{T}\\) for the inverse of the transpose.\nInverse via QR factorization.The QR factorization gives a simple expression for the inverse of an invertible matrix. If \\(A\\) is square and invertible, its columns are linearly independent, so it has a QR factorization \\(A=QR\\). The matrix \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. Hence \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are invertible, and the formula for the inverse product gives\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Algorithm 18.2** Newton algorithm for solving nonlinear equations\nThe basic Newton algorithm shares the same shortcomings as the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm, _i.e._, it can diverge, and the iterations terminate if the derivative matrix is not invertible.\nNewton algorithm for \\(n=1\\).The Newton algorithm is easily understood for \\(n=1\\). The iteration is\n\\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-f(x^{(k)})/f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})\\] (18.9)\nand is illustrated in figure 18.2. To update \\(x^{(k)}\\) we form the Taylor approximation\n\\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)})\\]\nand set it to zero to find the next iterate \\(x^{(k+1)}\\). If \\(f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})\\neq 0\\), the solution of \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=0\\) is given by the right-hand side of (18.9). If \\(f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})=0\\), the Newton algorithm terminates with an error.\nFigure 18.2: One iteration of the Newton algorithm for solving an equation \\(f(x)=0\\) in one variable.\n**Example.** The function\n\\[f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}\\] (18.10)\nhas a unique zero at the origin, _i.e._, the only solution of \\(f(x)=0\\) is \\(x=0\\). (This function is called the _sigmoid function_, and will make another appearance later.) The Newton iteration started at \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) converges quickly to the solution \\(x=0\\). With \\(x^{(1)}=1.15\\), however, the iterates diverge. This is shown in figures 18.3 and 18.4.\nFigure 18.4: Value of \\(f(x^{(k)})\\) versus iteration number \\(k\\) for Newton’s method in the example of figure 18.3, started at \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) and \\(x^{(1)}=1.15\\).\nFigure 18.3: The first iterations in the Newton algorithm for solving \\(f(x)=0\\), for two starting points: \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) and \\(x^{(1)}=1.15\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nIn other words, beginning with \\(A\\), we augment by the identify and find the reduced row echelon form to determine \\(A^{-1}\\):\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}A\\end{array}\\right|I\\begin{array}{c}\\right]\\sim \\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}I\\end{array}\\right|A^{-1}\\begin{array}{c}\\right].\\]\nIn fact, this reformulation will always work. Suppose that \\(A\\) is an invertible \\(n\\times n\\) matrix with inverse \\(B\\). Suppose furthermore that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is any \\(n\\)-dimensional vector and consider the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\). We know that \\(x=B\\mathbf{b}\\) is a solution because \\(A(B\\mathbf{b})=(AB)\\mathbf{b}=I\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\).\n**Proposition 3.1.4**_If \\(A\\) is an invertible matrix with inverse \\(B\\), then any equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent and \\(\\mathbf{x}=B\\mathbf{b}\\) is a solution. In other words, the solution to \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}\\)._\nNotice that this is similar to saying that the solution to \\(3x=5\\) is \\(x=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 5\\), as we saw in the preview activity.\nNow since \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent for every vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), the columns of \\(A\\) must span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) so there is a pivot position in every row. Since \\(A\\) is also square, this means that the reduced row echelon form of \\(A\\) is the identity matrix.\n**Proposition 3.1.5**_The matrix \\(A\\) is invertible if and only if the reduced row echelon form of \\(A\\) is the identity matrix: \\(A\\sim I\\). In addition, we can find the inverse by augmenting \\(A\\) by the identity and finding the reduced row echelon form:_\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}A\\end{array}\\right|I\\begin{array}{c}\\right]\\sim \\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}I\\end{array}\\right|A^{-1}\\begin{array}{c}\\right].\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n4. A linear system where the right hand side of every equation is 0 is called _homogeneous_. The augmented matrix of a homogeneous system, for instance, has the following form: \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}*&*&*&*&0\\\\ *&*&*&*&0\\\\ *&*&*&*&0\\end{array}\\right].\\] 1. Using the concepts we've seen in this section, explain why a homogeneous linear system must be consistent. 2. What values for the variables are guaranteed to give a solution? Use this to offer another explanation for why a homogeneous linear system is consistent. 3. Suppose that a homogeneous linear system has a unique solution. 1. Give an example of such a system by writing its augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form. 2. Write just the coefficient matrix for the example you gave in the previous part. What can you say about the pivot positions in the coefficient matrix? Explain why your observation must hold for any homogeneous system having a unique solution. 3. If a homogeneous system of equations has a unique solution, what can you say about the number of equations compared to the number of variables?\nIn a previous math class, you have probably seen the fact that, if we are given two points in the plane, then there is a unique line passing through both of them. In this problem, we will begin with the four points on the left below and ask to find a polynomial that passes through these four points as shown on the right.\nA degree three polynomial can be written as\n\\[p(x)=a+bx+cx^{2}+dx^{3}\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are coefficients that we would like to determine. Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point \\((3,1)\\), we should require that\n\\[p(3)=a+3b+9c+27d=1.\\]\nIn this way, we obtain a linear equation for the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).\n1. Write the four linear equations for the coefficients obtained by requiring that the graph of the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) passes through the four points above. 2. Write the augmented matrix corresponding to this system of equations and use the Sage cell below to solve for the coefficients.\n\n\n",

What can you say about the pivot positions of \\(A\\)? 2. What can you say about the span of the columns of \\(A\\)? 3. If \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) is some other vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{12}\\), what can you conclude about the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}\\)? 4. What can you about the solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n5.

Explain why \\(\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}=\\mathrm{Span}\\{ \\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}\\).\n6. As defined in this section, the span of a set of vectors is generated by taking all possible linear combinations of those vectors. This exercise will demonstrate the fact that the span can also be realized as the solution space to a linear system. We will consider the vectors \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\\\ -2\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\] 1. Is every vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) in \\(\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}\\)? If not, describe the span.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n8. When we explored matrix multiplication in Section 2.2, we saw that some properties that are true for real numbers are not true for matrices. This exercise will investigate that in some more depth. 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two matrices and that \\(AB=0\\). If \\(B\\neq 0\\), what can you say about the linear independence of the columns of \\(A\\)? 2. Suppose that we have matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) such that \\(AB=AC\\). We have seen that we cannot generally conclude that \\(B=C\\). If we assume additionally that \\(A\\) is a matrix whose columns are linearly independent, explain why \\(B=C\\). You may wish to begin by rewriting the equation \\(AB=AC\\) as \\(AB-AC=A(B-C)=0\\).\n9. Suppose that \\(k\\) is an unknown parameter and consider the set of vectors \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\ -2\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 2\\\\ k\\end{array}\\right].\\] 1. For what values of \\(k\\) is the set of vectors linearly dependent? 2. For what values of \\(k\\) does the set of vectors span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\)?\n10. Given a set of linearly dependent vectors, we can eliminate some of the vectors to create a smaller, linearly independent set of vectors. 1. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is a linear combination of the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). Explain why \\(\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{w}\\}=\\operatorname {Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}\\). 2. Consider the vectors \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 6\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right],\\mathbf{v}_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}7\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\] Write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others. Find a set of three vectors whose span is the same as \\(\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3},\\mathbf{v}_ {4}\\}\\). 3. Are the three vectors you are left with linearly independent? If not, express one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others and find a set of two vectors\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIn the preview activity, we considered a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix \\(A\\) and found that the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) has a solution for some vectors \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) and has no solution for others.

The column space \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) contains all the vectors \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) for which the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is consistent. The null space \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\) is the solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), which reflects on the uniqueness of solutions to this and other equations.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nthe end of day \\(k\\), we then have \\[P_{k+1} =0.8P_{k}+0.6Q_{k}\\] \\[Q_{k+1} =0.2P_{k}+0.4Q_{k}.\\] We can write the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}P_{k}\\\\ Q_{k}\\end{array}\\right]\\) to reflect the number of cars at the two locations at the end of day \\(k\\), which says that \\[\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.8&0.6\\\\ 0.2&0.4\\end{array}\\right]\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\] or \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) where \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.8&0.6\\\\ 0.2&0.4\\end{array}\\right]\\). Suppose that \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\] Compute \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) to demonstrate that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are eigenvectors of \\(A\\). What are the associated eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}\\)? * We said that \\(1000\\) cars are initially at location \\(P\\) and none at location \\(Q\\). This means that the initial vector describing the number of cars is \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1000\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\). Write \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\) as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). * Remember that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are eigenvectors of \\(A\\). Use the linearity of matrix multiplication to write the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}=A\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\), describing the number of cars at the two locations at the end of the first day, as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). * Write the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2}=A\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\) as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). Then write the next few vectors as linear combinations of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\): 1. \\(\\mathbf{x}_{3}=A\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\). 2. \\(\\mathbf{x}_{4}=A\\mathbf{x}_{3}\\). 3. \\(\\mathbf{x}_{5}=A\\mathbf{x}_{4}\\). 4. \\(\\mathbf{x}_{6}=A\\mathbf{x}_{5}\\). * What will happen to the number of cars at the two locations after a very long time? Explain how writing \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors helps you determine the long-term behavior.\nThis activity is important and motivates much of our work with eigenvalues and eigenvectors so it's worth reviewing to make sure we have a clear understanding of the concepts.\nFirst, we compute\n\\[A\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.8&0.6\\\\ 0.2&0.4\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]=1\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\]\n\\[A\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.8&0.6\\\\ 0.2&0.4\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-0.2\\\\ 0.2\\end{array}\\right]=0.2\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nThis shows that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{1}=1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{2}=0.2\\).\nBy the linearity of matrix matrix multiplication, we have\n\\[A(c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2})=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+0.2c_{2} \\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nTherefore, we will write the vector describing the initial distribution of cars \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1000\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\) as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\); that is, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{0}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). To do, we form the augmented matrix and row reduce:\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\end{array}\\right| \\mathbf{x}_{0}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1\\\\ 1&1\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}1000\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}250\\\\ -250\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nwe know there are four eigenvalues \\(\\lambda=4,-5,1,3\\). Without more information, all we can say about the dimensions of the eigenspaces is\n\\[1\\leq\\dim E_{4}\\leq 2\\] \\[1\\leq\\dim E_{-5}\\leq 1\\] \\[1\\leq\\dim E_{1}\\leq 7\\] \\[1\\leq\\dim E_{3}\\leq 2.\\]\nWe can guarantee that \\(\\dim E_{-5}=1\\), but we cannot be more specific about the dimensions of the other eigenspaces.\nFortunately, if we have an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, it frequently happens that the characteristic equation has the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n}-\\lambda)=0\\]\nwhere there are \\(n\\) distinct real eigenvalues, each of which has multiplicity \\(1\\). In this case, the dimension of each of the eigenspaces \\(\\dim E_{\\lambda_{j}}=1\\). With a little work, it can be seen that choosing a basis vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{j}\\) for each of the eigenspaces produces a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\). We therefore have the following proposition.\n**Proposition 4.2.14**: _If \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix having \\(n\\) distinct real eigenvalues, then there is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors of \\(A\\)._\nThis proposition provides one answer to our Question 4.1.8. The next activity explores this question further.\n**Activity 4.2.4**.:\n1. Identify the eigenvalues, and their multiplicities, of an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix whose characteristic polynomial is \\((2-\\lambda)^{3}(-3-\\lambda)^{10}(5-\\lambda)\\). What can you conclude about the dimensions of the eigenspaces? What is the shape of the matrix? Do you have enough information to guarantee that there is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n6. What would happen if we were to compute \\(A_{4}\\)?\n7. What do you notice about the error \\(A-A_{k}\\) as \\(k\\) increases?\nIn this activity, the approximating matrix \\(A_{k}\\) has rank \\(k\\) because its singular value decomposition has \\(k\\) nonzero singular values. We then saw how the difference between \\(A\\) and the approximations \\(A_{k}\\) decreases as \\(k\\) increases, which means that the sequence \\(A_{k}\\) forms better approximations as \\(k\\) increases.\nAnother way to represent \\(A_{k}\\) is with a reduced singular value decomposition so that \\(A_{k}=U_{k}\\Sigma_{k}V_{k}^{T}\\) where\n\\[U_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{u}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\\Sigma_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{k}\\end{bmatrix},\\quad V_{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1 }&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_{k}\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nNotice that the rank \\(1\\) matrix \\(A_{1}\\) then has the form \\(A_{1}=\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}= \\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\) and that we can similarly write:\n\\[A\\approx A_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}\\]\n\\[A\\approx A_{2}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}\\] \\[A\\approx A_{3}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_ {2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}\\] \\[\\qquad\\vdots\\] \\[A=A_{r}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}+\\sigma_{2} \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}^{T}+\\sigma_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}^{T}+ \\ldots+\\sigma_{r}\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\mathbf{v}_{r}^{T}.\\]\nGiven two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the matrix \\(\\mathbf{u}\\)\\(\\mathbf{v}^{T}\\) is called the _outer product_ of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). (The dot product \\(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{u}^{T}\\mathbf{v}\\) is sometimes called the _inner product_.) An outer product will always be a rank 1 matrix so we see above how \\(A_{k}\\) is obtained by adding together \\(k\\) rank \\(1\\) matrices, each of which gets us one step closer to the original matrix \\(A\\).\n#### Principal component analysis\nIn Section 7.3, we explored principal component analysis as a technique to reduce the dimension of a dataset. In particular, we constructed the covariance matrix \\(C\\) from a demeaned data matrix and saw that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(C\\) tell us about the variance of the dataset in different directions. We referred to the eigenvectors of \\(C\\) as _principal components_ and found that projecting the data onto a subspace defined by the first few principal components frequently gave us a way to visualize the dataset. As we added more principal components, we retained more information about the original dataset. This feels similar to the rank \\(k\\) approximations we have just seen so let's explore the connection.\n\n\n",

Some care, however, is required when adding matrices. Since we need the same number of vectors to add and since those vectors must be of the same dimension, two matrices must have the same shape if we wish to form their sum.\n#### Matrix-vector multiplication and linear combinations\nA more important operation will be matrix multiplication as it allows us to compactly express linear systems. We now introduce the product of a matrix and a vector with an example.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}+\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\]\n_where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W^{\\perp}\\)._\nLet's summarize what we've found. If \\(Q\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) form an orthonormal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then\n* \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix, because this product computes the dot products between the columns of \\(Q\\).\n* \\(QQ^{T}\\) is the matrix the projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\).\nAs we've said before, matrix multiplication depends on the order in which we multiply the matrices, and we see this clearly here.\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\n\n",

Therefore, \\(Q\\) is a square matrix and is invertible.\nMoreover, since \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), we see that \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\) so finding the inverse of \\(Q\\) is as simple as writing its transpose. Matrices with this property are very special and will play an important role in our upcoming work. We will therefore give them a special name.\n**Definition 6.3.22** A square \\(m\\times m\\) matrix \\(Q\\) whose columns form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is called _orthogonal_.\nThis terminology can be a little confusing. We call a basis orthogonal if the basis vectors are orthogonal to one another. However, a matrix is orthogonal if the columns are orthogonal to one another and have unit length. It pays to keep this in mind when reading statements about orthogonal bases and orthogonal matrices. In the meantime, we record the following proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.23**_An orthogonal matrix \\(Q\\) is invertible and its inverse \\(Q^{-1}=Q^{T}\\)._\n#### Summary\nThis section introduced orthogonal sets and the projection formula that allows us to project vectors orthogonally onto a subspace.\n* Given an orthogonal set \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_{n}\\) that spans an \\(n\\)-dimensional subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector in \\(W\\) closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and may be written as \\[\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{1}}{\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{1}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{1}+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{2}}{\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{2}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}{\\mathbf{w}_{n} \\cdot\\mathbf{w}_{n}}\\ \\mathbf{w}_{n}.\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nTriangular matrix.A triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. We first discuss this for a lower triangular matrix. Let \\(L\\) be \\(n\\times n\\) and lower triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. We show that the columns are linearly independent, _i.e._, \\(Lx=0\\) is only possible if \\(x=0\\). Expanding the matrix-vector product, we can write \\(Lx=0\\) as\n\\[L_{11}x_{1} = 0\\] \\[L_{21}x_{1}+L_{22}x_{2} = 0\\] \\[L_{31}x_{1}+L_{32}x_{2}+L_{33}x_{3} = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[L_{n1}x_{1}+L_{n2}x_{2}+\\cdots+L_{n,n-1}x_{n-1}+L_{nn}x_{n} = 0.\\]\nSince \\(L_{11}\\neq 0\\), the first equation implies \\(x_{1}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=0\\), the second equation reduces to \\(L_{22}x_{2}=0\\). Since \\(L_{22}\\neq 0\\), we conclude that \\(x_{2}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=x_{2}=0\\), the third equation now reduces to \\(L_{33}x_{3}=0\\), and since \\(L_{33}\\) is assumed to be nonzero, we have \\(x_{3}=0\\). Continuing this argument, we find that all entries of \\(x\\) are zero, and this shows that the columns of \\(L\\) are linearly independent. It follows that \\(L\\) is invertible.\nA similar argument can be followed to show that an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. One can also simply note that if \\(R\\) is upper triangular, then \\(L=R^{T}\\) is lower triangular with the same diagonal, and use the formula \\((L^{T})^{-1}=(L^{-1})^{T}\\) for the inverse of the transpose.\nInverse via QR factorization.The QR factorization gives a simple expression for the inverse of an invertible matrix. If \\(A\\) is square and invertible, its columns are linearly independent, so it has a QR factorization \\(A=QR\\). The matrix \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. Hence \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are invertible, and the formula for the inverse product gives\n\\[A^{-1}=(QR)^{-1}=R^{-1}Q^{-1}=R^{-1}Q^{T}.\\] (11.3)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* Every stochastic matrix has a steady-state vector.\n* If \\(A\\) is a stochastic matrix, then any Markov chain defined by \\(A\\) converges to a steady-state vector.\n* If \\(A\\) is a stochastic matrix, then \\(\\lambda=1\\) is an eigenvalue and all the other eigenvalues satisfy \\(|\\lambda|<1\\).\n* A positive stochastic matrix has a unique steady-state vector.\n* If \\(A\\) is an invertible stochastic matrix, then so is \\(A^{-1}\\).\nFigure 4.5.12: The flow between urban, suburban, and rural populations.\nConsider the stochastic matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1&0.2&0.2\\\\ 0&0.6&0.2\\\\ 0&0.2&0.6\\end{array}\\right].\\] 1.

For example, quadratic forms appear in multivariable calculus when describing the behavior of a function of several variables near a critical point and in physics when describing the kinetic energy of a rigid body.\nFigure 7.2.9: The demeaned data from Preview Activity 7.2.1 is shown projected onto the lines of maximal and minimal variance.\nThe following definition will be important in this section.\n**Definition 7.2.11** A symmetric matrix \\(A\\) is called _positive definite_ if its associated quadratic form satisfies \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for any nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). If \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we say that \\(A\\) is _positive semidefinite_.\nLikewise, we say that \\(A\\) is _negative definite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nFinally, \\(A\\) is called _indefinite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for some \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for others.\n**Activity 7.2.4.** This activity explores the relationship between the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix and its definiteness.\n1.

How does this help you decide whether \\(D\\) is positive definite or not?\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nHowever, if all but the first eigenvalue satisfy \\(|\\lambda_{j}|<1\\), then there is a unique steady-state vector \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) and any Markov chain will converge to \\(\\mathbf{q}\\). This was the case for the matrix \\(B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.4&0.3\\\\ 0.6&0.7\\end{array}\\right]\\), whose eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_{1}=1\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=0.1\\). In this case, any Markov chain will converge to the unique steady-state vector \\(\\mathbf{q}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ \\frac{2}{3}\\end{array}\\right]\\).\nIn this way, we see that the eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix tell us whether a Markov chain will converge to a steady-state vector. However, it is somewhat inconvenient to compute the eigenvalues to answer this question. Is there some way to conclude that every Markov chain will converge to a steady-state vector without actually computing the eigenvalues? It turns out that there is a simple condition on the matrix \\(A\\) that guarantees this.\n**Definition 4.5.4** We say that a matrix \\(A\\) is _positive_ if either \\(A\\) or some power \\(A^{k}\\) has all positive entries.\n**Example 4.5.5** The matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) is not positive. We can see this because some of the entries of \\(A\\) are zero and therefore not positive. In addition, we see that \\(A^{2}=I\\), \\(A^{3}=A\\) and so forth. Therefore, every power of \\(A\\) also has some zero entries, which means that \\(A\\) is not positive.\nThe matrix \\(B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.4&0.3\\\\ 0.6&0.7\\end{array}\\right]\\) is positive because every entry of \\(B\\) is positive.\nAlso, the matrix \\(C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&0.5\\\\ 1&0.5\\end{array}\\right]\\) clearly has a zero entry. However, \\(C^{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.5&0.25\\\\ 0.5&0.75\\end{array}\\right]\\), which has all positive entries. Therefore, we see that \\(C\\) is a positive matrix.\n\n\n",

We will now develop a more algebraic understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we will find an algebraic method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.\n**Preview Activity 4.2.1.** Let's begin by reviewing some important ideas that we have seen previously.\n1.

What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* Suppose that \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times 4\\) matrix.\n* Is it possible that \\(\\dim\\,\\operatorname{Nul}(A)=0\\)?\n* If \\(\\dim\\,\\operatorname{Nul}(A)=1\\), what can you say about \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)?\n* If \\(\\dim\\,\\operatorname{Nul}(A)=2\\), what can you say about \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)?\n* If \\(\\dim\\,\\operatorname{Nul}(A)=3\\), what can you say about \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)?\n* If \\(\\dim\\,\\operatorname{Nul}(A)=4\\), what can you say about \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)?\nSuppose we have the vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 2\\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\mathbf{w}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\ \\mathbf{w}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 4\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand that \\(A\\) is a matrix such that \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)=\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Null}(A)=\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{w}_{1},\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\}\\).\nWhat are the dimensions of \\(A\\)?\nFind such a matrix \\(A\\).\nSuppose that \\(A\\) is an \\(8\\times 8\\) matrix and that \\(\\det A=14\\).\nWhat can you conclude about \\(\\mathrm{Null}(A)\\)?\nWhat can you conclude about \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\nSuppose that \\(A\\) is a matrix and there is an invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that\n\\[A=P\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2&0&0\\\\ 0&-3&0\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]P^{-1}.\\]\nWhat can you conclude about \\(\\mathrm{Null}(A)\\)?\nWhat can you conclude about \\(\\mathrm{Coll}(A)\\)?\nIn this section, we saw that the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) for some \\(p\\). In this exercise, we will investigate whether the solution space to another equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) can form a subspace.\nLet's consider the matrix\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2&-4\\\\ -1&2\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nFind a parametric description of the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nTo understand this proposition more fully, let's remember that the matrix \\(A\\) is invertible if and only if it is row equivalent to the identity matrix \\(I\\). We will therefore consider how the determinant changes when we perform row operations on a matrix. Along the way, we will discover an effective means to compute the determinant.\nIn Subsection 3.1.3, we saw how to describe the three row operations, scaling, interchange, and replacement, using matrix multiplication. If we perform a row operation on the matrix \\(A\\) to obtain the matrix \\(A^{\\prime}\\), we would like to relate \\(\\det(A)\\) and \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})\\). To do so, remember that\n* Scalings are performed by multiplying a matrix \\(A\\) by a diagonal matrix, such as \\[S=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\\\ 0&3&0\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right],\\] which has the effect of multiplying the second row of \\(A\\) by \\(3\\) to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\). Since \\(S\\) is diagonal, we know that its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries so that \\(\\det(S)=3\\). This means that \\(A^{\\prime}=SA\\) and therefore \\[\\det(A^{\\prime})=\\det(S)\\det(A)=3\\det(A).\\] In general, if we scale a row of \\(A\\) by \\(k\\), we have \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=k\\det(A)\\).\n* Interchanges are performed by matrices such as \\[P=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0&1&0\\\\ 1&0&0\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right],\\] which has the effect of interchanging the first and second rows of \\(A\\). As we saw in Proposition 3.4.8, \\(\\det(P)=-1\\). Therefore, when \\(PA=A^{\\prime}\\), we have \\[\\det(A^{\\prime})=\\det(P)\\det(A)=-\\det(A).\\] In other words, \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=-\\det(A)\\) when we perform an interchange.\n\n\n",

In particular, when \\(n=2\\), the determinant is the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the two columns of the matrix.\n* The determinant satisfies many properties. For instance, \\(\\det(AB)=\\det(A)\\det(B)\\) and the determinant of a triangular matrix is equal to the product of its diagonal entries.\n* These properties helped us compute the determinant of a matrix using row operations. This also led to the important observation that the determinant of a matrix is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n7.

Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with associated eigenvalue -4 and with length 7. What is \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\)?\nLinear algebra is principally about things that are linear. However, quadratic forms, as the name implies, have a distinctly non-linear character. First, if \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\ b&c\\end{array}\\right]\\), is a symmetric matrix, then the associated quadratic form is\n\\[q_{A}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=ax_{1}^{2}+2bx_{1}x_{2}+cx_{2}^{2}.\\]\nNotice how the variables \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) are multiplied together, which tells us this isn't a linear function.\nThis expression assumes an especially simple form when \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix. In particular, if \\(D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&0\\\\ 0&c\\end{array}\\right]\\), then \\(q_{D}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=ax_{1}^{2}+cx_{2}^{2}\\). This is special because there is no cross-term involving \\(x_{1}x_{2}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nwhere the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) is the Jacobian or derivative matrix of \\(f\\) (see SS8.2.1 and SSC.1). The affine function \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\) is a very good approximation of \\(f(x)\\) provided \\(x\\) is near \\(x^{(k)}\\), _i.e._, \\(\\|x-x^{(k)}\\|\\) is small.\nThe next iterate \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is then taken to be the minimizer of \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\), the norm squared of the affine approximation of \\(f\\) at \\(x^{(k)}\\). Assuming that the derivative matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) has linearly independent columns (which requires \\(m\\geq n\\)), we have\n\\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\\left(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T} f(x^{(k)}).\\] (18.6)\nThis iteration gives the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm.\n**given** a differentiable function \\(f:\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{R}^{m}\\), an initial point \\(x^{(1)}\\).\nFor \\(k=1,2,\\ldots,k^{\\max}\\)\n1. _Form affine approximation at current iterate using calculus._ Evaluate the Jacobian \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) and define \\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+Df(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)}).\\]\n2. _Update iterate using linear least squares._ Set \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) as the minimizer of \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\), \\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\\left(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T} f(x^{(k)}).\\]\nThe Gauss-Newton algorithm is terminated early if \\(f(x)\\) is very small, or \\(x^{(k+1)}\\approx x^{(k)}\\). It terminates with an error if the columns of \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) are linearly dependent.\nThe condition \\(x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}\\) (the exact form of our stopping condition) holds when\n\\[\\left(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T}f(x^{(k)})=0,\\]\nwhich occurs if and only if \\(Df(x^{(k)})^{T}f(x^{(k)})=0\\) (since we assume that \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) has linearly independent columns). So the Gauss-Newton algorithm stops only when the optimality condition (18.3) holds.\nWe can also observe that\n\\[\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k+1)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\leq\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}=\\|f(x^{(k) })\\|^{2}\\] (18.7)\nholds, since \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) minimizes \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\), and \\(\\hat{f}(x^{(k)};x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})\\). The norm of the _residual of the approximation_ goes down in each iteration. This is _not_ the same as\n\\[\\|f(x^{(k+1)})\\|^{2}\\leq\\|f(x^{(k)})\\|^{2},\\] (18.8)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane. The function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is defined as\n\\[\\hat{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}p(x)&x\\leq a\\\\ q(x)&x>a,\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nwith \\(a\\) given, and \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) polynomials of degree three or less,\n\\[p(x)=\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x+\\theta_{3}x^{2}+\\theta_{4}x^{3},\\qquad q(x)=\\theta _{5}+\\theta_{6}x+\\theta_{7}x^{2}+\\theta_{8}x^{3}.\\]\nWe also impose the condition that \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\), so that \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is continuous and has a continuous first derivative at \\(x=a\\). Suppose the \\(N\\) data\nFigure 16.1: Least squares fit of two cubic polynomials to 140 points, with continuity constraints \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\).\npoints \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) are numbered so that \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{M}\\leq a\\) and \\(x_{M+1},\\ldots,x_{N}>a\\). The sum of squares of the prediction errors is\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{M}(\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x_{i}+\\theta_{3}x_{i}^{2}+\\theta_{4}x_{i}^{ 3}-y_{i})^{2}+\\sum_{i=M+1}^{N}(\\theta_{5}+\\theta_{6}x_{i}+\\theta_{7}x_{i}^{2}+ \\theta_{8}x_{i}^{3}-y_{i})^{2}.\\]\nThe conditions \\(p(a)-q(a)=0\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)-q^{\\prime}(a)=0\\) are two linear equations\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nAs this activity shows, the singular values of \\(A\\) are the maximum and minimum values of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|Ax|\\) among all unit vectors and the right singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are the directions in which they occur. The key to finding the singular values and vectors is to utilize the Gram matrix \\(G\\) and its associated quadratic form \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\). We will illustrate with some more examples.\n**Example 7.4.2** We will find a singular value decomposition of the matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\ -1&2\\end{bmatrix}\\). Notice that this matrix is not symmetric so it cannot be orthogonally diagonalized.\nWe begin by constructing the Gram matrix \\(G=A^{T}A=\\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\\\ 0&8\\end{bmatrix}\\). Since \\(G\\) is symmetric, it can be orthogonally diagonalized with\n\\[D=\\begin{bmatrix}8&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{bmatrix},\\hskip 28.452756ptQ=\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ 1&0\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nWe now know that the maximum value of the quadratic form \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is \\(8\\), which occurs in the direction \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). Since \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\), this tells us that the maximum value of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\), the first singular value, is \\(\\sigma_{1}=\\sqrt{8}\\) and that this occurs in the direction of the first right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\).\nIn the same way, we also know that the second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}=\\sqrt{2}\\) with associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\).\nThe first left singular vector \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) is defined by \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\). Because \\(\\sigma_{1}=\\sqrt{8}\\), we have \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). Notice that \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) is a unit vector because \\(\\sigma_{1}=|A\\mathbf{v}_{1}|\\).\nIn the same way, the second left singular vector is defined by \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right]=\\sigma_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), which gives us \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n* The second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) is the minimum value of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) is a unit vector describing a direction in which this minimum occurs. Use the diagram to find the second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n* Here's how we can find the right singular values and vectors without using the diagram. Remember that \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\) where \\(G=A^{T}A\\) is the Gram matrix associated to \\(A\\). Since \\(G\\) is symmetric, it is orthogonally diagonalizable. Find \\(G\\) and an orthogonal diagonalization of it.\nWhat is the maximum value of the quadratic form \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) among all unit vectors and in which direction does it occur? What is the minimum value of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and in which direction does it occur?\n* Because \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\), the first singular value \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) will be the square root of the maximum value of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) the square root of the minimum. Verify that the singular values that you found from the diagram are the square roots of the maximum and minimum values of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\).\n* Verify that the right singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) that you found from the diagram are the directions in which the maximum and minimum values occur.\n* Finally, we introduce the _left singular vectors_\\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) by requiring that \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\sigma_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\).

Let \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) be the solution of (15.7), _i.e._, the minimizer of\n\\[\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{2}+\\lambda(\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\theta_{p}^{2}),\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**19.3**: _Boolean least squares._ The _Boolean least squares problem_ is a special case of the constrained nonlinear least squares problem (19.1), with the form\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&x_{i}^{2}=1,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n,\\end{array}\\]\nwhere the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is the variable to be chosen, and the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) and the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\) are the (given) problem data. The constraints require that each entry of \\(x\\) is either \\(-1\\) or \\(+1\\), _i.e._, \\(x\\) is a Boolean vector. Since each entry can take one of two values, there are \\(2^{n}\\) feasible values for the vector \\(x\\). The Boolean least squares problem arises in many applications.\nOne simple method for solving the Boolean least squares problem, sometimes called the _brute force method_, is to evaluate the objective function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) for each of the \\(2^{n}\\) possible values, and choose one that has the least value. This method is not practical for \\(n\\) larger than 30 or so. There are many heuristic methods that are much faster to carry out than the brute force method, and approximately solve it, _i.e._, find an \\(x\\) for which the objective is small, if not the smallest possible value over all \\(2^{n}\\) feasible values of \\(x\\). One such heuristic is the augmented Lagrangian algorithm 19.2.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n3. _Matrix least norm problem_. The matrix least norm problem is minimize \\[\\|X\\|^{2}\\] subject to \\[CX=D,\\] where the variable to be chosen is the \\(n\\times k\\) matrix \\(X\\); the \\(p\\times n\\) matrix \\(C\\) and the \\(p\\times k\\) matrix \\(D\\) are given. Show that the solution of this problem is \\(\\hat{X}=C^{\\dagger}D\\), assuming the rows of \\(C\\) are linearly independent. _Hint_. Show that we can find the columns of \\(X\\) independently, by solving a least norm problem for each one.\n4. _Closest solution to a given point_. Suppose the wide matrix \\(A\\) has linearly independent rows. Find an expression for the point \\(x\\) that is closest to a given vector \\(y\\) (_i.e._, minimizes \\(\\|x-y\\|^{2}\\)) among all vectors that satisfy \\(Ax=b\\). _Remark_. This problem comes up when \\(x\\) is some set of inputs to be found, \\(Ax=b\\) represents some set of requirements, and \\(y\\) is some nominal value of the inputs. For example, when the inputs represent actions that are re-calculated each day (say, because \\(b\\) changes every day), \\(y\\) might be yesterday's action, and the today's action \\(x\\) found as above gives the least change from yesterday's action, subject to meeting today's requirements.\n5. _Nearest vector with a given average_. Let \\(a\\) be an \\(n\\)-vector and \\(\\beta\\) a scalar. How would you find the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) that is closest to \\(a\\) among all \\(n\\)-vectors that have average value \\(\\beta\\)? Give a formula for \\(x\\) and describe it in English.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* Show that \\(\\|x-\\tilde{x}\\|\\) does not depend on \\(b\\); it only depends on the matrix \\(A\\), \\(\\epsilon\\), and \\(j\\).\n* How would you find the index \\(j\\) that maximizes the value of \\(\\|x-\\tilde{x}\\|\\)? By part (a), your answer should be in terms of \\(A\\) (or quantities derived from \\(A\\)) and \\(\\epsilon\\) only. _Remark._ If a small change in the right-hand side vector \\(b\\) can lead to a large change in the solution, we say that the linear equations \\(Ax=b\\) are _poorly conditioned_ or _ill-conditioned_. As a practical matter it means that unless you are very confident in what the entries of \\(b\\) are, the solution \\(A^{-1}b\\) may not be useful in practice.\n* _Timing test._ Generate a random \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) and an \\(n\\)-vector \\(b\\), for \\(n=500\\), \\(n=1000\\), and \\(n=2000\\). For each of these, compute the solution \\(x=A^{-1}b\\) (for example using the backslash operator, if the software you are using supports it), and verify that \\(Ax-b\\) is (very) small. Report the time it takes to solve each of these three sets of linear equations, and for each one work out the implied speed of your processor in Gflop/s, based on the \\(2n^{3}\\) complexity of solving equations using the QR factorization.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe refer to the function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) as the _objective_ of the problem, and the set of \\(p\\) linear equality constraints \\(Cx=d\\) as the _constraints_ of the problem. They can be written out as \\(p\\) scalar constraints (equations)\n\\[c_{i}^{T}x=d_{i},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,p,\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i}^{T}\\) is the \\(i\\)th row of \\(C\\).\nAn \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is called _feasible_ (for the problem (16.1)) if it satisfies the constraints, _i.e._, \\(Cx=d\\). An \\(n\\)-vector \\(\\hat{x}\\) is called an _optimal point_ or _solution_ of the optimization problem (16.1) if it is feasible, and if \\(\\|A\\hat{x}-b\\|^{2}\\leq\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) holds for any feasible \\(x\\). In other words, \\(\\hat{x}\\) solves the problem (16.1) if it is feasible and has the smallest possible value of the objective function among all feasible vectors.\nThe constrained least squares problem combines the problems of solving a set of linear equations (find \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(Cx=d\\)) with the least squares problem\n(find \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\)). Indeed each of these problems can be considered a special case of the constrained least squares problem (16.1).\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\n\n",

However, it is somewhat inconvenient to compute the eigenvalues to answer this question. Is there some way to conclude that every Markov chain will converge to a steady-state vector without actually computing the eigenvalues? It turns out that there is a simple condition on the matrix \\(A\\) that guarantees this.\n**Definition 4.5.4** We say that a matrix \\(A\\) is _positive_ if either \\(A\\) or some power \\(A^{k}\\) has all positive entries.\n**Example 4.5.5** The matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) is not positive.

Therefore, every power of \\(A\\) also has some zero entries, which means that \\(A\\) is not positive.\nThe matrix \\(B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.4&0.3\\\\ 0.6&0.7\\end{array}\\right]\\) is positive because every entry of \\(B\\) is positive.\nAlso, the matrix \\(C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&0.5\\\\ 1&0.5\\end{array}\\right]\\) clearly has a zero entry. However, \\(C^{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0.5&0.25\\\\ 0.5&0.75\\end{array}\\right]\\), which has all positive entries. Therefore, we see that \\(C\\) is a positive matrix.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n#### Definite symmetric matrices\nWhile our questions about variance provide some motivation for exploring quadratic forms, these functions appear in a variety of other contexts so it's worth spending some more time with them.

We denote the \\(n\\)-vector of channel spending as \\(s\\); this spending results in a set of views (across the demographic groups) given by the \\(m\\)-vector \\(Rs\\).

(This can also be described as _allocating_ a total budget \\(B\\) across the \\(n\\) different channels.) This leads to the constrained least squares problem\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane. The function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is defined as\n\\[\\hat{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}p(x)&x\\leq a\\\\ q(x)&x>a,\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nwith \\(a\\) given, and \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) polynomials of degree three or less,\n\\[p(x)=\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x+\\theta_{3}x^{2}+\\theta_{4}x^{3},\\qquad q(x)=\\theta _{5}+\\theta_{6}x+\\theta_{7}x^{2}+\\theta_{8}x^{3}.\\]\nWe also impose the condition that \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\), so that \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is continuous and has a continuous first derivative at \\(x=a\\). Suppose the \\(N\\) data\nFigure 16.1: Least squares fit of two cubic polynomials to 140 points, with continuity constraints \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\).\npoints \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) are numbered so that \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{M}\\leq a\\) and \\(x_{M+1},\\ldots,x_{N}>a\\). The sum of squares of the prediction errors is\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{M}(\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x_{i}+\\theta_{3}x_{i}^{2}+\\theta_{4}x_{i}^{ 3}-y_{i})^{2}+\\sum_{i=M+1}^{N}(\\theta_{5}+\\theta_{6}x_{i}+\\theta_{7}x_{i}^{2}+ \\theta_{8}x_{i}^{3}-y_{i})^{2}.\\]\nThe conditions \\(p(a)-q(a)=0\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)-q^{\\prime}(a)=0\\) are two linear equations\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nFigure 16.4: The smallest force sequence \\(f^{\\ln}\\) that transfers the mass over a unit distance in 10 steps. _Right:_ The resulting position of the mass \\(p(t)\\).\nwhich states that \\(\\hat{x}\\) satisfies the equality constraints \\(C\\hat{x}=d\\) (which we already knew). The first set of equations, however, is more informative. Expanding the objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) as a sum of terms involving the entries of \\(x\\) (as was done on page 229) and taking the partial derivative of \\(L\\) with respect to \\(x_{i}\\) we obtain\n\\[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_{i}}(\\hat{x},\\hat{z})=2\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(A^{T}A)_{ij }\\hat{x}_{j}-2(A^{T}b)_{i}+\\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\hat{z}_{j}(c_{j})_{i}=0.\\]\nThese equations can be written in compact matrix-vector form as\n\\[2(A^{T}A)\\hat{x}-2A^{T}b+C^{T}\\hat{z}=0.\\]\nCombining this set of linear equations with the feasibility conditions \\(C\\hat{x}=d\\), we can write the optimality conditions (16.3) as one set of \\(n+p\\) linear equations in the variables \\((\\hat{x},\\hat{z})\\):\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2A^{T}A&C^{T}\\\\ C&0\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{x}\\\\ \\hat{z}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2A^{T}b\\\\ d\\end{array}\\right].\\] (16.4)\nThese equations are called the _KKT equations_ for the constrained least squares problem. (KKT are the initials of the last names of William Karush, Harold Kuhn, and Albert Tucker, the three researchers who derived the optimality conditions for a more general form of constrained optimization problem.) The KKT equations (16.4) are an extension of the normal equations (12.4) for a least squares problem with no constraints. So we have reduced the constrained least squares problem to the problem of solving a (square) set of \\(n+p\\) linear equations in \\(n+p\\) variables \\((\\hat{x},\\hat{z})\\).\n\n\n",

Explain your response.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[(\\lambda-4)(\\lambda-2)=0.\\]\nThis shows us that the eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda=4\\) and \\(\\lambda=2\\).\nIn general, the expression \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\) is a polynomial in \\(\\lambda\\), which is called the _characteristic polynomial_ of \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, the degree of the characteristic polynomial is \\(n\\). For instance, if \\(A\\) is a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix, then \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\) is a quadratic polynomial; if \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix, then \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\) is a cubic polynomial.\nThe matrix in Example 4.2.1 has a characteristic polynomial with two real and distinct roots. This will not always be the case, as demonstrated in the next two examples.\n**Example 4.2.2** Consider the matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}5&-1\\\\ 4&1\\end{bmatrix}\\), whose characteristic equation is\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+9=(\\lambda-3)^{2}=0.\\]\nIn this case, the characteristic polynomial has one real root, which means that this matrix has a single real eigenvalue, \\(\\lambda=3\\).\n**Example 4.2.3** To find the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix, we remember that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the entries on the diagonal. For instance, the following triangular matrix has the characteristic equation\n\\[\\det\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4&2&3\\\\ 0&-2&-1\\\\ 0&0&3\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda I\\right)=\\ \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4- \\lambda&2&3\\\\ 0&-2-\\lambda&-1\\\\ 0&0&3-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\\[=(4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0,\\]\nshowing that the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries \\(\\lambda=4,-2,3\\).\n#### Finding eigenvectors\nNow that we can find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\) by solving the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\), we will turn to the question of finding the eigenvectors associated to an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). The key, as before, is to note that an eigenvector is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). In other words, the eigenvectors associated to an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) form the null space \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n3.

What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6.

Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n\n\n",

In this exercise, we will investigate whether the solution space to another equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) can form a subspace.\nLet's consider the matrix\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2&-4\\\\ -1&2\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nFind a parametric description of the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix and that there is a matrix \\(P\\) such that \\[A=P\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}2&0&0\\\\ 0&-5&0\\\\ 0&0&-3\\end{array}\\right]P^{-1}.\\] Find \\(\\det(A)\\).\n4. Consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-2&1&k\\\\ 2&3&0\\\\ 1&2&2\\end{array}\\right]\\] where \\(k\\) is a parameter. 1. Find an expression for \\(\\det(A)\\) in terms of the parameter \\(k\\). 2. Use your expression for \\(\\det(A)\\) to determine the values of \\(k\\) for which the vectors \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-2\\\\ 2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 3\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}k\\\\ 0\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly independent.\n5. Determine whether the following statements are true or false and explain your response. 1. If we have a square matrix \\(A\\) and multiply the first row by \\(5\\) and add it to the third row to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=5\\det(A)\\). 2. If we interchange two rows of a matrix, then the determinant is unchanged. 3. If we scale a row of the matrix \\(A\\) by \\(17\\) to obtain \\(A^{\\prime}\\), then \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=17\\det(A)\\). 4. If \\(A\\) and \\(A^{\\prime}\\) are row equivalent and \\(\\det(A^{\\prime})=0\\), then \\(\\det(A)=0\\) also. 5. If \\(A\\) is row equivalent to the identity matrix, then \\(\\det(A)=\\det(I)=1\\).\n6. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(5\\times 5\\) matrices such that \\(\\det(A)=-2\\) and \\(\\det(B)=5\\).

For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\\[(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)^{m_{1}}(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)^{m_{2}}\\dots(\\lambda_{p}- \\lambda)^{m_{p}}=0.\\]\n\n\n",

When we explored matrix multiplication in Section 2.2, we saw that some properties that are true for real numbers are not true for matrices. This exercise will investigate that in some more depth. 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two matrices and that \\(AB=0\\). If \\(B\\neq 0\\), what can you say about the linear independence of the columns of \\(A\\)? 2. Suppose that we have matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) such that \\(AB=AC\\). We have seen that we cannot generally conclude that \\(B=C\\). If we assume additionally that \\(A\\) is a matrix whose columns are linearly independent, explain why \\(B=C\\). You may wish to begin by rewriting the equation \\(AB=AC\\) as \\(AB-AC=A(B-C)=0\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIt is certainly true that \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}, \\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\}\\) by the definition of the column space. However, the reduced row echelon form of the matrix shows us that the vectors are not linearly independent so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) do not form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nFrom the reduced row echelon form, however, we can see that\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_{3} = -2\\mathbf{v}_{1}+\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{v}_{4} = -3\\mathbf{v}_{1}+\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\] \\[\\mathbf{v}_{5} = -2\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\]\nThis means that any linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) can be written as a linear combination of just \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). Therefore, we see that \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\}\\).\nMoreover, the reduced row echelon form shows that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are linearly independent, which implies that they form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This means that \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is a 2-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{3}\\), which is a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\), having basis\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -4\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn general, a column without a pivot position can be written as a linear combination of the columns that have pivot positions.

Let \\(x\\) be an \\(n\\)-vector which satisfies \\((A^{T}A)x=0\\). Multiplying on the left by \\(x^{T}\\) we get\n\\[0=x^{T}0=x^{T}(A^{T}Ax)=x^{T}A^{T}Ax=\\|Ax\\|^{2},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(Ax=0\\). Since the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent, we conclude that \\(x=0\\). Since the only solution of \\((A^{T}A)x=0\\) is \\(x=0\\), we conclude that \\(A^{T}A\\) is invertible.\nNow let's show the converse. Suppose the columns of \\(A\\) are linearly dependent, which means there is a nonzero \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) which satisfies \\(Ax=0\\). Multiply on the left by \\(A^{T}\\) to get \\((A^{T}A)x=0\\). This shows that the Gram matrix \\(A^{T}A\\) is singular.\nPseudo-inverse of square or tall matrix.We show here that if \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns (and therefore, is square or tall) then it has a left inverse. (We already have observed the converse, that a matrix with a left inverse has linearly independent columns.) Assuming \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns, we know that \\(A^{T}A\\) is invertible. We now observe that the matrix \\((A^{T}A)^{-1}A^{T}\\) is a left inverse of \\(A\\):\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Zero divisors:**: It is _not_ generally true that \\(AB=0\\) implies that either \\(A=0\\) or \\(B=0\\).\n#### Summary\nIn this section, we have found an especially simple way to express linear systems using matrix multiplication.\n* If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) an \\(n\\)-dimensional vector, then \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) is the linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\) using the components of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as weights. The vector \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) is \\(m\\)-dimensional.\n* The solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) is the same as the solution space to the linear system corresponding to the augmented matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}A&\\mathbf{b}\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n* If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and \\(B\\) is an \\(n\\times p\\) matrix, we can form the product \\(AB\\), which is an \\(m\\times p\\) matrix whose columns are the products of \\(A\\) and the columns of \\(B\\).\n#### Exercises\n1. Consider the system of linear equations \\[\\begin{array}{rll}x+2y-&z=&1\\\\ 3x+2y+2z&=&7.\\\\ -x&+4z=-3\\end{array}\\] 2. Find the matrix \\(A\\) and vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that expresses this linear system in the form \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\).\n2. Give a description of the solution space to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\).\n2. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a \\(135\\times 2201\\) matrix, and that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a vector. If \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) is defined, what is the dimension of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)? What is the dimension of \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\)?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n7. Given below are some descriptions of sets of vectors that form the columns of a matrix \\(A\\). For each description, give a possible reduced row echelon form for \\(A\\) or indicate why there is no set of vectors satisfying the description by stating why the required reduced row echelon matrix cannot exist. 1. A set of 4 linearly independent vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{5}\\). 2. A set of 4 linearly independent vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). 3. A set of 3 vectors whose span is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). 4. A set of 5 linearly independent vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\). 5. A set of 5 vectors whose span is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).\n8. When we explored matrix multiplication in Section 2.2, we saw that some properties that are true for real numbers are not true for matrices. This exercise will investigate that in some more depth. 1. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two matrices and that \\(AB=0\\). If \\(B\\neq 0\\), what can you say about the linear independence of the columns of \\(A\\)? 2. Suppose that we have matrices \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) such that \\(AB=AC\\). We have seen that we cannot generally conclude that \\(B=C\\). If we assume additionally that \\(A\\) is a matrix whose columns are linearly independent, explain why \\(B=C\\). You may wish to begin by rewriting the equation \\(AB=AC\\) as \\(AB-AC=A(B-C)=0\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe have now reduced the problem of minimizing the weighted sum least squares objective to a standard least squares problem. Provided the columns of \\(\\tilde{A}\\) are linearly independent, the minimizer is unique, and given by\n\\[\\hat{x} = (\\tilde{A}^{T}\\tilde{A})^{-1}\\tilde{A}^{T}\\tilde{b}\\] (15.3) \\[= (\\lambda_{1}A_{1}^{T}A_{1}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}A_{k}^{T}A_{k})^{-1 }(\\lambda_{1}A_{1}^{T}b_{1}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}A_{k}^{T}b_{k}).\\]\nThis reduces to our standard formula for the solution of a least squares problem when \\(k=1\\) and \\(\\lambda_{1}=1\\). (In fact, when \\(k=1\\), \\(\\lambda_{1}\\) does not matter.) We can compute \\(\\hat{x}\\) via the QR factorization of \\(\\tilde{A}\\).\nIndependent columns of stacked matrix.Our assumption (12.2) that the columns of \\(\\tilde{A}\\) in (15.2) are linearly independent is not the same as assuming that each of \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{k}\\) has linearly independent columns. We can state the condition that \\(\\tilde{A}\\) has linearly independent columns as: There is no nonzero vector \\(x\\) that satisfies\n\\(A_{i}x=0\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots,k\\). This implies that if just _one_ of the matrices \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{k}\\) has linearly independent columns, then \\(\\tilde{A}\\) does.\nThe stacked matrix \\(\\tilde{A}\\) can have linearly independent columns even when none of the matrices \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{k}\\) do. This can happen when \\(m_{i}<n\\) for all \\(i\\), _i.e._, all \\(A_{i}\\) are wide. However, we must have \\(m_{1}+\\cdots+m_{k}\\geq n\\), since \\(\\tilde{A}\\) must be tall or square for the linearly independent columns assumption to hold.\nOptimal trade-off curve.We start with the special case of two objectives (also called the _bi-criterion problem_), and write the weighted sum objective as\n\\[J=J_{1}+\\lambda J_{2}=\\|A_{1}x-b_{1}\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|A_{2}x-b_{2}\\|^{2},\\]\n\n\n",

More specifically, any matrix \\(A\\) defines a function\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|A\\mathbf{x}|,\\]\nwhich measures the length of \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\). For example, the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-2\\end{bmatrix}\\) gives the function \\(l_{D}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{9x_{1}^{2}+4x_{2}^{2}}\\). The presence of the square root means that this function is not a quadratic form. We can, however, define the singular values and vectors by looking for the maximum and minimum of this function \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{u})\\) among all unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\).\nWhile \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is not itself a quadratic form, it becomes one if we square it:\n\\[(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x}))^{2}=|A\\mathbf{x}|^{2}=(A\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})= \\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A^{T}A\\mathbf{x})=q_{A^{T}A}(\\mathbf{x}).\\]\nWe call \\(G=A^{T}A\\), the _Gram matrix_ associated to \\(A\\) and note that\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}.\\]\nThis is important in the next activity, which introduces singular values and singular vectors.\n**Activity 7.4.2**.: The following interactive figure will help us explore singular values and vectors geometrically before we begin a more algebraic approach.\nThere is an interactive diagram, available at gvsu.edu/s/0VE, that accompanies this activity.\n**Figure 7.4.1** Singular values, right singular vectors and left singular vectors\nSelect the matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\ -2&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\).

Its columns are linearly independent provided the numbers \\(x^{(1)},\\ldots,x^{(N)}\\) include at least \\(p\\) different values. Figure 13.6 shows an example of the least squares fit of polynomials of degree 2, 6, 10, and 15 to a set of 100 data points. Since any polynomial of degree less than \\(r\\) is also a polynomial of degree less than \\(s\\), for \\(r\\leq s\\), it follows that the RMS fit attained by a polynomial with a larger degree is smaller (or at least, no larger) than that obtained by a fit with a smaller degree polynomial. This suggests that we should use the largest degree polynomial that we can, since this results in the smallest residual and the best RMS fit. But we will see in SS13.2 that this is not true, and explore rational methods for choosing a model from among several candidates.\n\n\n",

Then \\(Rw\\), which is a \\(T\\)-vector, is the time series of the portfolio returns over the periods \\(1,\\ldots,T\\). As an example, consider a portfolio of the 4 assets in table 6.1, with weights \\(w=(0.4,0.3,-0.2,0.5)\\). The product \\(Rw=(0.00213,-0.00201,0.00241)\\) gives the portfolio returns over the three periods in the example.\n* _Polynomial evaluation at multiple points._ Suppose the entries of the \\(n\\)-vector \\(c\\) are the coefficients of a polynomial \\(p\\) of degree \\(n-1\\) or less: \\[p(t)=c_{1}+c_{2}t+\\cdots+c_{n-1}t^{n-2}+c_{n}t^{n-1}.\\] Let \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\) be \\(m\\) numbers, and define the \\(m\\)-vector \\(y\\) as \\(y_{i}=p(t_{i})\\). Then we have \\(y=Ac\\), where \\(A\\) is the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&t_{1}&\\cdots&t_{1}^{n-2}&t_{1}^{n-1}\\\\ 1&t_{2}&\\cdots&t_{2}^{n-2}&t_{2}^{n-1}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 1&t_{m}&\\cdots&t_{m}^{n-2}&t_{m}^{n-1}\\end{array}\\right].\\] (6.7)\nSo multiplying a vector \\(c\\) by the matrix \\(A\\) is the same as evaluating a polynomial with coefficients \\(c\\) at \\(m\\) points. The matrix \\(A\\) in (6.7) comes up often, and is called a _Vandermonde matrix_ (of degree \\(n-1\\), at the points \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\)), named for the mathematician Alexandre-Theophile Vandermonde.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* We can use Sage to find the eigenvalues and eigenvalues of matrices.

If \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of multiplicity \\(1\\), then \\(E_{\\lambda}\\) is one-dimensional. 3. If a matrix \\(A\\) is invertible, then \\(\\lambda=0\\) cannot be an eigenvalue. 4.

For example, we have\n\\[\\|a-c\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\] (3.3)\nThis follows from the triangle inequality, since\n\\[\\|a-c\\|=\\|(a-b)+(b-c)\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\]\nThis is illustrated in figure 3.2.\nFigure 3.2: Triangle inequality.\n#### Examples.\n* _Feature distance._ If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent vectors of \\(n\\) features of two objects, the quantity \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) is called the _feature distance_, and gives a measure of how different the objects are (in terms of their feature values). Suppose for example the feature vectors are associated with patients in a hospital, with entries such as weight, age, presence of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and the results of tests. We can use feature vector distance to say that one patient case is near another one (at least in terms of their feature vectors).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nThis leads to \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\). In the same way, we find that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right]\\) so that the matrix \\(A\\) is\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe can verify there is exactly one path of length two from vertex 1 to itself, _i.e._, the path \\((1,2,1))\\), and one path of length two from vertex 3 to vertex 1, _i.e._, the path \\((3,2,1)\\). There are two paths of length two from vertex 4 to vertex 3, \\((4,3,3)\\) and \\((4,5,3)\\), so \\((A^{2})_{34}=2\\).\nThe property extends to higher powers of \\(A\\). If \\(\\ell\\) is a positive integer, then the \\(i,j\\) element of \\(A^{\\ell}\\) is the number of paths of length \\(\\ell\\) from vertex \\(j\\) to vertex \\(i\\). This can be proved by induction on \\(\\ell\\). We have already shown the result for \\(\\ell=2\\). Assume that it is true that the elements of \\(A^{\\ell}\\) give the paths of length \\(\\ell\\) between the different vertices. Consider the expression for the \\(i,j\\) element of \\(A^{\\ell+1}\\):\n\\[(A^{\\ell+1})_{ij}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{ik}(A^{\\ell})_{kj}.\\]\nThe \\(k\\)th term in the sum is equal to the number of paths of length \\(\\ell\\) from \\(j\\) to \\(k\\) if there is an edge from \\(k\\) to \\(i\\), and is equal to zero otherwise. Therefore it is equal to the number of paths of length \\(\\ell+1\\) from \\(j\\) to \\(i\\) that end with the edge \\((k,i)\\), _i.e._, of the form \\((j,\\ldots,k,i)\\). By summing over all \\(k\\) we obtain the total number of paths of length \\(\\ell+1\\) from vertex \\(j\\) to \\(i\\).\nFigure 10.1: Directed graph.\nThis can be verified in the example. The third power of \\(A\\) is\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nGiven a set of linear equations, there are either:\n* infinitely many points,\n* exactly one point, or\n* no points\nthat satisfy every equation in the set.\nNotice that we can see a bit more. In Figure 1.1, we are looking at equations in two unknowns. Here we see that\n* One equation has infinitely many solutions.\n* Two equations have exactly one solution.\n* Three equations have no solutions.\nFigure 1.1.1 Three possible graphs for sets of linear equations in two unknowns.\n### 1.1 What can we expect\nIt seems reasonable to wonder if the number of solutions depends on whether the number of equations is less than, equal to, or greater than the number of unknowns. Of course, one of the examples in the activity shows that there are exceptions to this simple rule, as seen in Figure 1.1.2. For instance, two equations in two unknowns may correspond to parallel lines so that the set of equations has no solutions. It may also happen that a set of three equations in two unknowns has a single solution. However, it seems safe to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of solutions will be.\nLet's also consider some examples of equations having three unknowns, which we call \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Just as solutions to linear equations in two unknowns formed straight lines, solutions to linear equations in three unknowns form planes.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n* On the grid below, graph the lines \\[y =x+1\\] \\[y =2x-1\\] \\[y =-x.\\] At what point or points \\((x,y)\\), do the lines intersect? How many points \\((x,y)\\) satisfy all three equations?\nThe examples in this introductory activity demonstrate several possible outcomes for the solutions to a set of linear equations. Notice that we are interested in points that satisfy each equation in the set and that these are seen as intersection points of the lines. Similar to the examples considered in the activity, three types of outcomes are seen in Figure 1.1.1.\nIn this figure, we see that\n* With a single equation, there are infinitely many points \\((x,y)\\) satisfying that equation.\n* Adding a second equation adds another condition we place on the points \\((x,y)\\) resulting in a single point that satisfies both equations.\n* Adding a third equation adds a third condition on the points \\((x,y)\\), and there is no point that satisfies all three equations.\nGenerally speaking, a single equation will have many solutions, in fact, infinitely many. As we add equations, we add conditions which lead, in a sense we will make precise later, to a smaller number of solutions. Eventually, we have too many equations and find there are no points that satisfy all of them.\n\n\n",

There are different ways in which we can represent colors, however, depending on whether a computer or a human will be processing the color. We will describe two of these representations, called _color models_, and demonstrate how they are used in the JPEG compression algorithm.\nDigital displays typically create colors by blending together various amounts of red, green, and blue. We can therefore describe a color by putting its constituent amounts of red, green, and blue into a vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}R\\\\ G\\\\ B\\end{array}\\right]\\). The quantities \\(R\\), \\(G\\), and \\(B\\) are each stored with one byte of information so they are integers between 0 and 255.

We call a basis orthogonal if the basis vectors are orthogonal to one another. However, a matrix is orthogonal if the columns are orthogonal to one another and have unit length.

Since these vectors are the columns of \\(A\\), we have \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)=W\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWhat is the rank of \\(A\\)?\nDescribe how to find an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nDescribe how to find an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nIf the columns of \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), what is \\(Q^{T}Q\\)?\nHow would you form a matrix that projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\)?\n### 7.5.1 Least-squares problems\nLeast-squares problems, which we explored in Section 6.5, arise when we are confronted with an inconsistent linear system \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\). Since there is no solution to the system, we instead find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) minimizing the distance between \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\). That is, we find the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}\\), the least-squares approximate solution, by solving \\(A\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto the column space of \\(A\\).\nIf we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\), then the number of nonzero singular values \\(r\\) tells us the rank of \\(A\\), and the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This basis may be used to project vectors onto \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) and hence to solve least-squares problems.\nBefore exploring this connection further, we will introduce Sage as a tool for automating the construction of singular value decompositions. One new feature is that we need to declare our matrix to consist of floating point entries. We do this by including RDF inside the matrix definition, as illustrated in the following cell.\n\n\n",
