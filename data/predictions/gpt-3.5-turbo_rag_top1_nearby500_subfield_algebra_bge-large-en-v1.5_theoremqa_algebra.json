This exercise is about balancing chemical reactions. 1. Chemists denote a molecule of water as H\\({}_{2}\\)O, which means it is composed of two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O). The process by which hydrogen burns is described by the chemical reaction \\[x\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}+y\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\to z\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\\] This means that \\(x\\) molecules of hydrogen H\\({}_{2}\\) combine with \\(y\\) molecules of oxygen O\\({}_{2}\\) to produce \\(z\\) water molecules. The number of hydrogen atoms is the same before and after the reaction; the same is true of the oxygen atoms. 1. In terms of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), how many hydrogen atoms are there before the reaction? How many hydrogen atoms are there after the reaction? Find a linear equation in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) by equating these quantities. 2. Find a second linear equation in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) by equating the number of oxygen atoms before and after the reaction. 3. Find the solutions of this linear system. Why are there infinitely many solutions? 4. In this chemical setting, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) should be positive integers. Find the solution where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are the smallest possible positive integers. 2. Now consider the reaction where potassium permanganate and manganese sulfate combine with water to produce manganese dioxide, potassium sulfate, and sulfuric acid: \\[x_{1}\\,\\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}+x_{2}\\,\\mathrm{MnO}_{4}+x_{3}\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O }\\to x_{4}\\,\\mathrm{MnO}_{2}+x_{5}\\,\\mathrm{K}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}+x_{6}\\, \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{SO}_{4}.\\] As in the previous exercise, find the appropriate values for \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{6}\\) to balance the chemical reaction.\n6. We began this section by stating that increasing computational power has helped linear algebra assume a prominent role as a scientific tool. Later, we looked at one computa\ntional limitation: once a matrix gets to be too big, it is not reasonable to apply Gaussian elimination to find its reduced row echelon form. In this exercise, we will see another limitation: computer arithmetic with real numbers is only an approximation because computers represent real numbers with only a finite number of bits. For instance, the number pi \\[\\pi=3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399\\ldots\\] would be approximated inside a computer by, say, \\[\\pi\\approx 3.141592653589793\\] Most of the time, this is not a problem. However, when we perform millions or even billions of arithmetic operations, the error in these approximations starts to accumulate and can lead to results that are wildly inaccurate. Here are two examples demonstrating this. 1. Let's first see an example showing that computer arithmetic really is an approximation. First, consider the linear system \\[x+\\frac{1}{2}y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+\\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] If the coefficients are entered into Sage as fractions, Sage will find the exact reduced row echelon form. Find the exact solution to this linear system.\nNow let's ask Sage to compute with real numbers. We can do this by representing one of the coefficients as a decimal. For instance, the same linear system can be represented as\n\\[x+0.5y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+ \\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+ \\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] Most computers do arithmetic using either 32 or 64 bits. To magnify the problem so that we can see it better, we will ask Sage to do arithmetic using only 10 bits as follows.\n``` R=RealNumber RealNumber=RealField(10)\n#ent\nWhat does Sage give for the solution now? Compare this to the exact solution that you found previously.\n2. Some types of linear systems are particularly sensitive to errors resulting from computers' approximate arithmetic. For instance, suppose we are interested in the linear system \\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2\\] Find the solution to this linear system.\nSuppose now that the computer has accumulated some error in one of the entries of this system so that it incorrectly stores the system as\n\\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2.001\\]\nFind the solution to this linear system.\nNotice how a small error in one of the entries in the linear system leads to a solution that has a dramatically large error. Fortunately, this is an issue that has been well studied, and there are techniques that mitigate this type of behavior.\n## Chapter 1 Systems of Equations\n\n\n",

In fact, Proposition 2.5.6 tells us how to form \\(A\\); we simply write\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nWe will now check that \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) using the linearity of \\(T\\):\n\\[T(\\mathbf{x})=T\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=T(x_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+ x_{n}\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=x_{1}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})+x_{2}T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})+\\ldots+x_{n}T(\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=x_{1}A\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}A\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+x_{n}A\\mathbf{e}_{n}\\]\n\\[=A(x_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2}+\\ldots+x_{n}\\mathbf{e}_{n})\\]\n\\[=A\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\\[=A\\mathbf{x}\\]\nThe result is the following proposition.\n**Proposition 2.6.3**_The function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) is a matrix transformation where \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) for some \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) if and only if_\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\n_In this case, \\(A\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{j})\\); that is,_\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})&\\ldots&T( \\mathbf{e}_{n})\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSaid simply, this proposition means says that if have a function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and can verify the two linearity properties stated in the proposition, then we know that \\(T\\) is a matrix transformation. Let's see how this works in practice.\n**Example 2.6.4** We will consider the function \\(T:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that rotates a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) in the counterclockwise direction to obtain \\(T(\\mathbf{x})\\) as seen in Figure 2.6.5.\nWe first need to know that \\(T\\) can be represented by a matrix transformation, which means, by Proposition 2.6.3, that we need to verify the linearity properties:\n\\[T(c\\mathbf{v}) =cT(\\mathbf{v})\\] \\[T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}) =T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w}).\\]\nThe next two figures illustrate why these properties hold. For instance, Figure 2.6.6 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) when \\(c\\) is a scalar. In particular, scaling a vector and then rotating it is the same as rotating and then scaling it, which means that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nSimilarly, Figure 2.6.7 shows the relationship between \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\). Remember that the sum of two vectors is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors. The rotation \\(T\\) has the effect of rotating the parallelogram defined by \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) into the parallelogram defined by \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{w})\\), explaining why \\(T(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})=T(\\mathbf{v})+T(\\mathbf{w})\\).\nFigure 2.6.5: The function \\(T\\) rotates a vector counterclockwise by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\nFigure 2.6.6: We see that the vector \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})\\) is a scalar multiple to \\(T(\\mathbf{v})\\) so that \\(T(c\\mathbf{v})=cT(\\mathbf{v})\\).\nHaving verified these two properties, we now know that the function \\(T\\) that rotates vectors by \\(45^{\\circ}\\) is a matrix transformation. We may therefore write it as \\(T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}\\) where \\(A\\) is the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})&T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\end{array}\\right]\\). The columns of this matrix, \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{2})\\), are shown on the right of Figure 2.6.8.\nNotice that \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\) forms an isosceles right triangle, as shown in Figure 2.6.9. Since the length of \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) is \\(1\\), the length of \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_{1})\\), the hypotenuse of the triangle, is also \\(1\\), and by Pythagoras' theorem, the lengths of its legs are \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nFigure 2.6.8: The matrix transformation \\(T\\) rotates \\(\\mathbf{e}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_{2}\\) by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\n\n\n",

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2.

What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\n\n",

In the same way, we find that a basis for the eigenspace \\(E_{2}\\) is \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\).\nWe note that, for this matrix, it is possible to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) consisting of eigenvectors, namely,\n\\[\\mathcal{B}=\\left\\{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\right\\}.\\]\n**Example 4.2.5** Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&1\\\\ -1&3\\end{array}\\right]\\) whose characteristic equation is\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=\\lambda^{2}-4\\lambda+4=(\\lambda-2)^{2}=0.\\]\nThere is a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=2\\), and we find that\n\\[A-2\\lambda=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-1&1\\\\ -1&1\\end{array}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&-1\\\\ 0&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTherefore, the eigenspace \\(E_{2}=\\operatorname{Nul}(A-2I)\\) is one-dimensional with a basis vector \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\).\n**Example 4.2.6** If \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-1&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{array}\\right]\\), then\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda+1)^{2}=0,\\]\nwhich implies that there is a single eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\). We find that\n\\[A-(-1)I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich says that every two-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) satisfies \\((A-(-1)I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). Therefore, every vector is an eigenvector and so \\(E_{-1}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\). This eigenspace is two-dimensional.\nWe can see this in another way. The matrix transformation defined by \\(A\\) rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\), which says that \\(A\\mathbf{x}=-\\mathbf{x}\\) for every vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In other words, every two-dimensional vector is an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda=-1\\).\nThese last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when there is a single eigenvalue.\nIn one case, we are able to construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) using eigenvectors; in the other, we are not. We will explore this behavior more in the next subsection.\n**A check on our work.**\nWhen finding eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the characteristic equation. If \\(\\lambda\\) is a solution to the characteristic equation, then \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible and, consequently, \\(A-\\lambda I\\) must contain a row without a pivot position.\nThis serves as a check on our work. If we row reduce \\(A-\\lambda I\\) and find the identity matrix, then we have made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or in finding \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A-\\lambda I)\\).\n#### The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of eigenspaces\nGiven a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), we saw in the previous section the value of being able to express any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) as a linear combination of eigenvectors of \\(A\\). For this reason, Question 4.1.8 asks when we can construct a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. We will explore this question more fully now.\nAs we saw above, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). The examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations\n* \\((4-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda)(3-\\lambda)=0\\), which has real and distinct roots,\n* \\((2-\\lambda)^{2}=0\\), which has repeated roots, and\n* \\(\\lambda^{2}+1=(i-\\lambda)(-i-\\lambda)=0\\), which has complex roots.\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, then the characteristic polynomial is a degree \\(n\\) polynomial, and this means that it has \\(n\\) roots. Therefore, the characteristic equation can be written as\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda)\\dots(\\lambda_{n }-\\lambda)=0\\]\ngiving eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), ..., \\(\\lambda_{n}\\). As we have seen, some of the eigenvalues may be complex. Moreover, some of the eigenvalues may appear in this list more than once. However, we can always write the characteristic equation in the form\n\n\n",

We then have \\(-2c_{1}+c_{2}=-13\\), which gives \\(c_{2}=3\\), and \\(c_{1}-c_{2}+c_{3}=8\\), which gives \\(c_{3}=3\\). Solving a triangular system is simplified because we only need to perform a sequence of substitutions.\nIn fact, solving an equation with an \\(n\\times n\\) triangular matrix requires approximately \\(\\frac{1}{2}n^{2}\\) operations. Once we have the factorization \\(A=LU\\), we solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) by solving two equations involving triangular matrices, which requires about \\(n^{2}\\) operations. For example, if \\(A\\) is a \\(1000\\times 1000\\) matrix, we solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) using about one million steps. The compares with roughly a billion operations needed to perform Gaussian elimination, which represents a significant savings. Of course, we have to first find the \\(LU\\) factorization of \\(A\\) and this requires roughly the same amount of work as performing Gaussian elimination. However, once we have the \\(LU\\) factorization, we can use it to solve \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) for different right hand sides \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\nOur discussion so far has ignored one issue, however. Remember that we sometimes have to perform row interchange operations in addition to row replacement. A typical row interchange is represented by multiplication by a matrix such as\n\\[P=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}0&0&1\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 1&0&0\\end{array}\\right],\\]\nwhich has the effect of interchanging the first and third rows. Notice that this matrix is not triangular so performing a row interchange will disrupt the structure of the \\(LU\\) factorization we seek. Without giving the details, we simply note that linear algebra software packages provide a matrix \\(P\\) that describes how the rows are permuted in the Gaussian elimination\nprocess. In particular, we will write \\(PA=LU\\), where \\(P\\) is a permutation matrix, \\(L\\) is lower triangular, and \\(U\\) is upper triangular.\nTherefore, to solve the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we first multiply both sides by \\(P\\) to obtain\n\\[PA\\mathbf{x}=LU\\mathbf{x}=P\\mathbf{b}.\\]\nThat is, we multiply \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) by \\(P\\) and then find \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) using the factorization: \\(L\\mathbf{c}=P\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(U\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{c}\\).\n**Activity 5.1.4**.: Sage will create \\(LU\\) factorizations; once we have a matrix \\(\\mathsf{A}\\), we write \\(\\mathsf{P}\\), \\(\\mathsf{L}\\), \\(\\mathsf{U}=\\mathsf{A}.\\mathsf{LU}()\\) to obtain the matrices \\(P\\), \\(L\\), and \\(U\\) such that \\(PA=LU\\).\n1. In Example 5.1.1, we found the \\(LU\\) factorization \\[A=\\begin{bmatrix}2&-3&1\\\\ -4&5&0\\\\ 2&-2&2\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\\\ -2&1&0\\\\ 1&-1&1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}2&-3&1\\\\ 0&-1&2\\\\ 0&0&3\\end{bmatrix}=LU.\\] Using Sage, define the matrix \\(A\\), and then ask Sage for the \\(LU\\) factorization. What are the matrices \\(P\\), \\(L\\), and \\(U\\)? Notice that Sage finds a different \\(LU\\) factorization than we found in the previous activity because Sage uses partial pivoting, as described in the previous section, when it performs Gaussian elimination.\n2.

Compare to the flop count for the naive method.\n_Remark_.: A further trick called the matrix inversion lemma (which is beyond the scope of this book) can be used to reduce the complexity of recursive least squares to order \\(mn^{2}\\).\n**12.15**: _Minimizing a squared norm plus an affine function._ A generalization of the least squares problem (12.1) adds an affine function to the least squares objective,\n\\[\\text{minimize}\\quad\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+c^{T}x+d,\\]\nwhere the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is the variable to be chosen, and the (given) data are the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\), the \\(n\\)-vector \\(c\\), and the number \\(d\\).

Algorithm 12.1 uses the QR factorization to compute the least squares approximate solution \\(\\hat{x}=A^{\\dagger}b\\), where the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) has linearly independent columns. It has a complexity of \\(2mn^{2}\\) flops. In this exercise we consider an alternative method: First, form the Gram matrix \\(G=A^{T}A\\) and the vector \\(h=A^{T}b\\); and then compute \\(\\hat{x}=G^{-1}h\\) (using algorithm 11.2). What is the complexity of this method? Compare it to algorithm 12.1. _Remark_. You might find that the Gram algorithm appears to be a bit faster than the QR method, but the factor is not large enough to have any practical significance. The idea is useful in situations where \\(G\\) is partially available and can be computed more efficiently than by multiplying \\(A\\) and its transpose.

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\n\n",

Suppose that \\[\\mathbf{w}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{w}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ -2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n2. Verify that \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\) form an orthogonal basis for a plane \\(W\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\n3. Use Proposition 6.3.15 to find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right]\\) onto \\(W\\).\n4. Find an orthonormal basis \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) for \\(W\\).\n5. Find the matrix \\(P\\) representing the matrix transformation that projects vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) orthogonally onto \\(W\\). Verify that \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=P\\mathbf{b}\\).\n6. Determine rank(\\(P\\)) and explain its geometric significance.\n7. Consider the vectors \\[\\mathbf{w}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{w}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{w}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ -2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\n8. Explain why these vectors form an orthogonal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\n9. Suppose that \\(A=\\left[\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\quad\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\quad\\mathbf{w}_{3}\\right]\\) and evaluate the product \\(A^{T}A\\). Why is this product a diagonal matrix and what is the significance of the diagonal entries?\n10. Express the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-3\\\\ -6\\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right]\\) as a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{w}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{w}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{w}_{3}\\).\n\n\n",

For each of the following geometric operations in the plane, find a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix that defines the matrix transformation performing the operation. 1. Rotates vectors by \\(180^{\\circ}\\). 2. Reflects vectors across the vertical axis. 3. Reflects vectors across the line \\(y=-x\\). 4. Rotates vectors counterclockwise by \\(60^{\\circ}\\). 5. First rotates vectors counterclockwise by \\(60^{\\circ}\\) and then reflects in the line \\(y=x\\).\n2. This exercise investigates the composition of reflections in the plane. 1. Find the result of first reflecting across the line \\(y=0\\) and then \\(y=x\\). What familiar operation is the cumulative effect of this composition? 2. What happens if you compose the operations in the opposite order; that is, what happens if you first reflect across \\(y=x\\) and then \\(y=0\\)? What familiar operation results? 3. What familiar geometric operation results if you first reflect across the line \\(y=x\\) and then \\(y=-x\\)? 4. What familiar geometric operation results if you first rotate by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) and then reflect across the line \\(y=x\\)? It is a general fact that the composition of two reflections results in a rotation through twice the angle from the first line of reflection to the second. We will investigate this more generally in Exercise 2.6.4.8\n3.

The constant term is omitted in the model because it would be redundant: It has the same effect as adding a constant to the parameters \\(\\theta_{2},\\ldots,\\theta_{P+1}\\).\nThe least squares fit is computed by minimizing \\(\\|A\\theta-y^{\\rm d}\\|^{2}\\) where \\(\\theta\\) is a \\((P+1)\\)-vector and the matrix \\(A\\) in (13.1) is given by\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\ 2&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ P&0&0&\\cdots&1\\\\ P+1&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\ P+2&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 2P&0&0&\\cdots&1\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots\\\\ N-P+1&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\ N-P+2&0&1&\\cdots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ N&0&0&\\cdots&1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn this example, \\(N=15P=180\\).

In this case the matrix \\(A\\) in (13.1) has the form\n\\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&x^{(1)}&\\cdots&(x^{(1)})^{p-1}\\\\ 1&x^{(2)}&\\cdots&(x^{(2)})^{p-1}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots\\\\ 1&x^{(N)}&\\cdots&(x^{(N)})^{p-1}\\end{array}\\right],\\]\n_i.e._, it is a Vandermonde matrix (see (6.7)). Its columns are linearly independent provided the numbers \\(x^{(1)},\\ldots,x^{(N)}\\) include at least \\(p\\) different values. Figure 13.6 shows an example of the least squares fit of polynomials of degree 2, 6, 10, and 15 to a set of 100 data points. Since any polynomial of degree less than \\(r\\) is also a polynomial of degree less than \\(s\\), for \\(r\\leq s\\), it follows that the RMS fit attained by a polynomial with a larger degree is smaller (or at least, no larger) than that obtained by a fit with a smaller degree polynomial. This suggests that we should use the largest degree polynomial that we can, since this results in the smallest residual and the best RMS fit. But we will see in SS13.2 that this is not true, and explore rational methods for choosing a model from among several candidates.\nPiecewise-linear fit.A _piecewise-linear_ function, with _knot points_ or _kink points_\\(a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{k}\\), is a continuous function that is affine in between the knot points. (Such functions should be called piecewise-affine.) We can describe any\nFigure 13.6: Least squares polynomial fits of degree 2, 6, 10, and 15 to 100 points.\npiecewise-linear function with \\(k\\) knot points using the \\(p=k+2\\) basis functions\n\\[f_{1}(x)=1,\\qquad f_{2}(x)=x,\\qquad f_{i+2}(x)=(x-a_{i})_{+},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,k,\\]\nwhere \\((u)_{+}=\\max\\{u,0\\}\\).

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\n\n",

Use cramer's rule to solve these three variables.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nFollowing standard mathematical language usage, we will say \"The vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly dependent\" to mean \"The list of vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) is linearly dependent\". But it must be remembered that linear dependence is an attribute of a _collection_ of vectors, and not individual vectors.\nLinearly independent vectors.A collection of \\(n\\)-vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) (with \\(k\\geq 1\\)) is called _linearly independent_ if it is not linearly dependent, which means that\n\\[\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{k}a_{k}=0\\] (5.1)\nonly holds for \\(\\beta_{1}=\\cdots=\\beta_{k}=0\\). In other words, the only linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector is the linear combination with all coefficients zero.\nAs with linear dependence, we will say \"The vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly independent\" to mean \"The list of vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) is linearly independent\". But, like linear dependence, linear independence is an attribute of a collection of vectors, and not individual vectors.\nIt is generally not easy to determine by casual inspection whether or not a list of vectors is linearly dependent or linearly independent. But we will soon see an algorithm that does this.\n#### Examples.\n* A list consisting of a single vector is linearly dependent only if the vector is zero. It is linearly independent only if the vector is nonzero.\n* Any list of vectors containing the zero vector is linearly dependent.\n* A list of two vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors is a multiple of the other one. More generally, a list of vectors is linearly dependent if any one of the vectors is a multiple of another one.\n* The vectors \\[a_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.2\\\\ -7.0\\\\ 8.6\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-0.1\\\\ 2.0\\\\ -1.0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.0\\\\ -1.0\\\\ 2.2\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly dependent, since \\(a_{1}+2a_{2}-3a_{3}=0\\). We can express any of these vectors as a linear combination of the other two. For example, we have \\(a_{2}=(-1/2)a_{1}+(3/2)a_{3}\\).\n* The vectors \\[a_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ -1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad a_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}-1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] are linearly independent. To see this, suppose \\(\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\beta_{2}a_{2}+\\beta_{3}a_{3}=0\\). This means that \\[\\beta_{1}-\\beta_{3}=0,\\qquad-\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}=0,\\qquad\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}=0.\\] Adding the last two equations we find that \\(2\\beta_{3}=-0\\), so \\(\\beta_{3}=0\\). Using this, the first equation is then \\(\\beta_{1}=0\\), and the second equation is \\(\\beta_{2}=0\\).\n* The standard unit \\(n\\)-vectors \\(e_{1},\\ldots,e_{n}\\) are linearly independent. To see this, suppose that (5.1) holds. We have \\[0=\\beta_{1}e_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{n}e_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\beta_{1}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_{n}\\end{array}\\right],\\] so we conclude that \\(\\beta_{1}=\\cdots=\\beta_{n}=0\\).\nLinear combinations of linearly independent vectors.Suppose a vector \\(x\\) is a linear combination of \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\),\n\\[x=\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{k}a_{k}.\\]\nWhen the vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly independent, the coefficients that form \\(x\\) are _unique_: If we also have\n\\[x=\\gamma_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\gamma_{k}a_{k},\\]\nthen \\(\\beta_{i}=\\gamma_{i}\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots,k\\). This tells us that, in principle at least, we can find the coefficients that form a vector \\(x\\) as a linear combination of linearly independent vectors.\nTo see this, we subtract the two equations above to get\n\\[0=(\\beta_{1}-\\gamma_{1})a_{1}+\\cdots+(\\beta_{k}-\\gamma_{k})a_{k}.\\]\nSince \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) are linearly independent, we conclude that \\(\\beta_{i}-\\gamma_{i}\\) are all zero.\nThe converse is also true: If each linear combination of a list of vectors can only be expressed as a linear combination with one set of coefficients, then the list of vectors is linearly independent. This gives a nice interpretation of linear independence: A list of vectors is linearly independent if and only if for any linear combination of them, we can infer or deduce the associated coefficients.

Of course, one of the examples in the activity shows that there are exceptions to this simple rule, as seen in Figure 1.1.2. For instance, two equations in two unknowns may correspond to parallel lines so that the set of equations has no solutions. It may also happen that a set of three equations in two unknowns has a single solution.

How do the left singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{i}\\) provide an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\)?\n* Remember that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) is the dimension of the column space. What is \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\) and how do the number of nonzero singular values determine \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)\\)?\nThis activity shows how a singular value decomposition of a matrix encodes important information about its null and column spaces. More specifically, the left and right singular vectors provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). This is one of the reasons that singular value decompositions are so useful.\n**Example 7.4.7** Suppose we have a singular value decomposition \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\) where \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sigma_{2}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\sigma_{3}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\). This means that \\(A\\) has four rows and five columns just as \\(\\Sigma\\) does.\nAs in the activity, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\), we have\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is in \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must have the form\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3},\\]\nwhich says that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{3}\\). These three vectors therefore form a basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\). In fact, since they are columns in the orthogonal matrix \\(U\\), they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nRemembering that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\dim\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\), we see that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=3\\), which results from the three nonzero singular values. In general, the rank \\(r\\) of a matrix \\(A\\) equals the number of nonzero singular values, and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{r}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\).\nMoreover, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+\\ldots+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) satisfies \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\), then\n\\[A\\mathbf{x}=\\sigma_{1}c_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}+\\sigma_{2}c_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}+ \\sigma_{3}c_{3}\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\mathbf{0},\\]\nwhich implies that \\(c_{1}=0\\), \\(c_{2}=0\\), and \\(c_{3}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{x}=c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}+c_{5}\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) so \\(\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{5}\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nMore generally, if \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix and if \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\\), the last \\(n-r\\) right singular vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\).\nGenerally speaking, if the rank of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), then there are \\(r\\) nonzero singular values and \\(\\Sigma\\) has the form\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\\sigma_{1}&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&\\sigma_{r}&\\ldots&0\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\ 0&\\ldots&0&\\ldots&0\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nThe first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\):\n\\[U=\\left[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{r}}_{\\operatorname{Col}(A)} \\ \\mathbf{u}_{r+1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{u}_{m}\\right]\\]\nand the last \\(n-r\\) columns of \\(V\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A)\\):\n\\[V=\\left[\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{r}\\ \\underbrace{\\mathbf{v}_{r+1} \\ \\ldots\\ \\mathbf{v}_{n}}_{\\operatorname{Nul}(A)}\\right]\\]\nRemember that Proposition 7.4.6 says that \\(A\\) and its transpose \\(A^{T}\\) share the same singular values. Since the rank of a matrix equals its number of nonzero singular values, this means that \\(\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T})\\), a fact that we cited back in Section 6.2.\n**Proposition 7.4.8**: _For any matrix \\(A\\),_\n\\[\\operatorname{rank}(A)=\\operatorname{rank}(A^{T}).\\]\nIf we have a singular value decomposition of an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A=U\\Sigma V^{T}\\), Proposition 7.4.6 also tells us that the left singular vectors of \\(A\\) are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). Therefore, \\(U\\) is the \\(m\\times m\\) matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors of \\(A^{T}\\). This means that the last \\(m-r\\) vectors form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\). Therefore, the columns of \\(U\\) provide orthonormal bases for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Nul}(A^{T})\\):\n\n\n",

What is |A|?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIn the basic least squares problem, we seek \\(x\\) that minimizes the objective function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\). We now add _constraints_ to this problem, by insisting that \\(x\\) satisfy the linear equations \\(Cx=d\\), where the matrix \\(C\\) and the vector \\(d\\) are given. The _linearly constrained least squares problem_ (or just constrained least squares problem) is written as\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&Cx=d.\\end{array}\\] (16.1)\nHere \\(x\\), the variable to be found, is an \\(n\\)-vector. The problem data (which are given) are the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the \\(m\\)-vector \\(b\\), the \\(p\\times n\\) matrix \\(C\\), and the \\(p\\)-vector \\(d\\).\nWe refer to the function \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) as the _objective_ of the problem, and the set of \\(p\\) linear equality constraints \\(Cx=d\\) as the _constraints_ of the problem. They can be written out as \\(p\\) scalar constraints (equations)\n\\[c_{i}^{T}x=d_{i},\\quad i=1,\\ldots,p,\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i}^{T}\\) is the \\(i\\)th row of \\(C\\).\nAn \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is called _feasible_ (for the problem (16.1)) if it satisfies the constraints, _i.e._, \\(Cx=d\\). An \\(n\\)-vector \\(\\hat{x}\\) is called an _optimal point_ or _solution_ of the optimization problem (16.1) if it is feasible, and if \\(\\|A\\hat{x}-b\\|^{2}\\leq\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) holds for any feasible \\(x\\). In other words, \\(\\hat{x}\\) solves the problem (16.1) if it is feasible and has the smallest possible value of the objective function among all feasible vectors.\nThe constrained least squares problem combines the problems of solving a set of linear equations (find \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(Cx=d\\)) with the least squares problem\n(find \\(x\\) that minimizes \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\)). Indeed each of these problems can be considered a special case of the constrained least squares problem (16.1).\nThe constrained least squares problem can also be thought of as a limit of a bi-objective least squares problem, with primary objective \\(\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}\\) and secondary objective \\(\\|Cx-d\\|^{2}\\). Roughly speaking, we put infinite weight on the second objective, so that any nonzero value is unacceptable (which forces \\(x\\) to satisfy \\(Cx=d\\)). So we would expect (and it can be verified) that minimizing the weighted objective\n\\[\\|Ax-b\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|Cx-d\\|^{2},\\]\nfor a very large value of \\(\\lambda\\) yields a vector close to a solution of the constrained least squares problem (16.1). We will encounter this idea again in chapter 19, when we consider the nonlinear constrained least squares problem.\nExample.In figure 16.1 we fit a _piecewise-polynomial_ function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) to a set of \\(N=140\\) points \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) in the plane. The function \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is defined as\n\\[\\hat{f}(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}p(x)&x\\leq a\\\\ q(x)&x>a,\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nwith \\(a\\) given, and \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) polynomials of degree three or less,\n\\[p(x)=\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}x+\\theta_{3}x^{2}+\\theta_{4}x^{3},\\qquad q(x)=\\theta _{5}+\\theta_{6}x+\\theta_{7}x^{2}+\\theta_{8}x^{3}.\\]\nWe also impose the condition that \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\), so that \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) is continuous and has a continuous first derivative at \\(x=a\\). Suppose the \\(N\\) data\nFigure 16.1: Least squares fit of two cubic polynomials to 140 points, with continuity constraints \\(p(a)=q(a)\\) and \\(p^{\\prime}(a)=q^{\\prime}(a)\\).\npoints \\((x_{i},y_{i})\\) are numbered so that \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{M}\\leq a\\) and \\(x_{M+1},\\ldots,x_{N}>a\\).

A similar notation is \\(a/2\\), where \\(a\\) is a vector, meaning \\((1/2)a\\). The scalar-vector product \\((-1)a\\) is written simply as \\(-a\\). Note that \\(0\\,a=0\\) (where the left-hand zero is the scalar zero, and the right-hand zero is a vector zero of the same size as \\(a\\)).\nProperties.By definition, we have \\(\\alpha a=a\\alpha\\), for any scalar \\(\\alpha\\) and any vector \\(a\\). This is called the _commutative property_ of scalar-vector multiplication; it means that scalar-vector multiplication can be written in either order.\nFigure 1.9: Average monthly rainfall in inches measured in downtown Los Angeles and San Francisco International Airport, and their sum. Averages are 30-year averages (1981–2010).\nScalar multiplication obeys several other laws that are easy to figure out from the definition. For example, it satisfies the associative property: If \\(a\\) is a vector and \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, we have\n\\[(\\beta\\gamma)a=\\beta(\\gamma a).\\]\nOn the left-hand side we see scalar-scalar multiplication (\\(\\beta\\gamma\\)) and scalar-vector multiplication; on the right-hand side we see two scalar-vector products. As a consequence, we can write the vector above as \\(\\beta\\gamma a\\), since it does not matter whether we interpret this as \\(\\beta(\\gamma a)\\) or \\((\\beta\\gamma)a\\).\nThe associative property holds also when we denote scalar-vector multiplication with the scalar on the right. For example, we have \\(\\beta(\\gamma a)=(\\beta a)\\gamma\\), and consequently we can write both as \\(\\beta a\\gamma\\). As a convention, however, this vector is normally written as \\(\\beta\\gamma a\\) or as \\((\\beta\\gamma)a\\).\nIf \\(a\\) is a vector and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) are scalars, then\n\\[(\\beta+\\gamma)a=\\beta a+\\gamma a.\\]\n(This is the left-distributive property of scalar-vector multiplication.) Scalar multiplication, like ordinary multiplication, has higher precedence in equations than vector addition, so the right-hand side here, \\(\\beta a+\\gamma a\\), means \\((\\beta a)+(\\gamma a)\\). It is useful to identify the symbols appearing in this formula above. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right denotes vector addition. When scalar multiplication is written with the scalar on the right, we have the right-distributive property:\n\\[a(\\beta+\\gamma)=a\\beta+a\\gamma.\\]\nScalar-vector multiplication also satisfies another version of the right-distributive property:\n\\[\\beta(a+b)=\\beta a+\\beta b\\]\nfor any scalar \\(\\beta\\) and any \\(n\\)-vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this equation, both of the \\(+\\) symbols refer to the addition of \\(n\\)-vectors.\nExamples.\n* _Displacements._ When a vector \\(a\\) represents a displacement, and \\(\\beta>0\\), \\(\\beta a\\) is a displacement in the same direction of \\(a\\), with its magnitude scaled by \\(\\beta\\). When \\(\\beta<0\\), \\(\\beta a\\) represents a displacement in the opposite direction of \\(a\\), with magnitude scaled by \\(|\\beta|\\). This is illustrated in figure 1.10.\n* _Materials requirements._ Suppose the \\(n\\)-vector \\(q\\) is the bill of materials for producing one unit of some product, _i.e._, \\(q_{i}\\) is the amount of raw material required to produce one unit of product. To produce \\(\\alpha\\) units of the product will then require raw materials given by \\(\\alpha q\\). (Here we assume that \\(\\alpha\\geq 0\\).)\n* _Audio scaling._ If \\(a\\) is a vector representing an audio signal, the scalar-vector product \\(\\beta a\\) is perceived as the same audio signal, but changed in volume (loudness) by the factor \\(|\\beta|\\). For example, when \\(\\beta=1/2\\) (or \\(\\beta=-1/2\\)), \\(\\beta a\\) is perceived as the same audio signal, but quieter.\nLinear combinations.If \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{m}\\) are \\(n\\)-vectors, and \\(\\beta_{1},\\ldots,\\beta_{m}\\) are scalars, the \\(n\\)-vector\n\\[\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{m}a_{m}\\]\n\n\n",

Compute $(x_1/(x_2 + 1))^2 + (x_2 / (x_1 + 1))^2$.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow suppose that \\(x\\) is any \\(n\\)-vector. It can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\):\n\\[x=\\beta_{1}a_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{n}a_{n}.\\]\nThe dual basis gives us a simple way to find the coefficients \\(\\beta_{1},\\ldots,\\beta_{n}\\).\nWe start with \\(AB=I\\), and multiply by \\(x\\) to get\n\\[x=ABx=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}a_{1}&\\cdots&a_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}b_{1}^{T}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ b_{n}^{T}\\end{array}\\right]x=(b_{1}^{T}x)a_{1}+\\cdots+(b_{n}^{T}x)a_{n}.\\]\nThis means (since the vectors \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\) are linearly independent) that \\(\\beta_{i}=b_{i}^{T}x\\). In words: The coefficients in the expansion of a vector in a basis are given by the inner products with the dual basis vectors. Using matrix notation, we can say that \\(\\beta=B^{T}x=(A^{-1})^{T}x\\) is the vector of coefficients of \\(x\\) in the basis given by the columns of \\(A\\).\nAs a simple numerical example, consider the basis\n\\[a_{1}=(1,1),\\qquad a_{2}=(1,-1).\\]\nThe dual basis consists of the rows of \\([\\begin{array}{cc}a_{1}&a_{2}\\end{array}]^{-1}\\), which are\n\\[b_{1}^{T}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/2&1/2\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad b_{2}^{T }=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/2&-1/2\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nTo express the vector \\(x=(-5,1)\\) as a linear combination of \\(a_{1}\\) and \\(a_{2}\\), we have\n\\[x=(b_{1}^{T}x)a_{1}+(b_{2}^{T}x)a_{2}=(-2)a_{1}+(-3)a_{2},\\]\nwhich can be directly verified.\nNegative matrix powers.We can now give a meaning to matrix powers with negative integer exponents. Suppose \\(A\\) is a square invertible matrix and \\(k\\) is a positive integer. Then by repeatedly applying property (11.2), we get\n\\[(A^{k})^{-1}=(A^{-1})^{k}.\\]\nWe denote this matrix as \\(A^{-k}\\). For example, if \\(A\\) is square and invertible, then \\(A^{-2}=A^{-1}A^{-1}=(AA)^{-1}\\). With \\(A^{0}\\) defined as \\(A^{0}=I\\), the identity \\(A^{k+l}=A^{k}A^{l}\\) holds for all integers \\(k\\) and \\(l\\).\nTriangular matrix.A triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. We first discuss this for a lower triangular matrix. Let \\(L\\) be \\(n\\times n\\) and lower triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. We show that the columns are linearly independent, _i.e._, \\(Lx=0\\) is only possible if \\(x=0\\). Expanding the matrix-vector product, we can write \\(Lx=0\\) as\n\\[L_{11}x_{1} = 0\\] \\[L_{21}x_{1}+L_{22}x_{2} = 0\\] \\[L_{31}x_{1}+L_{32}x_{2}+L_{33}x_{3} = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[L_{n1}x_{1}+L_{n2}x_{2}+\\cdots+L_{n,n-1}x_{n-1}+L_{nn}x_{n} = 0.\\]\nSince \\(L_{11}\\neq 0\\), the first equation implies \\(x_{1}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=0\\), the second equation reduces to \\(L_{22}x_{2}=0\\). Since \\(L_{22}\\neq 0\\), we conclude that \\(x_{2}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=x_{2}=0\\), the third equation now reduces to \\(L_{33}x_{3}=0\\), and since \\(L_{33}\\) is assumed to be nonzero, we have \\(x_{3}=0\\). Continuing this argument, we find that all entries of \\(x\\) are zero, and this shows that the columns of \\(L\\) are linearly independent. It follows that \\(L\\) is invertible.\nA similar argument can be followed to show that an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. One can also simply note that if \\(R\\) is upper triangular, then \\(L=R^{T}\\) is lower triangular with the same diagonal, and use the formula \\((L^{T})^{-1}=(L^{-1})^{T}\\) for the inverse of the transpose.\nInverse via QR factorization.The QR factorization gives a simple expression for the inverse of an invertible matrix. If \\(A\\) is square and invertible, its columns are linearly independent, so it has a QR factorization \\(A=QR\\). The matrix \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. Hence \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are invertible, and the formula for the inverse product gives\n\\[A^{-1}=(QR)^{-1}=R^{-1}Q^{-1}=R^{-1}Q^{T}.\\] (11.3)\nIn the following section we give an algorithm for computing \\(R^{-1}\\), or more directly, the product \\(R^{-1}Q^{T}\\). This gives us a method to compute the matrix inverse.\n\n\n",

We found that with\n* one pivot position, the span was a line.\n* two pivot positions, the span was a plane.\n* three pivot positions, the span was \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).\nThough we will return to these ideas later, for now take note of the fact that the span of a set of vectors in \\(\\mathbf{R}^{3}\\) is a relatively simple, familiar geometric object.\nThe reasoning that led us to conclude that the span of a set of vectors is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) when the associated matrix has a pivot position in every row applies more generally.\n**Proposition 2.3.14**: _Suppose we have vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). Then \\(\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\}=\\mathbf{ R}^{m}\\) if and only if the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\cdots&\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\end{array}\\right]\\) has a pivot position in every row._\nThis tells us something important about the number of vectors needed to span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). Suppose we have \\(n\\) vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) that span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). The proposition tells us that the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\\mathbf{v}_{1}&\\mathbf{v}_{2}&\\ldots&\\mathbf{v}_ {n}\\end{array}\\right]\\) has a pivot position in every row, such as in this reduced row echelon matrix.\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc}1&0&*&0&*&0\\\\ 0&1&*&0&*&0\\\\ 0&0&0&1&*&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nSince a matrix can have at most one pivot position in a column, there must be at least as many columns as there are rows, which implies that \\(n\\geq m\\). For instance, if we have a set of vectors that span \\(\\mathbb{R}^{632}\\), there must be at least 632 vectors in the set.\n**Proposition 2.3.15**_A set of vectors whose span is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) contains at least \\(m\\) vectors._\nWe have thought about a linear combination of a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) as the result of walking a certain distance in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), followed by walking a certain distance in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and so on. If \\(\\mathrm{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\}=\\mathbb{ R}^{m}\\), this means that we can walk to every point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) using the directions \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\). Intuitively, this proposition is telling us that we need at least \\(m\\) directions to have the flexibility needed to reach every point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\n**Terminology.**\nBecause span is a concept that is connected to a set of vectors, we say, \"The span of the set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\) is ...\" While it may be tempting to say, \"The span of the matrix \\(A\\) is ...,\" we should instead say \"The span of the columns of the matrix \\(A\\) is ...\"\n#### Summary\nWe defined the span of a set of vectors and developed some intuition for this concept through a series of examples.\n\n\n",

A basis of \\(S\\) is a linearly independent set of vectors whose span is \\(S\\).\n* If \\(A\\) is an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix, the column space \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is the span of the columns of \\(A\\) and forms a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\n* A basis for \\(\\operatorname{Col}(A)\\) is found from the columns of \\(A\\) that have pivot positions.

Therefore,\n\\[\\mathbf{u}=\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{w}|}\\mathbf{w}\\]\nbecomes a unit vector parallel to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\nOrthogonal sets in which the vectors have unit length are called _orthonormal_ and are especially convenient.\n**Definition 6.3.6** An _orthonormal_ set is an orthogonal set of vectors each of which has unit length.\n**Example 6.3.7** The vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{array}\\right],\\hskip 28.452756pt\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c}-1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nare an orthonormal set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) and form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\).\nIf we form the matrix\n\\[Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}1/ \\sqrt{2}&-1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\end{bmatrix},\\]\nwe find that \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\) since Proposition 6.2.8 tells us that\n\\[Q^{T}Q=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\\\ \\mathbf{u}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{1}&\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThe previous activity and example illustrate the next proposition.\n**Proposition 6.3.8**_If the columns of the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(Q\\) form an orthonormal set, then \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix._\n#### Orthogonal projections\nWe now turn to an important problem that will appear in many forms in the rest of our explorations. Suppose, as shown in Figure 6.3.9, that we have a subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that is not in that subspace. We would like to find the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) in \\(W\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), meaning the distance between \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is as small as possible.\n**Figure 6.3.9** Given a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) not in the plane, we wish to find the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) in the plane that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\nTo get started, let's consider a simpler problem where we have a line \\(L\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), defined by the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), and another vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that is not on the line, as shown on the left of Figure 6.3.10. We wish to find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), the vector on the line that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), as illustrated in the right of Figure 6.3.10.\n**Figure 6.3.10** Given a line \\(L\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), we seek the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) on \\(L\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\nTo find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), we require that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) be orthogonal to \\(L\\). For instance, if \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is another vector on the line, as shown in Figure 6.3.11, then the Pythagorean theorem implies that\n\\[|\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{y}|^{2}=|\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}|^{2}+|\\widehat{ \\mathbf{b}}-\\mathbf{y}|^{2}\\]\nwhich means that \\(|\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{y}|\\geq|\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}|\\). Therefore, \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is closer to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) than any other vector on the line \\(L\\).\n**Definition 6.3.12** Given a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and a subspace \\(W\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), the _orthogonal projection_ of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) is the vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) in \\(W\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). It is characterized by the property that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is orthogonal to \\(W\\).\n**Activity 6.3.3.** This activity demonstrates how to determine the orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\).\nLet's begin by considering a line \\(L\\), defined by the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\), and a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right]\\) not on \\(L\\), as illustrated in Figure 6.3.13.\n**Figure 6.3.13** Finding the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto the line defined by \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\n1. To find \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), first notice that \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=s\\mathbf{w}\\) for some scalar \\(s\\). Since \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=\\mathbf{b}-s\\mathbf{w}\\) is\northogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), what do we know about the dot product \\[(\\mathbf{b}-s\\mathbf{w})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}?\\]\n\n\n",

It requires considerable effort to compute, and we can solve any equation of the form \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) using an \\(LU\\) factorization, which means that the inverse isn't necessary.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nConsider the matrix of A=[[1, 4], [4, 1]], is this a positive definite matrix?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWe've been focused on finding the directions in which a quadratic form attains its maximum and minimum values, but there's another important observation to make after this activity. Recall how we used the fact that a symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable: if \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\), then \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{u})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{v})\\) where \\(\\mathbf{v}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{u}\\).\nMore generally, if we define \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), we have\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(QDQ^{T}\\mathbf{ x})=(Q^{T}\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(DQ^{T}\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{y}\\cdot(D\\mathbf{y})=q_{D}( \\mathbf{y})\\]\nRemembering that the quadratic form associated to a diagonal form has no cross terms, we obtain\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{y})=\\lambda_{1}y_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}y_{2}^{2}+ \\ldots+\\lambda_{m}y_{m}^{2}.\\]\nIn other words, after a change of coordinates, the quadratic form \\(q_{A}\\) can be written without cross terms. This is known as the Principle Axes Theorem.\n**Theorem 7.2.10**: **Principle Axes Theorem.** _If \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(m\\times m\\) matrix with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\lambda_{m}\\), then the quadratic form \\(q_{A}\\) can be written, after an orthogonal change of coordinates \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), as_\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\lambda_{1}y_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}y_{2}^{2}+\\ldots+\\lambda_{m }y_{m}^{2}.\\]\nWe will put this to use in the next section.\n#### Definite symmetric matrices\nWhile our questions about variance provide some motivation for exploring quadratic forms, these functions appear in a variety of other contexts so it's worth spending some more time with them. For example, quadratic forms appear in multivariable calculus when describing the behavior of a function of several variables near a critical point and in physics when describing the kinetic energy of a rigid body.\nFigure 7.2.9: The demeaned data from Preview Activity 7.2.1 is shown projected onto the lines of maximal and minimal variance.\nThe following definition will be important in this section.\n**Definition 7.2.11** A symmetric matrix \\(A\\) is called _positive definite_ if its associated quadratic form satisfies \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for any nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). If \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we say that \\(A\\) is _positive semidefinite_.\nLikewise, we say that \\(A\\) is _negative definite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nFinally, \\(A\\) is called _indefinite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for some \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for others.\n**Activity 7.2.4.** This activity explores the relationship between the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix and its definiteness.\n1. Consider the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{bmatrix}\\) and write its quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in terms of the components of \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). How does this help you decide whether \\(D\\) is positive definite or not?\n2. Now consider \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\) and write its quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in terms of \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\). What can you say about the definiteness of \\(D\\)?\n3. If \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix, what condition on the diagonal entries guarantee that \\(D\\) is 1. positive definite? 2. positive semidefinite? 3. negative definite? 4. negative semidefinite? 5. indefinite?\n4. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 4 and 2 so that \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\) where \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{bmatrix}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), then we have \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{y})\\). Explain why this tells us that \\(A\\) is positive definite.\n5. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 4 and 0. What can you say about the definiteness of \\(A\\) in this case?\n6.

Consider the symmetric matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\). Write the quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) defined by \\(D\\) in terms of the components of \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is the value of \\(q_{D}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -4\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\)?\n2. Given the symmetric matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}2&5\\\\ 5&-3\\end{bmatrix}\\), write the quadratic form \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) de\nfined by \\(A\\) and evaluate \\(q_{A}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\).\n3. Suppose that \\(q\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=3x_{1}^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}+4x_{2}^{2}\\). Find a symmetric matrix \\(A\\) such that \\(q\\) is the quadratic form defined by \\(A\\).\n4. Suppose that \\(q\\) is a quadratic form and that \\(q(\\mathbf{x})=3\\). What is \\(q(2\\mathbf{x})\\)? \\(q(-\\mathbf{x})\\)? \\(q(10\\mathbf{x})\\)?\n5. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix and \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is the quadratic form defined by \\(A\\). Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) with associated eigenvalue -4 and with length 7. What is \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\)?\nLinear algebra is principally about things that are linear. However, quadratic forms, as the name implies, have a distinctly non-linear character. First, if \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\\\ b&c\\end{array}\\right]\\), is a symmetric matrix, then the associated quadratic form is\n\\[q_{A}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=ax_{1}^{2}+2bx_{1}x_{2}+cx_{2}^{2}.\\]\nNotice how the variables \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) are multiplied together, which tells us this isn't a linear function.\nThis expression assumes an especially simple form when \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix. In particular, if \\(D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&0\\\\ 0&c\\end{array}\\right]\\), then \\(q_{D}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)=ax_{1}^{2}+cx_{2}^{2}\\). This is special because there is no cross-term involving \\(x_{1}x_{2}\\).\nRemember that matrix transformations have the property that \\(T(s\\mathbf{x})=sT(\\mathbf{x})\\). Quadratic forms behave differently:\n\\[q_{A}(s\\mathbf{x})=(s\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(A(s\\mathbf{x}))=s^{2}\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A \\mathbf{x})=s^{2}q_{A}(\\mathbf{x}).\\]\nFor instance, when we multiply \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by the scalar 2, then \\(q_{A}(2\\mathbf{x})=4q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\). Also, notice that \\(q_{A}(-\\mathbf{x})=q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) since the scalar is squared.\nFinally, evaluating a quadratic form on an eigenvector has a particularly simple form.

We then have\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})=\\lambda\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{ x}=\\lambda\\left|\\mathbf{x}\\right|^{2}.\\]\nLet's now return to our motivating question: in which direction \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the variance \\(V_{\\mathbf{u}}=\\mathbf{u}\\cdot(C\\mathbf{u})\\) of a dataset as large as possible and in which is it as small as possible. Remembering that the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is a unit vector, we can now state a more general form of this question: _If \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is a quadratic form, for which unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{u})=\\mathbf{u}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{u})\\) as large as possible and for which is it as small as possible?_ Since a unit vector specifies a direction, we will often ask for the directions in which the quadratic form \\(q(\\mathbf{x})\\) is at its maximum or minimum value.\n\n\n",

Several other examples are listed in appendix B.\n## 15 Multi-objective least squares\n### 15.1 A scalar multi-objective least squares problem\nWe consider the special case of the multi-objective least squares problem in which the variable \\(x\\) is a scalar, and the \\(k\\) matrices \\(A_{i}\\) are all \\(1\\times 1\\) matrices with value \\(A_{i}=1\\), so \\(J_{i}=(x-b_{i})^{2}\\). In this case our goal is to choose a number \\(x\\) that is simultaneously close to all the numbers \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{k}\\). Let \\(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k}\\) be positive weights, and \\(\\hat{x}\\) the minimizer of the weighted objective (15.1). Show that \\(\\hat{x}\\) is a weighted average (or convex combination; see page 15.1) of the numbers \\(b_{1},\\ldots,b_{k}\\), _i.e._, it has the form\n\\[x=w_{1}b_{1}+\\cdots+w_{k}b_{k},\\]\nwhere \\(w_{i}\\) are nonnegative and sum to one. Give an explicit formula for the combination weights \\(w_{i}\\) in terms of the multi-objective least squares weights \\(\\lambda_{i}\\).\nConsider the regularized data fitting problem (15.7). Recall that the elements in the first column of \\(A\\) are one. Let \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) be the solution of (15.7), _i.e._, the minimizer of\n\\[\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{2}+\\lambda(\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\theta_{p}^{2}),\\]\nand let \\(\\tilde{\\theta}\\) be the minimizer of\n\\[\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{2}+\\lambda\\|\\theta\\|^{2}=\\left\\|A\\theta-y\\right\\|^{ 2}+\\lambda(\\theta_{1}^{2}+\\theta_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\theta_{p}^{2}),\\]\nin which we also penalize \\(\\theta_{1}\\). Suppose columns 2 through \\(p\\) of \\(A\\) have mean zero (for example, because features \\(2,\\ldots,p\\) have been standardized on the data set; see page 15.2). Show that \\(\\tilde{\\theta}_{k}=\\tilde{\\theta}_{k}\\) for \\(k=2,\\ldots,p\\).\n_Weighted Gram matrix_. Consider a multi-objective least squares problems with matrices \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{k}\\) and positive weights \\(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k}\\). The matrix\n\\[G=\\lambda_{1}A_{1}^{T}A_{1}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}A_{k}^{T}A_{k}\\]\nis called the _weighted Gram matrix_; it is the Gram matrix of the stacked matrix \\(\\tilde{A}\\) (given in (15.2)) associated with the multi-objective problem. Show that \\(G\\) is invertible provided there is no nonzero vector \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(A_{1}x=0,\\,\\ldots,\\,A_{k}x=0\\).\n_Robust approximate solution of linear equations._ We wish to solve the square set of \\(n\\) linear equations \\(Ax=b\\) for the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\). If \\(A\\) is invertible the solution is \\(x=A^{-1}b\\). In this exercise we address an issue that comes up frequently: We don't know \\(A\\) exactly. One simple method is to just choose a typical value of \\(A\\) and use it. Another method, which we explore here, takes into account the variation in the matrix \\(A\\). We find a set of \\(K\\) versions of \\(A\\), and denote them as \\(A^{(1)},\\ldots,A^{(K)}\\). (These could be found by measuring the matrix \\(A\\) at different times, for example.) Then we choose \\(x\\) so as to minimize\n\n\n",

Recall how we used the fact that a symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable: if \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\), then \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{u})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{v})\\) where \\(\\mathbf{v}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{u}\\).\nMore generally, if we define \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), we have\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}\\cdot(QDQ^{T}\\mathbf{ x})=(Q^{T}\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(DQ^{T}\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{y}\\cdot(D\\mathbf{y})=q_{D}( \\mathbf{y})\\]\nRemembering that the quadratic form associated to a diagonal form has no cross terms, we obtain\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{y})=\\lambda_{1}y_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}y_{2}^{2}+ \\ldots+\\lambda_{m}y_{m}^{2}.\\]\nIn other words, after a change of coordinates, the quadratic form \\(q_{A}\\) can be written without cross terms. This is known as the Principle Axes Theorem.\n**Theorem 7.2.10**: **Principle Axes Theorem.** _If \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(m\\times m\\) matrix with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1}\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\lambda_{m}\\), then the quadratic form \\(q_{A}\\) can be written, after an orthogonal change of coordinates \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), as_\n\\[q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\lambda_{1}y_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}y_{2}^{2}+\\ldots+\\lambda_{m }y_{m}^{2}.\\]\nWe will put this to use in the next section.\n#### Definite symmetric matrices\nWhile our questions about variance provide some motivation for exploring quadratic forms, these functions appear in a variety of other contexts so it's worth spending some more time with them. For example, quadratic forms appear in multivariable calculus when describing the behavior of a function of several variables near a critical point and in physics when describing the kinetic energy of a rigid body.\nFigure 7.2.9: The demeaned data from Preview Activity 7.2.1 is shown projected onto the lines of maximal and minimal variance.\nThe following definition will be important in this section.\n**Definition 7.2.11** A symmetric matrix \\(A\\) is called _positive definite_ if its associated quadratic form satisfies \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for any nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). If \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\geq 0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we say that \\(A\\) is _positive semidefinite_.\nLikewise, we say that \\(A\\) is _negative definite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for all nonzero vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nFinally, \\(A\\) is called _indefinite_ if \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})>0\\) for some \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})<0\\) for others.\n**Activity 7.2.4.** This activity explores the relationship between the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix and its definiteness.\n1. Consider the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{bmatrix}\\) and write its quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in terms of the components of \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\). How does this help you decide whether \\(D\\) is positive definite or not?\n2. Now consider \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{bmatrix}\\) and write its quadratic form \\(q_{D}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in terms of \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\). What can you say about the definiteness of \\(D\\)?\n3. If \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix, what condition on the diagonal entries guarantee that \\(D\\) is 1. positive definite? 2. positive semidefinite? 3. negative definite? 4. negative semidefinite? 5. indefinite?\n4. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 4 and 2 so that \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\) where \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}4&0\\\\ 0&2\\end{bmatrix}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{y}=Q^{T}\\mathbf{x}\\), then we have \\(q_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=q_{D}(\\mathbf{y})\\). Explain why this tells us that \\(A\\) is positive definite.\n5. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues 4 and 0. What can you say about the definiteness of \\(A\\) in this case?\n6.

Functions of this kind are called _splines_.\nAdvertising budget allocation.We continue the example described on page 234, where the goal is to purchase advertising in \\(n\\) different channels so as to achieve (or approximately achieve) a target set of customer views or impressions in \\(m\\) different demographic groups. We denote the \\(n\\)-vector of channel spending as \\(s\\); this spending results in a set of views (across the demographic groups) given by the \\(m\\)-vector \\(Rs\\). We will minimize the sum of squares of the deviation from the target set of views, given by \\(v^{\\rm des}\\). In addition, we fix our total advertising spending, with the constraint \\({\\bf 1}^{T}s=B\\), where \\(B\\) is a given total advertising budget. (This can also be described as _allocating_ a total budget \\(B\\) across the \\(n\\) different channels.) This leads to the constrained least squares problem\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{minimize}&\\|Rs-v^{\\rm des}\\|^{2}\\\\ \\mbox{subject to}&{\\bf 1}^{T}s=B.\\end{array}\\]\n(The solution \\(\\hat{s}\\) of this problem is not guaranteed to have nonnegative entries, as it must to make sense in this application. But we ignore this aspect of the problem here.)\nWe consider the same problem instance as on page 234, with \\(m=10\\) demographic groups and \\(n=3\\) channels, and reach matrix \\(R\\) given there. The least squares method yields an RMS error of 133 (around 13.3%), with a total budget of \\(\\mathbf{1}^{T}s^{\\mathrm{ls}}=1605\\). We seek a spending plan with a budget that is 20% smaller, \\(B=1284\\). Solving the associated constrained least squares problem yields the spending vector \\(s^{\\mathrm{cls}}=(315,110,859)\\), which has RMS error of 161 in the target views. We can compare this spending vector to the one obtained by simply scaling the least squares spending vector by 0.80. The RMS error for this allocation is 239. The resulting impressions for both spending plans are shown in figure 16.2.\n\n\n",

We record this fact in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 7.1.9**: **The Spectral Theorem.** _The matrix \\(A\\) is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if \\(A\\) is symmetric._\nFigure 7.1.8: The transformation defined by \\(A=QDQ^{T}\\) can be interpreted as a sequence of geometric transformations: \\(Q^{T}\\) rotates by \\(-45^{\\circ}\\), \\(D\\) stretches and reflects, and \\(Q\\) rotates by \\(45^{\\circ}\\).\n**Activity 7.1.3**.: Each of the following matrices is symmetric so the Spectral Theorem tells us that each is orthogonally diagonalizable. The point of this activity is to find an orthogonal diagonalization for each matrix.\nTo begin, find a basis for each eigenspace. Use this basis to find an orthogonal basis for each eigenspace and put these bases together to find an orthogonal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) consisting of eigenvectors. Use this basis to write an orthogonal diagonalization of the matrix.\n1. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}0&2\\\\ 2&3\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n2. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}4&-2&14\\\\ -2&19&-16\\\\ 14&-16&13\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n3. \\(\\begin{bmatrix}5&4&2\\\\ 4&5&2\\\\ 2&2&2\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n4. Consider the matrix \\(A=B^{T}B\\) where \\(B=\\begin{bmatrix}0&1&2\\\\ 2&0&1\\end{bmatrix}\\). Explain how we know that \\(A\\) is symmetric and then find an orthogonal diagonalization of \\(A\\).\nAs the examples in Activity 7.1.3 illustrate, the Spectral Theorem implies a number of things. Namely, if \\(A\\) is a symmetric \\(m\\times m\\) matrix, then\n* the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are real.\n* there is a basis of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) consisting of eigenvectors.\n* two eigenvectors that are associated to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\nWe won't justify the first two facts here since that would take us rather far afield. However, it will be helpful to explain the third fact. To begin, notice the following:\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=\\mathbf{v}^{T}A\\mathbf{w}=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})^{T} \\mathbf{w}=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\nThis is a useful fact that we'll employ quite a bit in the future so let's summarize it in the following proposition.\n**Proposition 7.1.10**_For any matrix \\(A\\), we have_\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=(A^{T}\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\n_In particular, if \\(A\\) is symmetric, then_\n\\[\\mathbf{v}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{w})=(A\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}.\\]\n**Example 7.1.11** Suppose a symmetric matrix \\(A\\) has eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{1}=3\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), with associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_{2}=10\\). Notice that\n\\[(A\\mathbf{v}_{1})\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2} =3\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\] \\[\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}) =10\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}.\\]\nSince \\((A\\mathbf{v}_{1})\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot(A\\mathbf{v}_{2})\\) by Proposition 7.1.10, we have\n\\[3\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}=10\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\]\nwhich can only happen if \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{2}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are orthogonal.\nMore generally, the same argument shows that two eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix associated to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n#### Variance\nMany of the ideas we'll encounter in this chapter, such as orthogonal diagonalizations, can be applied to the study of data. In fact, it can be useful to understand these applications because they provide an important context in which mathematical ideas have a more concrete meaning and their motivation appears more clearly. For that reason, we will now introduce the statistical concept of variance as a way to gain insight into the significance of orthogonal diagonalizations.\n\n\n",

Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2.

What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\nwhose solutions are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). This equation is called the _characteristic equation_ of \\(A\\).\n**Example 4.2.1** If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4&4\\\\ -12&10\\end{array}\\right]\\), we see\nthat\n\\[\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\]\n\\[\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}-4-\\lambda&4\\\\ -12&10-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right]=0\\]\n\\[(-4-\\lambda)(10-\\lambda)+48=0\\]\n\\[\\lambda^{2}-6\\lambda+8=0\\]\n\n\n",

Convolution arises in many applications and contexts.\nAs a specific numerical example, we have \\((1,0,-1)*(2,1,-1)=(2,1,-3,-1,1)\\), where the entries of the convolution result are found from\n\\[2 = (1)(2)\\] \\[1 = (1)(1)+(0)(2)\\] \\[-3 = (1)(-1)+(0)(1)+(-1)(2)\\] \\[-1 = (0)(-1)+(-1)(1)\\] \\[1 = (-1)(-1).\\]\nPolynomial multiplication.If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent the coefficients of two polynomials\n\\[p(x)=a_{1}+a_{2}x+\\cdots+a_{n}x^{n-1},\\qquad q(x)=b_{1}+b_{2}x+\\cdots+b_{m}x^{ m-1},\\]\nthen the coefficients of the product polynomial \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are represented by \\(c=a*b\\):\n\\[p(x)q(x)=c_{1}+c_{2}x+\\cdots+c_{n+m-1}x^{n+m-2}.\\]\nTo see this we will show that \\(c_{k}\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{k-1}\\) in \\(p(x)q(x)\\). We expand the product polynomial into \\(mn\\) terms, and collect those terms associated with \\(x^{k-1}\\). These terms have the form \\(a_{i}b_{j}x^{i+j-2}\\), for \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) that satisfy \\(i+j-2=k-1\\), _i.e._, \\(i+j=k-1\\). It follows that \\(c_{k}=\\sum_{i+j=k+1}a_{i}b_{j}\\), which agrees with the convolution formula (7.2).\nProperties of convolution.Convolution is symmetric: We have \\(a*b=b*a\\). It is also associative: We have \\((a*b)*c=a*(b*c)\\), so we can write both as \\(a*b*c\\). Another property is that \\(a*b=0\\) implies that either \\(a=0\\) or \\(b=0\\). These properties follow from the polynomial coefficient property above, and can also be directly shown. As an example, let us show that \\(a*b=b*a\\). Suppose \\(p\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(a\\), and \\(q\\) is the polynomial with coefficients \\(b\\). The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients. The coefficients of \\(p(x)q(x)\\) are \\(a*b\\) and the coefficients of \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are \\(b*a\\). These must be the same.\nA basic property is that for fixed \\(a\\), the convolution \\(a*b\\) is a linear function of \\(b\\); and for fixed \\(b\\), it is a linear function of \\(a\\). This means we can express \\(a*b\\) as a matrix-vector product:\n\\[a*b=T(b)a=T(a)b,\\]\nwhere \\(T(b)\\) is the \\((n+m-1)\\times n\\) matrix with entries \\[T(b)_{ij}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}b_{i-j+1}&1\\leq i-j+1\\leq m\\\\ 0&\\text{otherwise}\\end{array}\\right.\\] (7.3) and similarly for \\(T(a)\\). For example, with \\(n=4\\) and \\(m=3\\), we have \\[T(b)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}b_{1}&0&0&0\\\\ b_{2}&b_{1}&0&0\\\\ b_{3}&b_{2}&b_{1}&0\\\\ 0&b_{3}&b_{2}&b_{1}\\\\ 0&0&b_{3}&b_{2}\\\\ 0&0&0&b_{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad T(a)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}a_{1}&0&0 \\\\ a_{2}&a_{1}&0\\\\ a_{3}&a_{2}&a_{1}\\\\ a_{4}&a_{3}&a_{2}\\\\ 0&a_{4}&a_{3}\\\\ 0&0&a_{4}\\end{array}\\right].\\] The matrices \\(T(b)\\) and \\(T(a)\\) are called _Toeplitz_ matrices (named after the mathematician Otto Toeplitz), which means the entries on any diagonal (_i.e._, indices with \\(i-j\\) constant) are the same. The columns of the Toeplitz matrix \\(T(a)\\) are simply shifted versions of the vector \\(a\\), padded with zero entries.\nVariations.Several slightly different definitions of convolution are used in different applications. In one variation, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are infinite two-sided sequences (and not vectors) with indices ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\). In another variation, the rows of \\(T(a)\\) at the top and bottom that do not contain all the coefficients of \\(a\\) are dropped. (In this version, the rows of \\(T(a)\\) are shifted versions of the vector \\(a\\), reversed.) For consistency, we will use the one definition (7.2).\nExamples.\n* _Time series smoothing._ Suppose the \\(n\\)-vector \\(x\\) is a time series, and \\(a=(1/3,1/3,1/3)\\). Then the \\((n+2)\\)-vector \\(y=a*x\\) can be interpreted as a _smoothed_ version of the original time series: for \\(i=3,\\ldots,n\\), \\(y_{i}\\) is the average of \\(x_{i}\\), \\(x_{i-1}\\), \\(x_{i-2}\\). The time series \\(y\\) is called the (3-period) _moving average_ of the time series \\(x\\). Figure 7.6 shows an example.\n\n\n",

We are particularly interested in representing a subspace as the span of a linearly independent set of vectors.\n**Definition 3.5.4** A _basis_ for a subspace \\(S\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) is a set of vectors in \\(S\\) that are linearly independent and whose span is \\(S\\). We say that the _dimension_ of the subspace \\(S\\), denoted \\(\\dim S\\)\nFigure 3.5.3: Two lines in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), one of which is a subspace and one of which is not.\nis the number of vectors in any basis.\n**Example 3.5.5**: **A subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).** Suppose we have the 4-dimensional vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) that define the subspace \\(S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\).

Therefore, any linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) can be rewritten\n\\[c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}=(c_{1}-c_{2}) \\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\]\nas a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\). This tells us that\n\\[S=\\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}= \\operatorname{Span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}.\\]\nFurthermore, the reduced row echelon form of the matrix shows that \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\) are linearly independent.

(In this case the algorithm is said to _diverge_.) The mechanism behind this failure is related to the difference between (18.7) and (18.8). The approximation\n\\[\\|f(x)\\|^{2}\\approx\\|\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\]\nis guaranteed to hold only when \\(x\\) is near \\(x^{(k)}\\). So when \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is not near \\(x^{(k)}\\), \\(\\|f(x^{(k+1)})\\|^{2}\\) and \\(\\|\\hat{f}(x^{(k+1)};x^{(k)})\\|^{2}\\) can be very different. In particular, the (true) residual at \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) can be _larger_ than the residual at \\(x^{(k)}\\).\nThe second serious shortcoming of the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm is the assumption that the columns of the derivative matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) are linearly independent. In some applications, this assumption never holds; in others, it can fail to hold at some iterate \\(x^{(k)}\\), in which case the Gauss-Newton algorithm stops, since \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) is not defined.\nWe will see that a simple modification of the Gauss-Newton algorithm, described below in SS18.3, addresses both of these shortcomings.\n#### Newton algorithm\nFor the special case \\(m=n\\), the Gauss-Newton algorithm reduces to another famous algorithm for solving a set of \\(n\\) nonlinear equations in \\(n\\) variables, called the Newton algorithm. (The algorithm is sometimes called the Newton-Raphson algorithm, since Newton developed the method only for the special case \\(n=1\\), and Joseph Raphson later extended it to the case \\(n>1\\).)\nWhen \\(m=n\\), the matrix \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) is square, so the basic Gauss-Newton update (18.6) can be simplified to\n\\[x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)}-(Df(x^{(k)}))^{-1}(Df(x^{(k)})^{T})^{-1}Df(x^{(k)})^{T} f(x^{(k)})\\] \\[= x^{(k)}-(Df(x^{(k)}))^{-1}f(x^{(k)}).\\]\nThis iteration gives the Newton algorithm.\n**Algorithm 18.2** Newton algorithm for solving nonlinear equations\n**given** a differentiable function \\(f:\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\to\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\), an initial point \\(x^{(1)}\\).\nFor \\(k=1,2,\\ldots,k^{\\max}\\)\n1. _Form affine approximation at current iterate_. Evaluate the Jacobian \\(Df(x^{(k)})\\) and define \\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+Df(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)}).\\]\n2. _Update iterate by solving linear equations_. Set \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) as the solution of \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=0\\), \\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-\\left(Df(x^{(k)})\\right)^{-1}f(x^{(k)}).\\]\n**Algorithm 18.2** Newton algorithm for solving nonlinear equations\nThe basic Newton algorithm shares the same shortcomings as the basic Gauss-Newton algorithm, _i.e._, it can diverge, and the iterations terminate if the derivative matrix is not invertible.\nNewton algorithm for \\(n=1\\).The Newton algorithm is easily understood for \\(n=1\\). The iteration is\n\\[x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}-f(x^{(k)})/f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})\\] (18.9)\nand is illustrated in figure 18.2. To update \\(x^{(k)}\\) we form the Taylor approximation\n\\[\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=f(x^{(k)})+f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})(x-x^{(k)})\\]\nand set it to zero to find the next iterate \\(x^{(k+1)}\\). If \\(f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})\\neq 0\\), the solution of \\(\\hat{f}(x;x^{(k)})=0\\) is given by the right-hand side of (18.9). If \\(f^{\\prime}(x^{(k)})=0\\), the Newton algorithm terminates with an error.\nFigure 18.2: One iteration of the Newton algorithm for solving an equation \\(f(x)=0\\) in one variable.\n**Example.** The function\n\\[f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}\\] (18.10)\nhas a unique zero at the origin, _i.e._, the only solution of \\(f(x)=0\\) is \\(x=0\\). (This function is called the _sigmoid function_, and will make another appearance later.) The Newton iteration started at \\(x^{(1)}=0.95\\) converges quickly to the solution \\(x=0\\).

More specifically, any matrix \\(A\\) defines a function\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|A\\mathbf{x}|,\\]\nwhich measures the length of \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\). For example, the diagonal matrix \\(D=\\begin{bmatrix}3&0\\\\ 0&-2\\end{bmatrix}\\) gives the function \\(l_{D}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{9x_{1}^{2}+4x_{2}^{2}}\\). The presence of the square root means that this function is not a quadratic form. We can, however, define the singular values and vectors by looking for the maximum and minimum of this function \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{u})\\) among all unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\).\nWhile \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is not itself a quadratic form, it becomes one if we square it:\n\\[(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x}))^{2}=|A\\mathbf{x}|^{2}=(A\\mathbf{x})\\cdot(A\\mathbf{x})= \\mathbf{x}\\cdot(A^{T}A\\mathbf{x})=q_{A^{T}A}(\\mathbf{x}).\\]\nWe call \\(G=A^{T}A\\), the _Gram matrix_ associated to \\(A\\) and note that\n\\[l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}.\\]\nThis is important in the next activity, which introduces singular values and singular vectors.\n**Activity 7.4.2**.: The following interactive figure will help us explore singular values and vectors geometrically before we begin a more algebraic approach.\nThere is an interactive diagram, available at gvsu.edu/s/0VE, that accompanies this activity.\n**Figure 7.4.1** Singular values, right singular vectors and left singular vectors\nSelect the matrix \\(A=\\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\\\ -2&-1\\end{bmatrix}\\). As we vary the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), we see the vector \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) on the right in gray while the height of the blue bar to the right tells us \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=|A\\mathbf{x}|\\).\n* The first _singular value_\\(\\sigma_{1}\\) is the maximum value of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and an associated _right singular vector_\\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) is a unit vector describing a direction in which this maximum occurs. Use the diagram to find the first singular value \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\).\n* The second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) is the minimum value of \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) is a unit vector describing a direction in which this minimum occurs. Use the diagram to find the second singular value \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) and an associated right singular vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\).\n* Here's how we can find the right singular values and vectors without using the diagram. Remember that \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\) where \\(G=A^{T}A\\) is the Gram matrix associated to \\(A\\). Since \\(G\\) is symmetric, it is orthogonally diagonalizable. Find \\(G\\) and an orthogonal diagonalization of it.\nWhat is the maximum value of the quadratic form \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) among all unit vectors and in which direction does it occur? What is the minimum value of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and in which direction does it occur?\n* Because \\(l_{A}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sqrt{q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})}\\), the first singular value \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) will be the square root of the maximum value of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) the square root of the minimum. Verify that the singular values that you found from the diagram are the square roots of the maximum and minimum values of \\(q_{G}(\\mathbf{x})\\).\n* Verify that the right singular vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) that you found from the diagram are the directions in which the maximum and minimum values occur.\n* Finally, we introduce the _left singular vectors_\\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) by requiring that \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{1}=\\sigma_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(A\\mathbf{v}_{2}=\\sigma_{2}\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\).

For example, we see that the coefficient \\(c_{4}\\) is not very sensitive to the value of \\(b_{1}\\) (since \\((A^{-1})_{41}\\) is small). We can also see that for each increase of one in \\(b_{4}\\), the coefficient \\(c_{2}\\) increases by around 0.95.\nBalancing chemical reactions.(See page 154 for background.)

We will now develop a more algebraic understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we will find an algebraic method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.\n**Preview Activity 4.2.1.** Let's begin by reviewing some important ideas that we have seen previously.\n1. Suppose that \\(A\\) is a square matrix and that the nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\). What can we conclude about the invertibility of \\(A\\)?\n2. How does the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\) tell us if there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n3. Suppose that \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3&-1&1\\\\ 0&2&4\\\\ 1&1&3\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A)\\). What does this tell us about the solution space to the homogeneous equation \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}\\)?\n4. Find a basis for \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\).\n5. What is the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimension of its null space?\n#### The characteristic polynomial\nWe will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix appear as the roots of a particular polynomial. To begin, notice that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfies the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\). We will rewrite this as\n\\[A\\mathbf{v} =\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda I\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}\\] \\[(A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{0}.\\]\nIn other words, an eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a solution of the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\). This puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next activity.\n**Activity 4.2.2**.: The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\).\n1. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the invertibility of the matrix \\(A-\\lambda I\\)?\n2. If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\), what can we conclude about the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\)?\n3. Let's consider the matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]\\] from which we construct \\[A-\\lambda I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&2\\\\ 2&1\\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1-\\lambda&2\\\\ 2&1-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right].\\] Find the determinant \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)\\). What kind of equation do you obtain when we set this determinant to zero to obtain \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\)?\n4. Use the determinant you found in the previous part to find the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\). We considered this matrix in Activity 4.1.2 so we should find the same eigenvalues for \\(A\\) that we found by reasoning geometrically there.\n5. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&1\\\\ 0&2\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n6. Consider the matrix \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\\\ 1&0\\end{array}\\right]\\) and find its eigenvalues by solving the equation \\(\\det(A-\\lambda I)=0\\).\n7. Find the eigenvalues of the triangular matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3&-1&4\\\\ 0&-2&3\\\\ 0&0&1\\end{array}\\right]\\). What is generally true about the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix?\nThis activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find the eigenvalues of a square matrix \\(A\\). Since an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar for which the equation \\((A-\\lambda I)\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}\\) has a nonzero solution, it must be the case that \\(A-\\lambda I\\) is not invertible. Therefore, its determinant is zero. This gives us the equation\n\n\n",

But the Euclidean distance is defined for vectors of any dimension; we can refer to the distance between two vectors of dimension 100. Since we only use the Euclidean norm in this book, we will refer to the Euclidean distance between vectors as, simply, the distance between the vectors. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(n\\)-vectors, we refer to the RMS value of the difference, \\(\\|a-b\\|/\\sqrt{n}\\), as the _RMS deviation_ between the two vectors.\nWhen the distance between two \\(n\\)-vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is small, we say they are 'close' or 'nearby', and when the distance \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) is large, we say they are 'far'. The particular numerical values of \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) that correspond to 'close' or 'far' depend on\nFigure 3.1: The norm of the displacement \\(b-a\\) is the distance between the points with coordinates \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nAs an example, consider the 4-vectors\n\\[u=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1.8\\\\ 2.0\\\\ -3.7\\\\ 4.7\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad v=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}0.6\\\\ 2.1\\\\ 1.9\\\\ -1.4\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad w=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}2.0\\\\ 1.9\\\\ -4.0\\\\ 4.6\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nThe distances between pairs of them are\n\\[\\|u-v\\|=8.368,\\qquad\\|u-w\\|=0.387,\\qquad\\|v-w\\|=8.533,\\]\nso we can say that \\(u\\) is much nearer (or closer) to \\(w\\) than it is to \\(v\\). We can also say that \\(w\\) is much nearer to \\(u\\) than it is to \\(v\\).\nTriangle inequality.We can now explain where the triangle inequality gets its name. Consider a triangle in two or three dimensions, whose vertices have coordinates \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The lengths of the sides are the distances between the vertices,\n\\[\\mathbf{dist}(a,b)=\\|a-b\\|,\\qquad\\mathbf{dist}(b,c)=\\|b-c\\|,\\qquad\\mathbf{dist }(a,c)=\\|a-c\\|.\\]\nGeometric intuition tells us that the length of any side of a triangle cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. For example, we have\n\\[\\|a-c\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\] (3.3)\nThis follows from the triangle inequality, since\n\\[\\|a-c\\|=\\|(a-b)+(b-c)\\|\\leq\\|a-b\\|+\\|b-c\\|.\\]\nThis is illustrated in figure 3.2.\nFigure 3.2: Triangle inequality.\n#### Examples.\n* _Feature distance._ If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent vectors of \\(n\\) features of two objects, the quantity \\(\\|x-y\\|\\) is called the _feature distance_, and gives a measure of how different the objects are (in terms of their feature values). Suppose for example the feature vectors are associated with patients in a hospital, with entries such as weight, age, presence of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and the results of tests. We can use feature vector distance to say that one patient case is near another one (at least in terms of their feature vectors).\n* _RMS prediction error._ Suppose that the \\(n\\)-vector \\(y\\) represents a time series of some quantity, for example, hourly temperature at some location, and \\(\\hat{y}\\) is another \\(n\\)-vector that represents an estimate or prediction of the time series \\(y\\), based on other information. The difference \\(y-\\hat{y}\\) is called the _prediction error_, and its RMS value \\(\\mathbf{rms}(y-\\hat{y})\\) is called the _RMS prediction error_. If this value is small (say, compared to \\(\\mathbf{rms}(y)\\)) the prediction is good.\n* _Nearest neighbor._ Suppose \\(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{m}\\) is a collection of \\(m\\)\\(n\\)-vectors, and that \\(x\\) is another \\(n\\)-vector. We say that \\(z_{j}\\) is the _nearest neighbor_ of \\(x\\) (among \\(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{m}\\)) if \\[\\|x-z_{j}\\|\\leq\\|x-z_{i}\\|,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,m.\\] In words: \\(z_{j}\\) is the closest vector to \\(x\\) among the vectors \\(z_{1},\\ldots,z_{m}\\). This is illustrated in figure 3.3. The idea of nearest neighbor, and generalizations such as the \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors, are used in many applications.\n\n\n",

If \\(Q\\) is the matrix whose columns are \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\), find the product \\(Q^{T}Q\\) and explain your result.\nThis activity demonstrates one issue of note. We found \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\), by requiring that \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) be orthogonal to \\(W\\). In other words, \\(\\mathbf{b}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is a vector in the orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\), which we may denote \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\). This explains the following proposition, which is illustrated in Figure 6.3.19\n**Proposition 6.3.18**: _If \\(W\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) with orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\), then any \\(n\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) can be uniquely written as_\n\\[\\mathbf{b}=\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}+\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\]\n_where \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is in \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is in \\(W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(W^{\\perp}\\)._\nLet's summarize what we've found. If \\(Q\\) is a matrix whose columns \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\) form an orthonormal set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then\n* \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{n}\\), the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix, because this product computes the dot products between the columns of \\(Q\\).\n* \\(QQ^{T}\\) is the matrix the projects vectors orthogonally onto \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) spanned by \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{n}\\).\nAs we've said before, matrix multiplication depends on the order in which we multiply the matrices, and we see this clearly here.\nBecause \\(Q^{T}Q=I\\), there is a temptation to say that \\(Q\\) is invertible. This is usually not the case, however. Remember that an invertible matrix must be a square matrix, and the matrix \\(Q\\) will only be square if \\(n=m\\). In this case, there are \\(m\\) vectors in the orthonormal set so the subspace \\(W\\) spanned by the vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_{m}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\), then \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}=QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the orthogonal projection of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\). In other words, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}\\) is the closest vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and this closest vector must be \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself. Therefore, \\(QQ^{T}\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\), which means that \\(QQ^{T}=I\\). In this case, \\(Q\\) is an invertible matrix.\nFigure 6.3.19: A vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) along with \\(\\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the line \\(L\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\perp}\\), its orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement \\(L^{\\perp}\\).\n**Example 6.3.20** Consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\\[Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}&1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}&0\\end{array}\\right].\\]\nIn this case, \\(\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\) span a plane, a 2-dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\). We know that \\(Q^{T}Q=I_{2}\\) and \\(QQ^{T}\\) projects vectors orthogonally onto the plane. However, \\(Q\\) is not a square matrix so it cannot be invertible.\n**Example 6.3.21** Now consider the orthonormal set of vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{3}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{3}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/ \\sqrt{2}\\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\mathbf{u}_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -1/\\sqrt{6}\\\\ -2/\\sqrt{6}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nand the matrix they define\n\n\n",
