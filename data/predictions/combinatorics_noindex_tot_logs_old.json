In the worst-case scenario, the points are arranged in a grid pattern with 4 points on each side of the square and 3 points in the middle row. This arrangement ensures that the circle covers only 7 points, as each point is at a distance of $\\frac{\\sqrt 2}{3}$ from its nearest neighbor.\n\n6. Since we have shown that at least 7 points must be covered by the circle, we can conclude that the minimum number of points that can be guaranteed to be covered is 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.\n"]}]}
