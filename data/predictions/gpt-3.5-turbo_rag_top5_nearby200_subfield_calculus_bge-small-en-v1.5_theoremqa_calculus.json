We would like to compute\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y\\;dx,\\]\nbut we do not know \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\).

Something similar is true for line integrals of a certain form.\n**Theorem 16.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals**  Suppose a curve \\(C\\) is given by the vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), with \\({\\bf a}={\\bf r}(a)\\) and \\({\\bf b}={\\bf r}(b)\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=f({\\bf b})-f({\\bf a}),\\]\nprovided that \\({\\bf r}\\) is sufficiently nice.\nProof.: We write \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\\rangle\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle x^{\\prime}(t),y^{\\prime}(t),z^{\\prime}(t)\\rangle\\). Also, we know that \\(\\nabla f=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle \\cdot\\langle x^{\\prime}(t),y^{\\prime}(t),z^{\\prime}(t)\\rangle\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b }f_{x}x^{\\prime}+f_{y}y^{\\prime}+f_{z}z^{\\prime}\\,dt.\\]\nBy the chain rule (see section 14.4) \\(f_{x}x^{\\prime}+f_{y}y^{\\prime}+f_{z}z^{\\prime}=df/dt\\), where \\(f\\) in this context means \\(f(x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), a function of \\(t\\). In other words, all we have is\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}f^{\\prime}(t)\\,dt=f(b)-f(a).\\]\nIn this context, \\(f(a)=f(x(a),y(a),z(a))\\). Since \\({\\bf a}={\\bf r}(a)=\\langle x(a),y(a),z(a)\\rangle\\), we can write \\(f(a)=f({\\bf a})\\)--this is a bit of a cheat, since we are simultaneously using \\(f\\) to mean \\(f(t)\\) and \\(f(x,y,z)\\), and since \\(f(x(a),y(a),z(a))\\) is not technically the same as \\(f(\\langle x(a),y(a),z(a)\\rangle)\\), but the concepts are clear and the different uses are compatible.

The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\nWe have shown that the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1 are one-to-one. This means they are invertible, so it is natural to wonder what \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) would be. For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\). We can track step-by-step what is done to \\(x\\) and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter. The function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x}{1-x}\\) is a bit trickier since \\(x\\) occurs in two places. When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem. Theorem 5.2 tells us equation \\(y=f^{-1}(x)\\) is equivalent to \\(f(y)=x\\) and this is the basis of our algorithm.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n27. Analytically show that the function \\(f(x)=x^{3}+3x+1\\) is one-to-one. Since finding a formula for its inverse is beyond the scope of this textbook, use Theorem 5.2 to help you compute \\(f^{-1}(1),\\ f^{-1}(5),\\ \\text{and}\\ f^{-1}(-3)\\).\n28. Let \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^{2}-1}\\). Using the techniques in Section 4.2, graph \\(y=f(x)\\). Verify that \\(f\\) is one-to-one on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Use the procedure outlined on Page 384 and your graphing calculator to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\). Note that since \\(f(0)=0\\), it should be the case that \\(f^{-1}(0)=0\\). What goes wrong when you attempt to substitute \\(x=0\\) into \\(f^{-1}(x)\\)? Discuss with your classmates how this problem arose and possible remedies.\n29. With the help of your classmates, explain why a function which is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on its entire domain would have to be one-to-one, hence invertible.\n30. If \\(f\\) is odd and invertible, prove that \\(f^{-1}\\) is also odd.\n31. Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be invertible functions. With the help of your classmates show that \\((f\\circ g)\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible, and that \\((f\\circ g)^{-1}(x)=(g^{-1}\\circ f^{-1})(x)\\).\n32. What graphical feature must a function \\(f\\) possess for it to be its own inverse?\n33. What conditions must you place on the values of \\(a,b,c\\) and \\(d\\) in Exercise 24 in order to guarantee that the function is invertible?\n#### Answers\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThe notation \\(f^{-1}\\) is an unfortunate choice since you've been programmed since Elementary Algebra to think of this as \\(\\frac{1}{f}\\). This is most definitely _not_ the case since, for instance, \\(f(x)=3x+4\\) has as its inverse \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x-4}{3}\\), which is certainly different than \\(\\frac{1}{f(x)}=\\frac{1}{3x+4}\\). Why does this confusing notation persist? As we mentioned in Section 5.1, the identity function \\(I\\) is to function composition what the real number \\(1\\) is to real number multiplication. The choice of notation \\(f^{-1}\\) alludes to the property that \\(f^{-1}\\circ f=I_{1}\\) and \\(f\\circ f^{-1}=I_{2}\\), in much the same way as \\(3^{-1}\\cdot 3=1\\) and \\(3\\cdot 3^{-1}=1\\).\nLet's turn our attention to the function \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). Is \\(f\\) invertible? A likely candidate for the inverse is the function \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Checking the composition yields \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}}=|x|\\), which is not equal to \\(x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). For example, when \\(x=-2\\), \\(f(-2)=(-2)^{2}=4\\), but \\(g(4)=\\sqrt{4}=2\\), which means \\(g\\) failed to return the input \\(-2\\) from its output \\(4\\). What \\(g\\) did, however, is match the output \\(4\\) to a _different_ input, namely \\(2\\), which satisfies \\(f(2)=4\\). This issue is presented schematically in the picture below.\nWe see from the diagram that since both \\(f(-2)\\) and \\(f(2)\\) are \\(4\\), it is impossible to construct a _function_ which takes \\(4\\) back to _both_\\(x=2\\) and \\(x=-2\\). (By definition, a function matches a real number with exactly one other real number.) From a graphical standpoint, we know that if\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNext, we check \\(g\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the range of \\(g\\). From the graph of \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1, we have that the range of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,-2)\\cup(-2,\\infty)\\). This matches the domain we get from the formula \\(g^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x}{x+2}\\), as it should.\n\\[\\left(g\\circ g^{-1}\\right)(x) = g\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)\\] \\[= g\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)}{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)}{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)} \\cdot\\frac{(x+2)}{(x+2)}\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{clear denominators}\\] \\[= \\frac{2x}{(x+2)-x}\\] \\[= \\frac{2x}{2}\\] \\[= x\\ \\check{\\ }\\check{}\\]\nGraphing \\(y=g(x)\\) and \\(y=g^{-1}(x)\\) on the same set of axes is busy, but we can see the symmetric relationship if we thicken the curve for \\(y=g^{-1}(x)\\). Note that the vertical asymptote \\(x=1\\) of the graph of \\(g\\) corresponds to the horizontal asymptote \\(y=1\\) of the graph of \\(g^{-1}\\), as it should since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are switched. Similarly, the horizontal asymptote \\(y=-2\\) of the graph of \\(g\\) corresponds to the vertical asymptote \\(x=-2\\) of the graph of \\(g^{-1}\\).\nWe now return to \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\).

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=L\\), then \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_{n}=L\\).\nAnd a final useful fact:\n\n\n",

In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips below the \\(x\\)-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area by rectangles. The height of a typical rectangle will still be \\(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i})\\), even if \\(g(x_{i})\\) is negative. Thus the area is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+1-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x -2\\,dx.\\]\nThis is of course the same integral as before, because the region between the curves is identical to the former region--it has just been moved down by 2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 9.1.3**: Find the area between \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}-6x+5\\) over the interval \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\); the curves are shown in figure 9.1.4.

To solve this nonlinear inequality, we follow the same guidelines set forth in Section 2.4: we get \\(0\\) on one side of the inequality and construct a sign diagram. Our original inequality can be rewritten as \\(2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3\\leq 0\\). We found the zeros of \\(p(x)=2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3\\) in part 1 to be \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=1\\).

To interpret this solution graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2x^{5}+6x^{3}+3\\) and \\(g(x)=3x^{4}+8x^{2}\\).

With very little change we can find some areas between curves; indeed, the area between a curve and the \\(x\\)-axis may be interpreted as the area between the curve and a second \"curve\" with equation \\(y=0\\). In the simplest of cases, the idea is quite easy to understand.\n**Example 9.1.1**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+3\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+5\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\). In figure 9.1.1 we show the two curves together, with the desired area shaded, then \\(f\\) alone with the area under \\(f\\) shaded, and then \\(g\\) alone with the area under \\(g\\) shaded.\nFigure 9.1.1: Area between curves as a difference of areas.\n### Chapter 9 Applications of Integration\nIt is clear from the figure that the area we want is the area under \\(f\\) minus the area under \\(g\\), which is to say\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)\\,dx-\\int_{1}^{2}g(x)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx.\\]\nIt doesn't matter whether we compute the two integrals on the left and then subtract or compute the single integral on the right. In this case, the latter is perhaps a bit easier:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx&=\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+3-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+ 5)\\,dx\\cr&=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x-2\\,dx\\cr&=\\left.{x^{4}\\over 4}-{8x^{3} \\over 3}+7x^{2}-2x\\right|_{1}^{2}\\cr&={16\\over 4}-{64\\over 3}+28-4-({1\\over 4}-{8 \\over 3}+7-2)\\cr&=23-{56\\over 3}-{1\\over 4}={49\\over 12}.\\cr}\\]\n\n\n",

It may surprise and delight the reader that, in theory, all polynomials can be reduced to this kind of factorization. We leave that discussion to Section 3.4, because the zeros may not be real numbers. Our final theorem in the section gives us an upper bound on the number of real zeros.\n**Theorem 3.7**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a polynomial of degree \\(n\\geq 1\\). Then \\(f\\) has at most \\(n\\) real zeros, counting multiplicities.\nTheorem 3.7 is a consequence of the Factor Theorem and polynomial multiplication. Every zero \\(c\\) of \\(f\\) gives us a factor of the form \\((x-c)\\) for \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(f\\) has degree \\(n\\), there can be at most \\(n\\) of these factors. The next section provides us some tools which not only help us determine where the real zeros are to be found, but which real numbers they may be.\nWe close this section with a summary of several concepts previously presented. You should take the time to look back through the text to see where each concept was first introduced and where each connection to the other concepts was made.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n4. \\(f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) 5. \\(h(x)=|x|\\) 6. \\(z(x)=0\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. We note directly that the domain of \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4}{x}\\) is \\(x\\neq 0\\). By definition, a polynomial has all real numbers as its domain. Hence, \\(g\\) can't be a polynomial.\n2. Even though \\(p(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x}\\) simplifies to \\(p(x)=x^{2}+4\\), which certainly looks like the form given in Definition 3.1, the domain of \\(p\\), which, as you may recall, we determine _before_ we simplify, excludes \\(0\\). Alas, \\(p\\) is not a polynomial function for the same reason \\(g\\) isn't.\n3. After what happened with \\(p\\) in the previous part, you may be a little shy about simplifying \\(q(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x^{2}+4}\\) to \\(q(x)=x\\), which certainly fits Definition 3.1. If we look at the domain of \\(q\\) before we simplified, we see that it is, indeed, all real numbers. A function which can be written in the form of Definition 3.1 whose domain is all real numbers is, in fact, a polynomial.\n4. We can rewrite \\(f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) as \\(f(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is not a natural number, \\(f\\) is not a polynomial.\n5. The function \\(h(x)=|x|\\) isn't a polynomial, since it can't be written as a combination of powers of \\(x\\) even though it can be written as a piecewise function involving polynomials. As we shall see in this section, graphs of polynomials possess a quality2 that the graph of \\(h\\) does not. Footnote 2: Some authors say \\(f(x)=0\\) has degree \\(-\\infty\\) for reasons not even we will go into.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 3.4 Complex Zeros and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nIn Section 3.3, we were focused on finding the real zeros of a polynomial function. In this section, we expand our horizons and look for the non-real zeros as well. Consider the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^{2}+1\\). The zeros of \\(p\\) are the solutions to \\(x^{2}+1=0\\), or \\(x^{2}=-1\\). This equation has no real solutions, but you may recall from Intermediate Algebra that we can formally extract the square roots of both sides to get \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{-1}\\). The quantity \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is usually re-labeled \\(i\\), the so-called **imaginary unit**.1 The number \\(i\\), while not a real number, plays along well with real numbers, and acts very much like any other radical expression. For instance, \\(3(2i)=6i\\), \\(7i-3i=4i\\), \\((2-7i)+(3+4i)=5-3i\\), and so forth. The key properties which distinguish \\(i\\) from the real numbers are listed below.\nFootnote 1: Some Technical Mathematics textbooks label it ‘\\(j\\)’.\n**Definition 3.4**.: The imaginary unit \\(i\\) satisfies the two following properties\n1. \\(i^{2}=-1\\)\n2. If \\(c\\) is a real number with \\(c\\geq 0\\) then \\(\\sqrt{-c}=i\\sqrt{c}\\)\nProperty 1 in Definition 3.4 establishes that \\(i\\) does act as a square root2 of \\(-1\\), and property 2 establishes what we mean by the 'principal square root' of a negative real number. In property 2, it is important to remember the restriction on \\(c\\). For example, it is perfectly acceptable to say \\(\\sqrt{-4}=i\\sqrt{4}=i(2)=2i\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{-(-4)}\\neq i\\sqrt{-4}\\), otherwise, we'd get\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\nThe next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, \\(2^{-3}=1/2^{3}\\). We know that whatever \\(2^{-3}\\) means it must be that \\(2^{-3}2^{3}=2^{-3+3}=2^{0}=1\\), which means that \\(2^{-3}\\) must be \\(1/2^{3}\\). In fact, by the same argument, once we know what \\(2^{x}\\) means for some value of \\(x\\), \\(2^{-x}\\) must be \\(1/2^{x}\\) and more generally \\(a^{-x}=1/a^{x}\\).\nNext, consider an exponent \\(1/q\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive integer. We want it to be true that \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\), so \\((2^{1/q})^{q}=2\\). This means that \\(2^{1/q}\\) is a \\(q\\)-th root of 2, \\(2^{1/q}=\\sqrt[q]{2}\\) . This is all we need to understand that \\(2^{p/q}=(2^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{2}\\ )^{p}\\) and \\(a^{p/q}=(a^{1/q})^{p}=(\\sqrt[q]{a}\\ )^{p}\\).\nWhat's left is the hard part: what does \\(2^{x}\\) mean when \\(x\\) cannot be written as a fraction, like \\(x=\\sqrt{2}\\ \\) or \\(x=\\pi\\)? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to \\(2^{x}\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. We note directly that the domain of \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4}{x}\\) is \\(x\\neq 0\\). By definition, a polynomial has all real numbers as its domain. Hence, \\(g\\) can't be a polynomial.\n2. Even though \\(p(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x}\\) simplifies to \\(p(x)=x^{2}+4\\), which certainly looks like the form given in Definition 3.1, the domain of \\(p\\), which, as you may recall, we determine _before_ we simplify, excludes \\(0\\).

A function which can be written in the form of Definition 3.1 whose domain is all real numbers is, in fact, a polynomial.\n4. We can rewrite \\(f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) as \\(f(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is not a natural number, \\(f\\) is not a polynomial.\n5.

Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation.

The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\).

We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2.

To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly.

To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\nTo solve \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\), we need the techniques in Chapter 3 to factor \\(4u^{3}-2u-2\\) into \\((u-1)\\left(4u^{2}+4u+2\\right)\\).

While we could approach \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\) in the same manner as we did the previous two problems, we choose instead to showcase the utility of the Sum to Product Identities. From \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=0\\), and it is the presence of \\(0\\) on the right hand side that indicates a switch to a product would be a good move.7 Using Theorem 10.21, we have that \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=-2\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x+3x}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x-3x}{2} \\right)=-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)\\). Hence, the equation \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is equivalent to \\(-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)=0\\). From this, we get \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=0\\).

The second set of solutions is contained in the first set of solutions,8 so our final solution to \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\).

To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\n\n",

Since \\(f\\) is a fifth degree polynomial, we know that we need to perform at least three successful divisions to get the quotient down to a quadratic function. At that point, we can find the remaining zeros using the Quadratic Formula, if necessary. Using the techniques developed in Section 3.3, we get\n\\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrrrrr}\\frac{1}{2}&12&-20&19&-6&-2&1\\\\ &\\downarrow&6&-7&6&0&-1\\\\ \\hline 12&-14&12&0&-2&0\\\\ \\downarrow&6&-4&4&2\\\\ \\hline 12&-8&8&4&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4&4&-4\\\\ \\hline 12&-12&12&0\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nOur quotient is \\(12x^{2}-12x+12\\), whose zeros we find to be \\(\\frac{1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). From Theorem 3.14, we know \\(f\\) has exactly \\(5\\) zeros, counting multiplicities, and as such we have the zero \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) with multiplicity \\(2\\), and the zeros \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), each of multiplicity \\(1\\).\n2. Applying Theorem 3.14, we are guaranteed that \\(f\\) factors as \\[f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left[ \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\left(x-\\left[\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\]\nA true test of Theorem 3.14 (and a student's mettle!) would be to take the factored form of \\(f(x)\\) in the previous example and multiply it out9 to see that it really does reduce to the original formula \\(f(x)=12x^{5}-20x^{4}+19x^{3}-6x^{2}-2x+1\\). When factoring a polynomial using Theorem 3.14, we say that it is **factored completely over the complex numbers**, meaning that it is impossible to factor the polynomial any further using complex numbers. If we wanted to completely factor \\(f(x)\\) over the **real numbers** then we would have stopped short of finding the nonreal zeros of \\(f\\) and factored \\(f\\) using our work from the synthetic division to write \\(f(x)=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(12x^{2}-12 x+12\\right)\\), or \\(f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)\\). Since the zeros of \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) are nonreal, we call \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) an **irreducible quadratic** meaning it is impossible to break it down any further using _real_ numbers.

Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\).

Before we can combine the logarithms, however, we need a common base. Since 4 is a power of 2, we use change of base to convert \\[\\log_{4}(x+1)=\\frac{\\log_{2}(x+1)}{\\log_{2}(4)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Hence, our original equation becomes \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\right)\\] \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Power Rule \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}\\right)\\] Quotient Rule Rewriting this in exponential form, we get \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}=2\\) or \\(x^{2}-2x-2=0\\).

Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\).

We define \\(r(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(x)+1}\\) and set about finding the domain and the zeros of \\(r\\). Due to the appearance of the term \\(\\ln(x)\\), we require \\(x>0\\). In order to keep the denominator away from zero, we solve \\(\\ln(x)+1=0\\) so \\(\\ln(x)=-1\\), so \\(x=e^{-1}=\\frac{1}{e}\\). Hence, the domain of \\(r\\) is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{1}{e},\\infty\\right)\\). To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(x)+1}=0\\) so that \\(\\ln(x)=0\\), and we find \\(x=e^{0}=1\\). In order to determine test values for \\(r\\) without resorting to the calculator, we need to find numbers between \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{1}{e}\\), and \\(1\\) which have a base of \\(e\\). Since \\(e\\approx 2.718>1\\), \\(0<\\frac{1}{e^{2}}<\\frac{1}{e}<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e}}<1<e\\). To determine the sign of \\(r\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)\\), we use the fact that \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)=\\ln\\left(e^{-2}\\right)=-2\\), and find \\(r\\left(\\frac{1}{e^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{-2}{-2+1}=2\\), which is \\((+)\\). The rest of the test values are determined similarly. From our sign diagram, we find the solution to be \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{e}\\right)\\cup[1,\\infty)\\). Graphing \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\ln(x)+1}\\) and \\(g(x)=1\\), we see the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\) on the solution intervals, and that the graphs intersect at \\(x=1\\).\n2. Moving all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}<2\\log_{2}(x)+3\\) to one side of the inequality, we have \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3<0\\). Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\), we get \\(\\log_{2}(x)=-1\\), which gives us \\(x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\log_{2}(x)=3\\), which yields \\(x=2^{3}=8\\). We use test values which are powers of \\(2\\): \\(0<\\frac{1}{4}<\\frac{1}{2}<1<8<16\\), and from our sign diagram, we see \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},8\\right)\\). Geometrically, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{2}\\) is below the graph of \\(y=g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\) on the solution interval.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 6.1.3**.: Simplify the following.\n1. \\(\\log_{3}(81)\\) \\[2. \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) 3. \\log_{\\sqrt{5}}(25)\\] 4. \\(\\ln\\left(\\sqrt[3]{e^{2}}\\right)\\)\n2. \\(\\log(0.001)\\) \\[6. 2^{\\log_{2}(8)} 7. 117^{-\\log_{117}(6)}\\]\n**Solution.**\n1. The number \\(\\log_{3}(81)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(3\\) to get \\(81\\). As such, we want to write \\(81\\) as a power of \\(3\\). We find \\(81=3^{4}\\), so that \\(\\log_{3}(81)=4\\).\n2. To find \\(\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\), we need rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) as a power of \\(2\\). We find \\(\\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2^{3}}=2^{-3}\\), so \\(\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)=-3\\).\n3. To determine \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{5}}(25)\\), we need to express \\(25\\) as a power of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\). We know \\(25=5^{2}\\), and \\(5=\\left(\\sqrt{5}\\right)^{2}\\), so we have \\(25=\\left(\\left(\\sqrt{5}\\right)^{2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\sqrt{5}\\right)^{4}\\). We get \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{5}}(25)=4\\).\n4. First, recall that the notation \\(\\ln\\left(\\sqrt[3]{e^{2}}\\right)\\) means \\(\\log_{e}\\left(\\sqrt[3]{e^{2}}\\right)\\), so we are looking for the exponent to put on \\(e\\) to obtain \\(\\sqrt[3]{e^{2}}\\). Rewriting \\(\\sqrt[3]{e^{2}}=e^{2/3}\\), we find \\(\\ln\\left(\\sqrt[3]{e^{2}}\\right)=\\ln\\left(e^{2/3}\\right)=\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n5. Rewriting \\(\\log(0.001)\\) as \\(\\log_{10}(0.001)\\), we see that we need to write \\(0.001\\) as a power of \\(10\\). We have \\(0.001=\\frac{1}{1000}=\\frac{1}{10^{3}}=10^{-3}\\). Hence, \\(\\log(0.001)=\\log\\left(10^{-3}\\right)=-3\\).\n6. We can use Theorem 6.2 directly to simplify \\(2^{\\log_{2}(8)}=8\\). We can also understand this problem by first finding \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\). By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(2\\) to get \\(8\\). Since \\(8=2^{3}\\), we have \\(\\log_{2}(8)=3\\). We now substitute to find \\(2^{\\log_{2}(8)}=2^{3}=8\\).\n7. From Theorem 6.2, we know \\(117^{\\log_{117}(6)}=6\\), but we cannot directly apply this formula to the expression \\(117^{-\\log_{117}(6)}\\). (Can you see why?) At this point, we use a property of exponents followed by Theorem 6.2 to get9 Footnote 9: It is worth a moment of your time to think your way through why \\(117^{\\log_{117}(6)}=6\\). By definition, \\(\\log_{117}(6)\\) is the exponent we put on \\(117\\) to get \\(6\\). What are we doing with this exponent? We are putting it on \\(117\\). By definition we get \\(6\\). In other words, the exponential function \\(f(x)=117^{x}\\) undoes the logarithmic function \\(g(x)=\\log_{117}(x)\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. Since we have the same base on both sides of the equation \\(\\log_{117}(1-3x)=\\log_{117}\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\), we equate what's inside the logs to get \\(1-3x=x^{2}-3\\). Solving \\(x^{2}+3x-4=0\\) gives \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=1\\). To check these answers using the calculator, we make use of the change of base formula and graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-3x)}{\\ln(117)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)}{\\ln(117)}\\) and we see they intersect only at \\(x=-4\\). To see what happened to the solution \\(x=1\\), we substitute it into our original equation to obtain \\(\\log_{117}(-2)=\\log_{117}(-2)\\). While these expressions look identical, neither is a real number,1 which means \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of the original equation, and is not a solution. Footnote 1: They do, however, represent the same **family** of complex numbers. We stop ourselves at this point and refer the reader to a good course in Complex Variables.\n2. Our first objective in solving \\(2-\\ln(x-3)=1\\) is to isolate the logarithm. We get \\(\\ln(x-3)=1\\), which, as an exponential equation, is \\(e^{1}=x-3\\). We get our solution \\(x=e+3\\). On the calculator, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=2-\\ln(x-3)\\) intersects the graph of \\(g(x)=1\\) at \\(x=e+3\\approx 5.718\\).\n3. We can start solving \\(\\log_{6}(x+4)+\\log_{6}(3-x)=1\\) by using the Product Rule for logarithms to rewrite the equation as \\(\\log_{6}\\left[(x+4)(3-x)\\right]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation, we get \\(6^{1}=(x+4)(3-x)\\). This reduces to \\(x^{2}+x-6=0\\), which gives \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\). Graphing \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+4)}{\\ln(6)}+\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(6)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1\\), we see they intersect twice, at \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\).\n4. Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n\n\n",

This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution.

If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\).

How fast is the water level rising when the water is \\(4\\) cm deep (at its deepest point)?\nThe water forms a conical shape within the big cone; its height and base radius and volume are all increasing as water is poured into the container. This means that we actually have three things varying with time: the water level \\(h\\) (the height of the cone of water), the radius \\(r\\) of the circular top surface of water (the base radius of the cone of water), and the volume of water \\(V\\). The volume of a cone is given by \\(V=\\pi r^{2}h/3\\). We know \\(dV/dt\\), and we want \\(dh/dt\\).

Hence, the graph of \\(y=-f(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(x\\)-axis. Similarly, the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis. Returning to the language of inputs and outputs, multiplying the output from a function by \\(-1\\) reflects its graph across the \\(x\\)-axis, while multiplying the input to a function by \\(-1\\) reflects the graph across the \\(y\\)-axis.4\n**Theorem 1.4**.: **Reflections.** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function.\n* To graph \\(y=-f(x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\n* To graph \\(y=f(-x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\nApplying Theorem 1.4 to the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) given at the beginning of the section, we can graph \\(y=-f(x)\\) by reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis\nBy reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis, we obtain the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\).\nWith the addition of reflections, it is now more important than ever to consider the order of transformations, as the next example illustrates.\n**Example 1.7.2**.: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Use the graph of \\(f\\) from Example 1.7.1 to graph the following functions. Also, state their domains and ranges.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. The mere sight of \\(\\sqrt{-x}\\) usually causes alarm, if not panic. When we discussed domains in Section 1.4, we clearly banished negatives from the radicands of even roots. However, we must remember that \\(x\\) is a variable, and as such, the quantity \\(-x\\) isn't always negative. For example, if \\(x=-4\\), \\(-x=4\\), thus \\(\\sqrt{-x}=\\sqrt{-(-4)}=2\\) is perfectly well-defined. To find the domain analytically, we set \\(-x\\geq 0\\) which gives \\(x\\leq 0\\), so that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,0]\\). Since \\(g(x)=f(-x)\\), Theorem 1.4 tells us that the graph of \\(g\\) is the reflection of the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis. We accomplish this by multiplying each \\(x\\)-coordinate on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\), so that the points \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,1)\\), and \\((4,2)\\) move to \\((0,0)\\), \\((-1,1)\\), and \\((-4,2)\\), respectively. Graphically, we see that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,0]\\) and the range of \\(g\\) is the same as the range of \\(f\\), namely \\([0,\\infty)\\). 2. To determine the domain of \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{3-x}\\), we solve \\(3-x\\geq 0\\) and get \\(x\\leq 3\\), or \\((-\\infty,3]\\). To determine which transformations we need to apply to the graph of \\(f\\) to obtain the graph of \\(j\\), we rewrite \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{-x+3}=f(-x+3)\\). Comparing this formula with \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we see that not only are we multiplying the input \\(x\\) by \\(-1\\), which results in a reflection across the \\(y\\)-axis, but also we are adding \\(3\\), which indicates a horizontal shift to the left. Does it matter in which order we do the transformations? If so, which order is the correct order? Let's consider the point \\((4,2)\\) on the graph of \\(f\\). We refer to the discussion leading up to Theorem 1.3. We know \\(f(4)=2\\) and wish to find the point on \\(y=j(x)=f(-x+3)\\) which corresponds to \\((4,2)\\). We set \\(-x+3=4\\) and solve. Our first step is to subtract \\(3\\) from both sides to get \\(-x=1\\). Subtracting \\(3\\) from the \\(x\\)-coordinate \\(4\\) is shifting the point \\((4,2)\\) to the left. From \\(-x=1\\), we then multiply5 both sides by \\(-1\\) to get \\(x=-1\\). Multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinate by \\(-1\\) corresponds to reflecting the point about the \\(y\\)-axis. Hence, we perform the horizontal shift first, then follow it with the reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. Starting with \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we let \\(j_{1}(x)\\) be the intermediate function which shifts the graph of \\(f\\)\\(3\\) units to the left, \\(j_{1}(x)=f(x+3)\\). Footnote 5: Or divide - it amounts to the same thing.\nTo obtain the function \\(j\\), we reflect the graph of \\(j_{1}\\) about \\(y\\)-axis. Theorem 1.4 tells us we have \\(j(x)=j_{1}(-x)\\). Putting it all together, we have \\(j(x)=j_{1}(-x)=f(-x+3)=\\sqrt{-x+3}\\), which is what we want.6 From the graph, we confirm the domain of \\(j\\) is \\((-\\infty,3]\\) and we get that the range is \\([0,\\infty)\\). Footnote 6: If we had done the reflection first, then \\(j_{1}(x)=f(-x)\\). Following this by a shift left would give us \\(j(x)=j_{1}(x+3)=f(-(x+3))=f(-x-3)=\\sqrt{-x-3}\\) which isn’t what we want. However, if we did the reflection first and followed it by a shift to the right 3 units, we would have arrived at the function \\(j(x)\\). We leave it to the reader to verify the details.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nKeep in mind that we can check our answer to any of these kinds of problems by showing that any of the points we've moved lie on the graph of our final answer. For example, we can check that \\((-3,-2)\\) is on the graph of \\(m\\) by computing \\(m(-3)=\\sqrt{(-3)+3}-2=\\sqrt{0}-2=-2\\,\\checkmark\\)\nWe now turn our attention to reflections. We know from Section 1.1 that to reflect a point \\((x,y)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis, we replace \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\). If \\((x,y)\\) is on the graph of \\(f\\), then \\(y=f(x)\\), so replacing \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\) is the same as replacing \\(f(x)\\) with \\(-f(x)\\). Hence, the graph of \\(y=-f(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(x\\)-axis. Similarly, the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis. Returning to the language of inputs and outputs, multiplying the output from a function by \\(-1\\) reflects its graph across the \\(x\\)-axis, while multiplying the input to a function by \\(-1\\) reflects the graph across the \\(y\\)-axis.4\n**Theorem 1.4**.: **Reflections.** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function.\n* To graph \\(y=-f(x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\n* To graph \\(y=f(-x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n6. Lastly, we construct a sign diagram for \\(f(x)\\). The \\(x\\)-values excluded from the domain of \\(f\\) are \\(x=\\pm 2\\), and the only zero of \\(f\\) is \\(x=0\\). Displaying these appropriately on the number line gives us four test intervals, and we choose the test values8\\(x=-3\\), \\(x=-1\\), \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3\\). We find \\(f(-3)\\) is \\((-)\\), \\(f(-1)\\) is \\((+)\\), \\(f(1)\\) is \\((-)\\) and \\(f(3)\\) is \\((+)\\). Combining this with our previous work, we get the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) below.\nFootnote 8: In this particular case, we can eschew test values, since our analysis of the behavior of \\(f\\) near the vertical asymptotes and our end behavior analysis have given us the signs on each of the test intervals. In general, however, this won’t always be the case, so for demonstration purposes, we continue with our usual construction.\nA couple of notes are in order. First, the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) certainly seems to possess symmetry with respect to the origin. In fact, we can check \\(f(-x)=-f(x)\\) to see that \\(f\\) is an odd function. In some textbooks, checking for symmetry is part of the standard procedure for graphing rational functions; but since it happens comparatively rarely9 we'll just point it out when we see it. Also note that while \\(y=0\\) is the horizontal asymptote, the graph of \\(f\\) actually crosses the \\(x\\)-axis at \\((0,0)\\). The myth that graphs of rational functions can't cross their horizontal asymptotes is completely false,10 as we shall see again in our next example.\nFootnote 9: And Jeff doesn’t think much of it to begin with...\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Solution.** We have \\(r=3\\) which gives the equations \\(\\{x=3(t-\\sin(t)),\\,y=3(1-\\cos(t))\\,\\) for \\(t\\geq 0\\). (Here we have returned to the convention of using \\(t\\) as the parameter.) Sketching the cycloid by hand is a wonderful exercise in Calculus, but for the purposes of this book, we use a graphing utility. Using a calculator to graph parametric equations is very similar to graphing polar equations on a calculator.13 Ensuring that the calculator is in 'Parametric Mode' and 'radian mode' we enter the equations and advance to the 'Window' screen.\nFootnote 13: See page 959 in Section 11.5.\nAs always, the challenge is to determine appropriate bounds on the parameter, \\(t\\), as well as for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We know that one full revolution of the circle occurs over the interval \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\), so\nit seems reasonable to keep these as our bounds on \\(t\\). The 'Tstep' seems reasonably small - too large a value here can lead to incorrect graphs.14 We know from our derivation of the equations of the cycloid that the center of the generating circle has coordinates \\((r\\theta,r)\\), or in this case, \\((3t,3)\\). Since \\(t\\) ranges between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\), we set \\(x\\) to range between \\(0\\) and \\(6\\pi\\). The values of \\(y\\) go from the bottom of the circle to the top, so \\(y\\) ranges between \\(0\\) and \\(6\\).\n\n\n",

In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\nTo summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n3. The London Eye is a popular tourist attraction in London, England and is one of the largest Ferris Wheels in the world. It has a diameter of 135 meters and makes one revolution (counter-clockwise) every 30 minutes. It is constructed so that the lowest part of the Eye reaches ground level, enabling passengers to simply walk on to, and off of, the ride. Find a sinusoid which models the height \\(h\\) of the passenger above the ground in meters \\(t\\) minutes after they board the Eye at ground level.\n4. On page 732 in Section 10.2.1, we found the \\(x\\)-coordinate of counter-clockwise motion on a circle of radius \\(r\\) with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) to be \\(x=r\\cos(\\omega t)\\), where \\(t=0\\) corresponds to the point \\((r,0)\\). Suppose we are in the situation of Exercise 3 above. Find a sinusoid which models the horizontal _displacement_\\(x\\) of the passenger from the center of the Eye in meters \\(t\\) minutes after they board the Eye. Here we take \\(x(t)>0\\) to mean the passenger is to the _right_ of the center, while \\(x(t)<0\\) means the passenger is to the _left_ of the center.\n5. In Exercise 52 in Section 10.1, we introduced the yo-yo trick 'Around the World' in which a yo-yo is thrown so it sweeps out a vertical circle. As in that exercise, suppose the yo-yo string is 28 inches and it completes one revolution in 3 seconds. If the closest the yo-yo ever gets to the ground is 2 inches, find a sinusoid which models the height \\(h\\) of the yo-yo above the ground in inches \\(t\\) seconds after it leaves its lowest point.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe know from the equations given on page 11 in Section 10.2.1 that the \\(y\\)-coordinate for counter-clockwise motion on a circle of radius \\(r\\) centered at the origin with constant angular velocity (frequency) \\(\\omega\\) is given by \\(y=r\\sin(\\omega t)\\). Here, \\(t=0\\) corresponds to the point \\((r,0)\\) so that \\(\\theta\\), the angle measuring the amount of rotation, is in standard position. In our case, the diameter of the wheel is 128 feet, so the radius is \\(r=64\\) feet. Since the wheel completes two revolutions in 2 minutes and 7 seconds (which is 127 seconds) the period \\(T=\\frac{1}{2}(127)=\\frac{127}{2}\\) seconds. Hence, the angular frequency is \\(\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{T}=\\frac{4\\pi}{127}\\) radians per second. Putting these two pieces of information together, we have that \\(y=64\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{127}t\\right)\\) describes the \\(y\\)-coordinate on the Giant Wheel after \\(t\\) seconds, assuming it is centered at \\((0,0)\\) with \\(t=0\\) corresponding to the point \\(Q\\). In order to find an expression for \\(h\\), we take the point \\(O\\) in the figure as the origin. Since the base of the Giant Wheel ride is 8 feet above the ground and the Giant Wheel itself has a radius of 64 feet, its center is 72 feet above the ground. To account for this vertical shift upward,4 we add 72 to our formula for \\(y\\) to obtain the new formula \\(h=y+72=64\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{127}t\\right)+72\\). Next, we need to adjust things so that \\(t=0\\) corresponds to the point \\(P\\) instead of the point \\(Q\\). This is where the phase comes into play. Geometrically, we need to shift the angle \\(\\theta\\) in the figure back \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians. From Section 10.2.1, we know \\(\\theta=\\omega t=\\frac{4\\pi}{127}t\\), so we (temporarily) write the height in terms of \\(\\theta\\) as \\(h=64\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)+72\\). Subtracting \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) from \\(\\theta\\) gives the final answer \\(h(t)=64\\sin\\left(\\theta-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)+72=64\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{127}t -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)+72\\). We can check the reasonableness of our answer by graphing \\(y=h(t)\\) over the interval \\(\\left[0,\\frac{127}{2}\\right]\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nOur goal is to find parametric equations for the coordinates of the point \\(P(x,y)\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\). From our work in Example 11.10.4 number 3, we know that clockwise motion along the Unit Circle starting at the point \\((0,-1)\\) can be modeled by the equations \\(\\{x=-\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-\\cos(\\theta)\\) for \\(0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi\\). (We have renamed the parameter '\\(\\theta\\)' to match the context of this problem.) To model this motion on a circle of radius \\(r\\), all we need to do11 is multiply both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by the factor \\(r\\) which yields \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\). We now need to adjust for the fact that the circle isn't stationary with center \\((0,0)\\), but rather, is rolling along the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Since the velocity \\(v\\) is constant, we know that at time \\(t\\), the center of the circle has traveled a distance \\(vt\\) down the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Furthermore, since the radius of the circle is \\(r\\) and the circle isn't moving vertically, we know that the center of the circle is always \\(r\\) units above the \\(x\\)-axis. Putting these two facts together, we have that at time \\(t\\), the center of the circle is at the point \\((vt,r)\\). From Section 10.1.1, we know \\(v=\\frac{r\\theta}{t}\\), or \\(vt=r\\theta\\). Hence, the center of the circle, in terms of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), is \\((r\\theta,r)\\). As a result, we need to modify the equations \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta),\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\) by shifting the \\(x\\)-coordinate to the right \\(r\\theta\\) units (by adding \\(r\\theta\\) to the expression for \\(x\\)) and the \\(y\\)-coordinate up \\(r\\) units12 (by adding \\(r\\) to the expression for \\(y\\)). We get \\(\\{x=-r\\sin(\\theta)+r\\theta,\\,y=-r\\cos(\\theta)+r\\,,\\) which can be written as \\(\\{x=r(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta)),\\,y=r(1-\\cos(\\theta))\\,\\). Since the motion starts at \\(\\theta=0\\) and proceeds indefinitely, we set \\(\\theta\\geq 0\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Equation 10.2. Velocity for Circular Motion:** For an object moving on a circular path of radius \\(r\\) with constant angular velocity \\(\\omega\\), the (linear) velocity of the object is given by \\(v=r\\omega\\).\nWe need to talk about units here. The units of \\(v\\) are \\(\\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{time}}\\), the units of \\(r\\) are length only, and the units of \\(\\omega\\) are \\(\\frac{\\text{radians}}{\\text{time}}\\). Thus the left hand side of the equation \\(v=r\\omega\\) has units \\(\\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{time}}\\), whereas the right hand side has units \\(\\text{length}\\cdot\\frac{\\text{radians}}{\\text{time}}=\\frac{\\text{length} \\cdot\\text{radians}}{\\text{time}}\\). The supposed contradiction in units is resolved by remembering that radians are a dimensionless quantity and angles in radian measure are identified with real numbers so that the units \\(\\frac{\\text{length}\\cdot\\text{radians}}{\\text{time}}\\) reduce to the units \\(\\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{time}}\\). We are long overdue for an example.\n**Example 10.1.5.** Assuming that the surface of the Earth is a sphere, any point on the Earth can be thought of as an object traveling on a circle which completes one revolution in (approximately) 24 hours. The path traced out by the point during this 24 hour period is the Latitude of that point. Lakeland Community College is at 41.628\\({}^{\\circ}\\) north latitude, and it can be shown19 that the radius of the earth at this Latitude is approximately 2960 miles. Find the linear velocity, in miles per hour, of Lakeland Community College as the world turns.\nFootnote 19: We will discuss how we arrived at this approximation in Example 10.2.6.\n\n\n",

If \\({\\bf F}\\) is a conservative force field, then the integral for work, \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\), is in the form required by the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals. This means that in a conservative force field, the amount of work required to move an object from point \\({\\bf a}\\) to point \\({\\bf b}\\) depends only on those points, not on the path taken between them.\n**Example 16.3.2**: An object moves in the force field\n\\[{\\bf F}=\\left\\langle\\frac{-x}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-y}{(x^{2}+y^{ 2}+z^{2})^{3/2}},\\frac{-z}{(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}}\\right\\rangle,\\]\nalong the curve \\({\\bf r}=\\langle 1+t,t^{3},t\\cos(\\pi t)\\rangle\\) as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\).

But since \\({\\bf F}=\\nabla(1/\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}})\\) we need only substitute:\n\\[\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\left.\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}\\right| _{(1,0,0)}^{(2,1,-1)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}-1.\\]\n### The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals\nAnother immediate consequence of the Fundamental Theorem involves **closed paths**.

What is the limit of $g(x)/x$ as $x$ goes to infinity?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\nwe don't have to worry about it ever again. When we say that \\(x\\) might be \"complicated\" we really mean that in practice it might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:\n**Theorem 2.3.5** Suppose \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\). Then\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\n_Proof._ We have to use the official definition of limit to make sense of this. So given any \\(\\epsilon\\) we need to find a \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|f(x)g(x)-LM|<\\epsilon\\). What do we have to work with? We know that we can make \\(f(x)\\) close to \\(L\\) and \\(g(x)\\) close to \\(M\\), and we have to somehow connect these facts to make \\(f(x)g(x)\\) close to \\(LM\\).\nWe use, as is so often the case, a little algebraic trick:\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&=|f(x)g(x)-f(x)M+f(x)M-LM|\\cr&=|f(x)(g(x)-M)+(f(x)-L)M| \\cr&\\leq|f(x)(g(x)-M)|+|(f(x)-L)M|\\cr&=|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|.\\cr}\\]\nThis is all straightforward except perhaps for the \"\\(\\leq\\)\". That is an example of the **triangle inequality**, which says that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers then \\(|a+b|\\leq|a|+|b|\\). If you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow this looks exactly like a derivative, namely \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\), that is, the function \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g(x)\\). If this all withstands scrutiny, we then get\n\\[{d\\over dx}f(g(x))=f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x).\\]\nUnfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what we mean by \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\) involves what happens when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 _but not equal to 0_. The qualification is very important, since we must be able to divide by \\(\\Delta x\\). But when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 but not equal to 0, \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x))-g(x)\\) is close to 0 _and possibly equal to 0_. This means it doesn't really make sense to divide by \\(\\Delta g\\). Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to avoid this difficulty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details, which can be found in many calculus books. Note that many functions \\(g\\) do have the property that \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\neq 0\\) when \\(\\Delta x\\) is small, and for these functions the argument above is fine.\nThe chain rule has a particularly simple expression if we use the Leibniz notation for the derivative. The quantity \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\) is the derivative of \\(f\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g\\); this can be written \\(df/dg\\). As usual, \\(g^{\\prime}(x)=dg/dx\\). Then the chain rule becomes\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nTo do this we need to be quite clever, and to employ some indirect reasoning. The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\n\n\n",

First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well.

We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nFigure 2.5.1: Function Types: (a) a discontinuous function, (b) a continuous function, (c) a bounded, differentiable function, (d) an unbounded, differentiable function\n**Definition 2.5.2**: **Continuous at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(a\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.3**: **Continuous** A function \\(f\\) is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. \\(\\Box\\)\nStrangely, we also say that (d) is continuous even though there is a vertical asymptote. A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n**Definition 2.5.4**: **Differentiable at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable at point \\(a\\) if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) exists. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.5**: **Differentiable** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable if is differentiable at every point (excluding endpoints and isolated points in the domain of \\(f\\)) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nTake note that, for technical reasons not discussed here, both of these definitions exclude endpoints and isolated points in the domain from consideration.\nWe close with a useful theorem about continuous functions:\n**Theorem 2.5.6**: **Intermediate Value Theorem** If \\(f\\) is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\) and \\(d\\) is between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\), then there is a number \\(c\\) in \\([a,b]\\) such that \\(f(c)=d\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\nThis is most frequently used when \\(d=0\\).\n**Example 2.5.7**: **Explain why the function \\(f=x^{3}+3x^{2}+x-2\\) has a root between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\nBy theorem 2.3.6, \\(f\\) is continuous. Since \\(f(0)=-2\\) and \\(f(1)=3\\), and \\(0\\) is between \\(-2\\) and \\(3\\), there is a \\(c\\in[0,1]\\) such that \\(f(c)=0\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThis example also points the way to a simple method for approximating roots.\n**Example 2.5.8**: **Approximate the root of the previous example to one decimal place.**\nIf we compute \\(f(0.1)\\), \\(f(0.2)\\), and so on, we find that \\(f(0.6)<0\\) and \\(f(0.7)>0\\), so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, \\(f\\) has a root between \\(0.6\\) and \\(0.7\\).

Section 9.9 investigates arc length for functions given as \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), and develops the formula for length:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx.\\]\nUsing some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can convert this to use parametric equations \\(x=f(t)\\), \\(y=g(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;dx&=\\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}\\left( \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2}}\\;\\frac{dt}{dx}\\;dx\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v}\\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^{2}}\\;dt\\cr&=\\int_{u}^{v} \\sqrt{(f^{\\prime}(t))^{2}+(g^{\\prime}(t))^{2}}\\;dt.}\\]\nHere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the \\(t\\) limits corresponding to the \\(x\\) limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n**EXAMPLE 10.5.3** Find the length of one arch of the cycloid.

A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n**Definition 2.5.4**: **Differentiable at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable at point \\(a\\) if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) exists. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.5**: **Differentiable** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable if is differentiable at every point (excluding endpoints and isolated points in the domain of \\(f\\)) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined.

First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe have already seen a family of periodic functions in Section 2.1: the constant functions. However, despite being periodic a constant function has no period. (We'll leave that odd gem as an exercise for you.) Returning to the circular functions, we see that by Definition 10.3, \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) is periodic, since \\(\\cos(t+2\\pi k)=\\cos(t)\\) for any integer \\(k\\). To determine the period of \\(f\\), we need to find the smallest real number \\(p\\) so that \\(f(t+p)=f(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\) or, said differently, the smallest positive real number \\(p\\) such that \\(\\cos(t+p)=\\cos(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\). We know that \\(\\cos(t+2\\pi)=\\cos(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\) but the question remains if any smaller real number will do the trick. Suppose \\(p>0\\) and \\(\\cos(t+p)=\\cos(t)\\) for all real numbers \\(t\\). Then, in particular, \\(\\cos(0+p)=\\cos(0)\\) so that \\(\\cos(p)=1\\). From this we know \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) and, since the smallest positive multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) is \\(2\\pi\\) itself, we have the result. Similarly, we can show \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) is also periodic with \\(2\\pi\\) as its period.2 Having period \\(2\\pi\\) essentially means that we can completely understand everything about the functions \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) and \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) by studying one interval of length \\(2\\pi\\), say \\([0,2\\pi]\\).3\nFootnote 2: Alternatively, we can use the Cofunction Identities in Theorem 10.14 to show that \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\) since \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t\\right)\\).\nFootnote 3: Technically, we should study the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\),4 since whatever happens at \\(t=2\\pi\\) is the same as what happens at \\(t=0\\). As we will see shortly, \\(t=2\\pi\\) gives us an extra ‘check’ when we go to graph these functions.\nFootnote 4: In some advanced texts, the interval of choice is \\([-\\pi,\\pi)\\).\nOne last property of the functions \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) and \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) is worth pointing out: both of these functions are continuous and smooth. Recall from Section 3.1 that geometrically this means the graphs of the cosine and sine functions have no jumps, gaps, holes in the graph, asymptotes,\ncorners or cusps. As we shall see, the graphs of both \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) and \\(g(t)=\\sin(t)\\) meander nicely and don't cause any trouble. We summarize these facts in the following theorem.\n**Theorem 10.22.

This vector function traces out precisely \\(y=\\ln x\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle 1,1/t,0\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+1/t^{2}}\\) and the desired length is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{t^{2}}}\\,dt=2-\\sqrt{2}+\\ln(\\sqrt{2}+1)- \\frac{1}{2}\\ln 3.\\]\n(This integral is a bit tricky, but requires only methods we have learned.) \\(\\Box\\)\nNotice that there is nothing special about \\(y=\\ln x\\), except that the resulting integral can be computed. In general, given any \\(y=f(x)\\), we can think of this as the vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle t,f(t),0\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle 1,f^{\\prime}(t),0\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime})^{2}}\\). The length of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is thus\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, such integrals are often impossible to do exactly and must be approximated.\nOne useful application of arc length is the **arc length parameterization**. A vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) gives the position of a point in terms of the parameter \\(t\\), which is often time, but need not be. Suppose \\(s\\) is the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use \\(s\\) for the variable, we get \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), the position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has traveled.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nwe have considered.

This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\).

Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThis says simply that the size of \\(a_{n}\\) gets close to zero if and only if \\(a_{n}\\) gets close to zero.\n**Example 11.1.5**.: Determine whether \\(\\left\\{\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges.

Hence \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\nwe don't have to worry about it ever again.

Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n5. The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check, we note \\[\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of tangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= -3\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2})}\\] To determine which of our answers lie in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we first need to get an idea of the value of \\(2\\arctan(-3)\\). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\). Since this is outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we discard \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\) and all solutions of the form \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for \\(k>2\\). Graphically, we see \\(y=\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\) and \\(y=-3\\) intersect only once on \\([0,2\\pi)\\) at \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\approx 3.7851\\). Footnote 5: Your instructor will let you know if you should abandon the analytic route at this point and use your calculator. But seriously, what fun would that be?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nSince \\(-2\\) isn't the tangent of any of the 'common angles', we need to use the arctangent function to express our answers. The real number \\(t=\\arctan(-2)\\) satisfies \\(\\tan(t)=-2\\) and \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\). If we let \\(\\beta=\\arctan(-2)\\) radians, we see that all of the Quadrant IV solutions\nto \\(\\tan(\\theta)=-2\\) are coterminal with \\(\\beta\\). Moreover, the solutions from Quadrant II differ by exactly \\(\\pi\\) units from the solutions in Quadrant IV, so all the solutions to \\(\\tan(\\theta)=-2\\) are of the form \\(\\theta=\\beta+\\pi k=\\arctan(-2)+\\pi k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Switching back to the variable \\(t\\), we record our final answer to \\(\\tan(t)=-2\\) as \\(t=\\arctan(-2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\n3. The last equation we are asked to solve, \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), poses two immediate problems. First, we are not told whether or not \\(x\\) represents an angle or a real number. We assume the latter, but note that we will use angles and the Unit Circle to solve the equation regardless. Second, as we have mentioned, there is no universally accepted range of the arcsecant function. For that reason, we adopt the advice given in Section 10.3 and convert this to the cosine problem \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Adopting an angle approach, we consider the equation \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and note that our solutions lie in Quadrants II and III. Since \\(-\\frac{3}{5}\\) isn't the cosine of any of the 'common angles', we'll need to express our solutions in terms of the arccosine function. The real number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) is defined so that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). If we let \\(\\beta=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) radians, we see that \\(\\beta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. To obtain a Quadrant III angle solution, we may simply use \\(-\\beta=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\). Since all angle solutions are coterminal with \\(\\beta\\) or \\(-\\beta\\), we get our solutions to \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) to be \\(\\theta=\\beta+2\\pi k=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=-\\beta+2\\pi k=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Switching back to the variable \\(x\\), we record our final answer to \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\) as \\(x=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n47. \\(\\tan(\\theta)=0\\) when \\(\\theta=\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n48. \\(\\sec(\\theta)=1\\) when \\(\\theta=2\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n49. \\(\\csc(\\theta)=2\\) when \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\).\n50. \\(\\cot(\\theta)=0\\) when \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n51. \\(\\tan(\\theta)=-1\\) when \\(\\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n52. \\(\\sec(\\theta)=0\\) never happens\n53. \\(\\csc(\\theta)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) never happens\n54. \\(\\sec(\\theta)=-1\\) when \\(\\theta=\\pi+2\\pi k=(2k+1)\\pi\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n55. \\(\\tan(\\theta)=-\\sqrt{3}\\) when \\(\\theta=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n56. \\(\\csc(\\theta)=-2\\) when \\(\\theta=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n57. \\(\\cot(\\theta)=-1\\) when \\(\\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n58. \\(\\cot(t)=1\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n59. \\(\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n60. \\(\\sec(t)=-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) when \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(t=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n61. \\(\\csc(t)=0\\) never happens\n62. \\(\\cot(t)=-\\sqrt{3}\\) when \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n63. \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) when \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n64. \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(t=\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n65. \\(\\csc(t)=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(t=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for any integer \\(k\\)\n66. \\(\\theta=30^{\\circ}\\), \\(a=3\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(c=\\sqrt{108}=6\\sqrt{3}\\)\n67. \\(\\alpha=56^{\\circ}\\), \\(b=12\\tan(34^{\\circ})=8.094\\), \\(c=12\\sec(34^{\\circ})=\\frac{12}{\\cos(34^{\\circ})}\\approx 14.475\\)\n68. \\(\\theta=43^{\\circ}\\), \\(a=6\\cot(47^{\\circ})=\\frac{6}{\\tan(47^{\\circ})}\\approx 5.595\\), \\(c=6\\csc(47^{\\circ})=\\frac{6}{\\sin(47^{\\circ})}\\approx 8.204\\)\n69. \\(\\beta=40^{\\circ}\\), \\(b=2.5\\tan(50^{\\circ})\\approx 2.979\\), \\(c=2.5\\sec(50^{\\circ})=\\frac{2.5}{\\cos(50^{\\circ})}\\approx 3.889\\)\n70.

It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\).

Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other.

Again it's clear that more generally \\((a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}\\), and again this gives us a fact about logarithms. If \\(A=a^{x}\\) then \\(A^{y}=(a^{x})^{y}=a^{xy}\\), so \\(\\log_{a}(A^{y})=xy=y\\log_{a}(A)\\)--the exponent can be \"pulled out in front.\"\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 4.6 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions\nAn exponential function has the form \\(a^{x}\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant; examples are \\(2^{x}\\), \\(10^{x}\\), \\(e^{x}\\). The logarithmic functions are the **inverses** of the exponential functions, that is, functions that \"undo\" the exponential functions, just as, for example, the cube root function \"undoes\" the cube function: \\(\\sqrt[3]{2^{3}}=2\\). Note that the original function also undoes the inverse function: \\((\\sqrt[3]{8})^{3}=8\\).\nLet \\(f(x)=2^{x}\\). The inverse of this function is called the logarithm base 2, denoted \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) or (especially in computer science circles) \\(\\lg(x)\\). What does this really mean? The logarithm must undo the action of the exponential function, so for example it must be that \\(\\lg(2^{3})=3\\)--starting with 3, the exponential function produces \\(2^{3}=8\\), and the logarithm of 8 must get us back to 3. A little thought shows that it is not a coincidence that \\(\\lg(2^{3})\\) simply gives the exponent--the exponent _is_ the original value that we must get back to. In other words, _the logarithm is the exponent_. Remember this catchphrase, and what it means, and you won't go wrong. (You _do_ have to remember what it means. Like any good mnemonic, \"the logarithm is the exponent\" leaves out a lot of detail, like \"Which exponent?\" and \"Exponent of what?\")\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. \\(75=\\frac{100}{1+3e^{-2t}}\\) \\[5.\\ 25^{x}=5^{x}+6\\] \\[6.\\ \\frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2}=5\\]\n**Solution.**\n1. Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\).

We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\).

Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. To determine the domain of \\(j\\), we solve \\(9x\\geq 0\\) to find \\(x\\geq 0\\). Our domain is once again \\([0,\\infty)\\). We recognize \\(j(x)=f(9x)\\) and by Theorem 1.6, we obtain the graph of \\(j\\) by dividing the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(9\\). From the graph, we see the range of \\(j\\) is also \\([0,\\infty)\\).\n3. Solving \\(\\frac{x+3}{2}\\geq 0\\) gives \\(x\\geq-3\\), so the domain of \\(m\\) is \\([-3,\\infty)\\). To take advantage of what we know of transformations, we rewrite \\(m(x)=-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}}+1\\), or \\(m(x)=-f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+1\\). Focusing on the inputs first, we note that the input to \\(f\\) in the formula for \\(m(x)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\). Multiplying the \\(x\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) corresponds to a horizontal stretching by a factor of \\(2\\), and adding the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) corresponds to a shift to the left by \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). As before, we resolve which to perform first by thinking about how we would find the point on \\(m\\) corresponding to a point on \\(f\\), in this case, \\((4,2)\\). To use \\(f(4)=2\\), we solve \\(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}=4\\). Our first step is to subtract the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) (the horizontal shift) to obtain \\(\\frac{1}{2}x=\\frac{5}{2}\\). Next, we multiply by \\(2\\) (the horizontal stretching) and obtain \\(x=5\\). We define two intermediate functions to handle first the shift, then the stretching. In accordance with Theorem 1.3, \\(m_{1}(x)=f\\left(x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=\\sqrt{x+\\frac{3}{2}}\\) will shift the graph of \\(f\\) to the left \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) units.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIf, on the other hand, we wish to graph \\(y=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)\\), we end up multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(2\\) which results in a horizontal scaling10 by a factor of \\(2\\), as demonstrated below.\nFootnote 10: Also called ‘horizontal stretching’, ‘horizontal expansion’ or ‘horizontal dilation’ by a factor of \\(2\\).\nWe have the following theorem.\n**Theorem 1.6**.: **Horizontal Scalings.** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function and \\(b>0\\). To graph \\(y=f(bx)\\), divide all of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(b\\). We say the graph of \\(f\\) has been horizontally scaled by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).\n* If \\(0<b<1\\), we say the graph of \\(f\\) has undergone a horizontal stretching (expansion, dilation) by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).\n* If \\(b>1\\), we say the graph of \\(f\\) has undergone a horizontal shrinking (compression, contraction) by a factor of \\(b\\).\nTheorem 1.6 tells us that if we multiply the input to a function by \\(b\\), the resulting graph is scaled horizontally by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) since the \\(x\\)-values are divided by \\(b\\) to produce corresponding points on the graph of \\(y=f(bx)\\). The next example explores how vertical and horizontal scalings sometimes interact with each other and with the other transformations introduced in this section.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|} \\hline \\(a\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x+\\pi=a\\) & \\(x\\) \\\\ \\hline\n0 & \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x+\\pi=0\\) & \\(-2\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x+\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) & \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x+\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) & \\(-1\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x+\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) & \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(\\pi\\) & \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x+\\pi=\\pi\\) & \\(0\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} We now use these \\(x\\)-values to generate our graph.\n\\begin{tabular}{|r||r|r|} \\hline \\(x\\) & \\(g(x)\\) & \\((x,g(x))\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-2\\) & undefined & \\\\ \\hline \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) & \\(3\\) & \\(\\left(-\\frac{3}{2},3\\right)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-1\\) & \\(1\\) & \\(\\left(-1,1\\right)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) & \\(-1\\) & \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2},-1\\right)\\) \\\\ \\hline \\(0\\) & undefined & \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} We find the period to be \\(0-(-2)=2\\).\nAs with the secant and cosecant functions, it is possible to extend the notion of period, phase shift and vertical shift to the tangent and cotangent functions as we did for the cosine and sine functions in Theorem 10.23. Since the number of classical applications involving sinusoids far outnumber those involving tangent and cotangent functions, we omit this. The ambitious reader is invited to formulate such a theorem, however.\n#### Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 12, graph one cycle of the given function. State the period, amplitude, phase shift and vertical shift of the function.\n1. \\(y=3\\sin(x)\\) 2. \\(y=\\sin(3x)\\) 3. \\(y=-2\\cos(x)\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. To graph \\(y=T(t)\\) using transformations, we start with the basic function, \\(f(t)=e^{t}\\). As we have already remarked, \\(e\\approx 2.718>1\\) so the graph of \\(f\\) is an increasing exponential with \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,1)\\) and horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\). The points \\(\\left(-1,e^{-1}\\right)\\approx(-1,0.37)\\) and \\((1,e)\\approx(1,2.72)\\) are also on the graph. Since the formula \\(T(t)\\) looks rather complicated, we rewrite \\(T(t)\\) in the form presented in Theorem 1.7 and use that result to track the changes to our three points and the horizontal asymptote. We have \\[T(t)=70+90e^{-0.1t}=90e^{-0.1t}+70=90f(-0.1t)+70\\] Multiplication of the input to \\(f\\), \\(t\\), by \\(-0.1\\) results in a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(10\\) as well as a reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. We divide each of the \\(x\\) values of our points by \\(-0.1\\) (which amounts to multiplying them by \\(-10\\)) to obtain \\(\\left(10,e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\), and \\((-10,e)\\). Since none of these changes affected the \\(y\\) values, the horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we see that the output from \\(f\\) is being multiplied by \\(90\\). This results in a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(90\\). We multiply the \\(y\\)-coordinates by \\(90\\) to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}\\right)\\), \\((0,90)\\), and \\((-10,90e)\\). We also multiply the \\(y\\) value of the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) by \\(90\\), and it remains \\(y=0\\). Finally, we add \\(70\\) to all of the \\(y\\)-coordinates, which shifts the graph upwards to obtain \\(\\left(10,90e^{-1}+70\\right)\\approx(10,103.11)\\), \\((0,160)\\), and \\((-10,90e+70)\\approx(-10,314.64)\\). Adding \\(70\\) to the horizontal asymptote shifts it upwards as well to \\(y=70\\). We connect these three points using the same shape in the same direction as in the graph of \\(f\\) and, last but not least, we restrict the domain to match the applied domain \\([0,\\infty)\\). The result is below.\n\n\n",

Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}x^{n},\\]\nwith the understanding that \\(a_{n}\\) may depend on \\(n\\) but not on \\(x\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 11.8.2**\\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{x^{n}\\over n}\\) is a power series. We can investigate convergence using the ratio test:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{|x|^{n+1}\\over n+1}{n\\over|x|^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|x|{n \\over n+1}=|x|.\\]\nThus when \\(|x|<1\\) the series converges and when \\(|x|>1\\) it diverges, leaving only two values in doubt. When \\(x=1\\) the series is the harmonic series and diverges; when \\(x=-1\\) it is the alternating harmonic series (actually the negative of the usual alternating harmonic series) and converges. Thus, we may think of \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{x^{n}\\over n}\\) as a function from the interval \\([-1,1)\\) to the real numbers. \\(\\Box\\)\nA bit of thought reveals that the ratio test applied to a power series will always have the same nice form. In general, we will compute\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{|a_{n+1}||x|^{n+1}\\over|a_{n}||x|^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|x|{ |a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}=|x|\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}=L|x|,\\]\nassuming that \\(\\lim|a_{n+1}|/|a_{n}|\\) exists. Then the series converges if \\(L|x|<1\\), that is, if \\(|x|<1/L\\), and diverges if \\(|x|>1/L\\). Only the two values \\(x=\\pm 1/L\\) require further\ninvestigation. Thus the series will definitely define a function on the interval \\((-1/L,1/L)\\), and perhaps will extend to one or both endpoints as well. Two special cases deserve mention: if \\(L=0\\) the limit is \\(0\\) no matter what value \\(x\\) takes, so the series converges for all \\(x\\) and the function is defined for all real numbers. If \\(L=\\infty\\), then for any non-zero value of \\(x\\) the limit is infinite, so the series converges only when \\(x=0\\). The value \\(1/L\\) is called the **radius of convergence** of the series, and the interval on which the series converges is the **interval of convergence**.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\nAgain we show that the sequence is decreasing, and since each term is positive the sequence converges. We can't take the derivative this time, as \\(x!\\) doesn't make sense for \\(x\\) real. But we note that if \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}<1\\) then \\(a_{n+1}<a_{n}\\), which is what we want to know. So we look at \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\):\n\\[{a_{n+1}\\over a_{n}}={(n+1)!\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}{n^{n}\\over n!}={(n+1)!\\over n!} {n^{n}\\over(n+1)^{n+1}}={n+1\\over n+1}\\left({n\\over n+1}\\right)^{n}=\\left({n \\over n+1}\\right)^{n}<1.\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. To solve \\(h(x)\\geq x\\), we proceed as before and collect all nonzero terms on one side of the inequality in order to use a sign diagram.\n\\[h(x) \\geq x\\] \\[\\frac{1000}{x^{2}} \\geq x\\] \\[\\frac{1000}{x^{2}}-x \\geq 0\\] \\[\\frac{1000-x^{3}}{x^{2}} \\geq 0\\quad\\text{common denominator}\\]\nWe consider the left hand side of the inequality as our rational function \\(r(x)\\). We see \\(r\\) is undefined at \\(x=0\\), but, as in the previous example, the applied domain of the problem is \\(x>0\\), so we are considering only the behavior of \\(r\\) on \\((0,\\infty)\\). The sole zero of \\(r\\) comes when \\(1000-x^{3}=0\\), which is \\(x=10\\). Choosing test values in the intervals \\((0,10)\\) and \\((10,\\infty)\\) gives the following diagram.\nWe see \\(r(x)>0\\) on \\((0,10)\\), and since \\(r(x)=0\\) at \\(x=10\\), our solution is \\((0,10]\\). In the context of the problem, \\(h\\) represents the height of the box while \\(x\\) represents the width (and depth) of the box. Solving \\(h(x)\\geq x\\) is tantamount to finding the values of \\(x\\) which result in a box where the height is at least as big as the width (and, in this case, depth.) Our answer tells us the width of the box can be at most 10 centimeters for this to happen.\n3. As \\(x\\to 0^{+}\\), \\(h(x)=\\frac{1000}{x^{2}}\\to\\infty\\). This means that the smaller the width \\(x\\) (and, in this case, depth), the larger the height \\(h\\) has to be in order to maintain a volume of 1000 cubic centimeters. As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), we find \\(h(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), which means that in order to maintain a volume of 1000 cubic centimeters, the width and depth must get bigger as the height becomes smaller.\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\). If we can find \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) so that \\(\\partial Q/\\partial x-\\partial P/\\partial y=1\\), then the area is also\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy.\\]\nIt is quite easy to do this: \\(P=0,Q=x\\) works, as do \\(P=-y,Q=0\\) and \\(P=-y/2,Q=x/2\\).\n##### Example 16.4.3\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 16.9 The Divergence Theorem\nThe third version of Green's Theorem (equation 16.5.2) we saw was:\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,ds=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}\\, dA.\\]\nWith minor changes this turns into another equation, the Divergence Theorem:\n#### Divergence Theorem\nUnder suitable conditions, if \\(E\\) is a region of three dimensional space and \\(D\\) is its boundary surface, oriented outward, then\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\iiint\\limits_{E}\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}\\, dV.\\]\nProof.: Again this theorem is too difficult to prove here, but a special case is easier. In the proof of a special case of Green's Theorem, we needed to know that we could describe the region of integration in both possible orders, so that we could set up one double integral using \\(dx\\,dy\\) and another using \\(dy\\,dx\\). Similarly here, we need to be able to describe the three-dimensional region \\(E\\) in different ways.\nWe start by rewriting the triple integral:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf F}\\,dV=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}(P _{x}+Q_{y}+R_{z})\\,dV=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}P_{x}\\,dV+\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int \\limits_{E}Q_{y}\\,dV+\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}R_{z}\\,dV.\\]\nThe double integral may be rewritten:\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\bf F}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D} (P{\\bf i}+Q{\\bf j}+R{\\bf k})\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}P{\\bf i }\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS+\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}Q{\\bf j}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS+\\int\\! \\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}R{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS.\\]\nTo prove that these give the same value it is sufficient to prove that\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}P{\\bf i}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}P_{x}\\,dV,\\] \\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}Q{\\bf j}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{y}\\,dV,\\;\\mbox{and}\\] (16.9.1) \\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}R{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf N}\\,dS =\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}R_{z}\\,dV.\\]\nNot surprisingly, these are all pretty much the same; we'll do the first one.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Theorem 11.5**.: **Law of Cosines:** Given a triangle with angle-side opposite pairs \\((\\alpha,a)\\), \\((\\beta,b)\\) and \\((\\gamma,c)\\), the following equations hold\n\\[a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\\cos(\\alpha)\\qquad b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2ac\\cos(\\beta) \\qquad c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\\cos(\\gamma)\\]\nor, solving for the cosine in each equation, we have\n\\[\\cos(\\alpha)=\\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2bc}\\qquad\\cos(\\beta)=\\frac{a^{2}+c^{2}- b^{2}}{2ac}\\qquad\\cos(\\gamma)=\\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab}\\]\nTo prove the theorem, we consider a generic triangle with the vertex of angle \\(\\alpha\\) at the origin with side \\(b\\) positioned along the positive \\(x\\)-axis.\nFrom this set-up, we immediately find that the coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are \\(A(0,0)\\) and \\(C(b,0)\\). From Theorem 10.3, we know that since the point \\(B(x,y)\\) lies on a circle of radius \\(c\\), the coordinates\nof \\(B\\) are \\(B(x,y)=B(c\\cos(\\alpha),c\\sin(\\alpha))\\). (This would be true even if \\(\\alpha\\) were an obtuse or right angle so although we have drawn the case when \\(\\alpha\\) is acute, the following computations hold for any angle \\(\\alpha\\) drawn in standard position where \\(0<\\alpha<180^{\\circ}\\).) We note that the distance between the points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) is none other than the length of side \\(a\\). Using the distance formula, Equation 1.1, we get\n\\[a = \\sqrt{(c\\cos(\\alpha)-b)^{2}+(c\\sin(\\alpha)-0)^{2}}\\] \\[a^{2} = \\left(\\sqrt{(c\\cos(\\alpha)-b)^{2}+c^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\alpha)}\\right)^ {2}\\] \\[a^{2} = (c\\cos(\\alpha)-b)^{2}+c^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\alpha)\\] \\[a^{2} = c^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\alpha)-2bc\\cos(\\alpha)+b^{2}+c^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\alpha)\\] \\[a^{2} = c^{2}\\left(\\cos^{2}(\\alpha)+\\sin^{2}(\\alpha)\\right)+b^{2}-2bc \\cos(\\alpha)\\] \\[a^{2} = c^{2}(1)+b^{2}-2bc\\cos(\\alpha)\\] Since \\[\\cos^{2}(\\alpha)+\\sin^{2}(\\alpha)=1\\] \\[a^{2} = c^{2}+b^{2}-2bc\\cos(\\alpha)\\]\nThe remaining formulas given in Theorem 11.5 can be shown by simply reorienting the triangle to place a different vertex at the origin. We leave these details to the reader. What's important about \\(a\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) in the above proof is that \\((\\alpha,a)\\) is an angle-side opposite pair and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are the sides adjacent to \\(\\alpha\\) - the same can be said of any other angle-side opposite pair in the triangle. Notice that the proof of the Law of Cosines relies on the distance formula which has its roots in the Pythagorean Theorem. That being said, the Law of Cosines can be thought of as a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem. If we have a triangle in which \\(\\gamma=90^{\\circ}\\), then \\(\\cos(\\gamma)=\\cos\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=0\\) so we get the familiar relationship \\(c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}\\). What this means is that in the larger mathematical sense, the Law of Cosines and the Pythagorean Theorem amount to pretty much the same thing.2\n\nDocument 5:\n----\ndetermined using the equation \\(\\gamma=180^{\\circ}-\\alpha-\\beta\\). Knowing the measures of all three angles of a triangle completely determines its _shape_. If in addition we are given the length of one of the sides of the triangle, we can then use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of the remaining two sides to determine the _size_ of the triangle. Such is the case in numbers 1 and 2 above. In number 1, the given side is adjacent to just one of the angles - this is called the 'Angle-Angle-Side' (AAS) case.8 In number 2, the given side is adjacent to both angles which means we are in the so-called 'Angle-Side-Angle' (ASA) case. If, on the other hand, we are given the measure of just one of the angles in the triangle along with the length of two sides, only one of which is adjacent to the given angle, we are in the 'Angle-Side-Side' (ASS) case.9 In number 3, the length of the one given side \\(a\\) was too short to even form a triangle; in number 4, the length of \\(a\\) was just long enough to form a right triangle; in 5, \\(a\\) was long enough, but not too long, so that two triangles were possible; and in number 6, side \\(a\\) was long enough to form a triangle but too long to swing back and form two. These four cases exemplify all of the possibilities in the Angle-Side-Side case which are summarized in the following theorem.\nFootnote 8: If this sounds familiar, it should. From high school Geometry, we know there are four congruence conditions for triangles: Angle-Angle-Side (AAS), Angle-Side-Angle (ASA), Side-Angle-Side (SAS) and Side-Side-Side (SSS). If we are given information about a triangle that meets one of these four criteria, then we are guaranteed that exactly one triangle exists which satisfies the given criteria.\nFootnote 9: In more reputable books, this is called the ‘Side-Side-Angle’ or SSA case.\n**Theorem 11.3**.: Suppose \\((\\alpha,a)\\) and \\((\\gamma,c)\\) are intended to be angle-side pairs in a triangle where \\(\\alpha\\), \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are given. Let \\(h=c\\sin(\\alpha)\\)\n* If \\(a<h\\), then no triangle exists which satisfies the given criteria.\n* If \\(a=h\\), then \\(\\gamma=90^{\\circ}\\) so exactly one (right) triangle exists which satisfies the criteria.\n\n\n",

Now that we have painstakingly determined the domain of \\(F(t)=\\sec(t)\\), it is time to discuss the range. Once again, we appeal to the definition \\(F(t)=\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}\\). The range of \\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\), and since \\(F(t)=\\sec(t)\\) is undefined when \\(\\cos(t)=0\\), we split our discussion into two cases: when \\(0<\\cos(t)\\leq 1\\) and when \\(-1\\leq\\cos(t)<0\\). If \\(0<\\cos(t)\\leq 1\\), then we can divide the inequality \\(\\cos(t)\\leq 1\\) by \\(\\cos(t)\\) to obtain \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}\\geq 1\\). Moreover, using the notation introduced in Section 4.2, we have that as \\(\\cos(t)\\to 0^{+}\\), \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}\\approx\\frac{1}{\\mbox{\\tiny{very small }}(+)}\\approx\\) very big \\((+)\\). In other words, as \\(\\cos(t)\\to 0^{+},\\sec(t)\\to\\infty\\). If, on the other hand, if \\(-1\\leq\\cos(t)<0\\), then dividing by \\(\\cos(t)\\) causes a reversal of the inequality so that \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\sec(t)}\\leq-1\\). In this case, as \\(\\cos(t)\\to 0^{-}\\), \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}\\approx\\frac{1}{\\mbox{\\tiny{very small }}(-)}\\approx\\) very big \\((-)\\), so that as \\(\\cos(t)\\to 0^{-}\\), we get \\(\\sec(t)\\to-\\infty\\). Since\n\\(f(t)=\\cos(t)\\) admits all of the values in \\([-1,1]\\), the function \\(F(t)=\\sec(t)\\) admits all of the values in \\((-\\infty,-1]\\cup[1,\\infty)\\). Using set-builder notation, the range of \\(F(t)=\\sec(t)\\) can be written as \\(\\left\\{u\\,:\\,u\\leq-1\\text{ or }u\\geq 1\\right\\}\\), or, more succinctly,8 as \\(\\left\\{u:\\left|u\\right|\\geq 1\\right\\}\\).9 Similar arguments can be used to determine the domains and ranges of the remaining three circular functions: \\(\\csc(t)\\), \\(\\tan(t)\\) and \\(\\cot(t)\\). The reader is encouraged to do so. (See the Exercises.) For now, we gather these facts into the theorem below.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nIf all of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the terms \\(a_{n}\\) approach zero, but this does not mean that \\(a_{n}\\geq a_{n+1}\\) for every \\(n\\). Many useful and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to understand. Let's look at an example.\n##### Example 11.3.1\nShow that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges.\nThe terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) are positive and decreasing, and since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1/x^{2}=0\\), the terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number \\(N\\) so that \\(s_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\). The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is inherent in figure 11.\nThe figure shows the graph of \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\n\n",

Find all of the complex zeros of \\(f\\) and state their multiplicities.\n2. Factor \\(f(x)\\) using Theorem 3.14\n**Solution.**\n1. Since \\(f\\) is a fifth degree polynomial, we know that we need to perform at least three successful divisions to get the quotient down to a quadratic function. At that point, we can find the remaining zeros using the Quadratic Formula, if necessary. Using the techniques developed in Section 3.3, we get\n\\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrrrrr}\\frac{1}{2}&12&-20&19&-6&-2&1\\\\ &\\downarrow&6&-7&6&0&-1\\\\ \\hline 12&-14&12&0&-2&0\\\\ \\downarrow&6&-4&4&2\\\\ \\hline 12&-8&8&4&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4&4&-4\\\\ \\hline 12&-12&12&0\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nOur quotient is \\(12x^{2}-12x+12\\), whose zeros we find to be \\(\\frac{1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). From Theorem 3.14, we know \\(f\\) has exactly \\(5\\) zeros, counting multiplicities, and as such we have the zero \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) with multiplicity \\(2\\), and the zeros \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), each of multiplicity \\(1\\).\n2. Applying Theorem 3.14, we are guaranteed that \\(f\\) factors as \\[f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left[ \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\left(x-\\left[\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\]\nA true test of Theorem 3.14 (and a student's mettle!) would be to take the factored form of \\(f(x)\\) in the previous example and multiply it out9 to see that it really does reduce to the original formula \\(f(x)=12x^{5}-20x^{4}+19x^{3}-6x^{2}-2x+1\\). When factoring a polynomial using Theorem 3.14, we say that it is **factored completely over the complex numbers**, meaning that it is impossible to factor the polynomial any further using complex numbers. If we wanted to completely factor \\(f(x)\\) over the **real numbers** then we would have stopped short of finding the nonreal zeros of \\(f\\) and factored \\(f\\) using our work from the synthetic division to write \\(f(x)=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(12x^{2}-12 x+12\\right)\\), or \\(f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)\\). Since the zeros of \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) are nonreal, we call \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) an **irreducible quadratic** meaning it is impossible to break it down any further using _real_ numbers. Footnote 9: You really should do this once in your life to convince yourself that all of the theory actually does work!\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nAlternatively, we can use what we know about end behavior of polynomials to help us understand this theorem. From Theorem 3.2, we know the end behavior of a polynomial is determined by its leading term. Applying this to the numerator and denominator of \\(f(x)\\), we get that as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), \\(f(x)=\\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\approx\\frac{2x}{x}=2\\). This last approach is useful in Calculus, and, indeed, is made rigorous there. (Keep this in mind for the remainder of this paragraph.) Applying this reasoning to the general case, suppose \\(r(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) where \\(a\\) is the leading coefficient of \\(p(x)\\) and \\(b\\) is the leading coefficient of \\(q(x)\\). As \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), \\(r(x)\\approx\\frac{ax^{n}}{bx^{m}}\\), where \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are the degrees of \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\), respectively. If the degree of \\(p(x)\\) and the degree of \\(q(x)\\) are the same, then \\(n=m\\) so that \\(r(x)\\approx\\frac{a}{b}\\), which means \\(y=\\frac{a}{b}\\) is the horizontal asymptote in this case. If the degree of \\(p(x)\\) is less than the degree of \\(q(x)\\), then \\(n<m\\), so \\(m-n\\) is a positive number, and hence, \\(r(x)\\approx\\frac{a}{bx^{m-n}}\\to 0\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). If the degree of \\(p(x)\\) is greater than the degree of \\(q(x)\\), then \\(n>m\\), and hence \\(n-m\\) is a positive number and \\(r(x)\\approx\\frac{ax^{n-m}}{b}\\), which becomes unbounded as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). As we said before, if a rational function has a horizontal asymptote, then it will have only one. (This is not true for other types of functions we shall see in later chapters.)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThis presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also need to approximate \\(e^{2}\\), and any approximation we use will increase the error, but we will not pursue this complication. \\(\\sqcap\\)\nNote well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on a small interval, even though the series for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\) converge for all \\(x\\); this is typical.

Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant\n\\[\\left|\\matrix{f_{u}&g_{u}\\cr f_{v}&g_{v}\\cr}\\right|,\\]\nwhich may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThe notation \\(f^{-1}\\) is an unfortunate choice since you've been programmed since Elementary Algebra to think of this as \\(\\frac{1}{f}\\). This is most definitely _not_ the case since, for instance, \\(f(x)=3x+4\\) has as its inverse \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x-4}{3}\\), which is certainly different than \\(\\frac{1}{f(x)}=\\frac{1}{3x+4}\\). Why does this confusing notation persist? As we mentioned in Section 5.1, the identity function \\(I\\) is to function composition what the real number \\(1\\) is to real number multiplication. The choice of notation \\(f^{-1}\\) alludes to the property that \\(f^{-1}\\circ f=I_{1}\\) and \\(f\\circ f^{-1}=I_{2}\\), in much the same way as \\(3^{-1}\\cdot 3=1\\) and \\(3\\cdot 3^{-1}=1\\).\nLet's turn our attention to the function \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). Is \\(f\\) invertible? A likely candidate for the inverse is the function \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Checking the composition yields \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}}=|x|\\), which is not equal to \\(x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\). For example, when \\(x=-2\\), \\(f(-2)=(-2)^{2}=4\\), but \\(g(4)=\\sqrt{4}=2\\), which means \\(g\\) failed to return the input \\(-2\\) from its output \\(4\\). What \\(g\\) did, however, is match the output \\(4\\) to a _different_ input, namely \\(2\\), which satisfies \\(f(2)=4\\). This issue is presented schematically in the picture below.\nWe see from the diagram that since both \\(f(-2)\\) and \\(f(2)\\) are \\(4\\), it is impossible to construct a _function_ which takes \\(4\\) back to _both_\\(x=2\\) and \\(x=-2\\). (By definition, a function matches a real number with exactly one other real number.) From a graphical standpoint, we know that if\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nSolution:\n1. Since both equations contain \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(y^{2}\\) only, we can eliminate one of the variables as we did in Section 8.1. \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}(E1)&x^{2}+y^{2}&=&4\\\\ (E2)&4x^{2}+9y^{2}&=&36\\end{array}\\right.\\stackrel{{\\text{Replace $E2$ with}}}{{-4E1\\,+ $E2$}}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}(E1)&x^{2}+y^{2}&=&4\\\\ (E2)&5y^{2}&=&20\\end{array}\\right.\\] From \\(5y^{2}=20\\), we get \\(y^{2}=4\\) or \\(y=\\pm 2\\). To find the associated \\(x\\) values, we substitute each value of \\(y\\) into one of the equations to find the resulting value of \\(x\\). Choosing \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\), we find that for both \\(y=-2\\) and \\(y=2\\), we get \\(x=0\\). Our solution is thus \\(\\{(0,2),(0,-2)\\}\\). To check this algebraically, we need to show that both points satisfy both of the original equations. We leave it to the reader to verify this. To check our answer graphically, we sketch both equations and look for their points of intersection. The graph of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\) is a circle centered at \\((0,0)\\) with a radius of \\(2\\), whereas the graph of \\(4x^{2}+9y^{2}=36\\), when written in the standard form \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{9}+\\frac{y^{2}}{4}=1\\) is easily recognized as an ellipse centered at \\((0,0)\\) with a major axis along the \\(x\\)-axis of length \\(6\\) and a minor axis along the \\(y\\)-axis of length \\(4\\). We see from the graph that the two curves intersect at their \\(y\\)-intercepts only, \\((0,\\pm 2)\\).\n2. We proceed as before to eliminate one of the variables \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}(E1)&x^{2}+y^{2}&=&4\\\\ (E2)&4x^{2}-9y^{2}&=&36\\end{array}\\right.\\stackrel{{\\text{Replace $E2$ with}}}{{-4E1\\,+ $E2$}}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}(E1)&x^{2}+y^{2}&=&4\\\\ (E2)&-13y^{2}&=&20\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nso \\(G(y)=F(t)+C\\). Now we solve this equation for \\(y\\).\n### First Order Differential Equations\nOf course, there are a few places this ideal description could go wrong: we need to be able to find the antiderivatives \\(G\\) and \\(F\\), and we need to solve the final equation for \\(y\\). The upshot is that the solutions to the original differential equation are the constant solutions, if any, and all functions \\(y\\) that satisfy \\(G(y)=F(t)+C\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.1.9** Consider the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=ky\\). When \\(k>0\\), this describes certain simple cases of population growth: it says that the change in the population \\(y\\) is proportional to the population. The underlying assumption is that each organism in the current population reproduces at a fixed rate, so the larger the population the more new organisms are produced. While this is too simple to model most real populations, it is useful in some cases over a limited time. When \\(k<0\\), the differential equation describes a quantity that decreases in proportion to the current value; this can be used to model radioactive decay.\nThe constant solution is \\(y(t)=0\\); of course this will not be the solution to any interesting initial value problem. For the non-constant solutions, we proceed much as before:\n\n\n",

If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

This means as time goes by, only a total of 500 students will have ever had the flu.\nWe close this section with a discussion of the _third_ (and final!) kind of asymptote which can be associated with the graphs of rational functions. Let us return to the function \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-4}{x+1}\\) in Example 4.1.4. Performing long division,12 we get \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-4}{x+1}=x-1-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\). Since the term \\(\\frac{3}{x+1}\\to 0\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), it stands to reason that as \\(x\\) becomes unbounded, the function values \\(g(x)=x-1-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\approx x-1\\). Geometrically, this means that the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) should resemble the line \\(y=x-1\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). We see this play out both numerically and graphically below.\nFootnote 12: See the remarks following Theorem 4.2.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline x&g(x)&x-1\\\\ \\hline-10&\\approx-10.6667&-11\\\\ \\hline-100&\\approx-100.9697&-101\\\\ \\hline-1000&\\approx-1000.9970&-1001\\\\ \\hline-10000&\\approx-10000.9997&-10001\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline x&g(x)&x-1\\\\ \\hline 10&\\approx 8.7273&9\\\\ \\hline 100&\\approx 98.9703&99\\\\ \\hline 1000&\\approx 998.9970&999\\\\ \\hline 10000&\\approx 9998.9997&9999\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline y=g(x)&\\text{and }y=x-1\\\\ \\text{as }x\\to-\\infty&\\text{as }x\\to\\infty\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nThe way we symbolize the relationship between the end behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) with that of the line \\(y=x-1\\) is to write 'as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), \\(g(x)\\to x-1\\).' In this case, we say the line \\(y=x-1\\) is a **slant asymptote**13 to the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). Informally, the graph of a rational function has a slant asymptote if, as \\(x\\to\\infty\\) or as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph resembles a non-horizontal, or 'slanted' line. Formally, we define a slant asymptote as follows.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. To find the \\(x\\)-intercept we set \\(y=g(x)=0\\). Using the factored form of \\(g(x)\\) above, we find the zeros to be the solutions of \\((2x-5)(x+1)=0\\). We obtain \\(x=\\frac{5}{2}\\) and \\(x=-1\\). Since both of these numbers are in the domain of \\(g\\), we have two \\(x\\)-intercepts, \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, we set \\(x=0\\) and find \\(y=g(0)=\\frac{5}{6}\\), so our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\).\n4. Since \\(g(x)\\) was given to us in lowest terms, we have, once again by Theorem 4.1 vertical asymptotes \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=3\\). Keeping in mind \\(g(x)=\\frac{(2x-5)(x+1)}{(x-3)(x+2)}\\), we proceed to our analysis near each of these values. * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(-9)(-1)}{(-5)(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\]\nso as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). On the flip side, as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to 3\\):_ As \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number just shy of \\(3\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(1)(4)}{(\\text{ very small }(-))(5)}\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{ very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] Hence, as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, we have (again, without labels on the \\(y\\)-axis) 5. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator of \\(g(x)\\) are the same, we know from Theorem 4.2 that we can find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of \\(g\\) by taking the ratio of the leading terms coefficients, \\(y=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\).

Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nHere we have replaced \\(a\\) by \\(t\\) in the first \\(N+1\\) terms of the Taylor series, and added a carefully chosen term on the end, with \\(B\\) to be determined. Note that we are temporarily keeping \\(x\\) fixed, so the only variable in this equation is \\(t\\), and we will be interested only in \\(t\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(x\\). Now substitute \\(t=a\\):\n\\[F(a)=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\,(x-a)^{n}+B(x-a)^{N+1}.\\]\nSet this equal to \\(f(x)\\):\n\\[f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}\\,(x-a)^{n}+B(x-a)^{N+1}.\\]\nSince \\(x\\neq a\\), we can solve this for \\(B\\), which is a \"constant\"--it depends on \\(x\\) and \\(a\\) but those are temporarily fixed. Now we have defined a function \\(F(t)\\) with the property that \\(F(a)=f(x)\\). Consider also \\(F(x)\\): all terms with a positive power of \\((x-t)\\) become zero when we substitute \\(x\\) for \\(t\\), so we are left with \\(F(x)=f^{(0)}(x)/0!=f(x)\\). So \\(F(t)\\) is a function with the same value on the endpoints of the interval \\([a,x]\\). By Rolle's theorem (6.5.1), we know that there is a value \\(z\\in(a,x)\\) such that \\(F^{\\prime}(z)=0\\). Let's look at \\(F^{\\prime}(t)\\). Each term in \\(F(t)\\), except the first term and the extra term involving \\(B\\), is a product, so to take the derivative we use the product rule on each of these terms. It will help to write out the first few terms of the definition:\n\\[F(t)=f(t) +\\frac{f^{(1)}(t)}{1!}(x-t)^{1}+\\frac{f^{(2)}(t)}{2!}(x-t)^{2}+ \\frac{f^{(3)}(t)}{3!}(x-t)^{3}+\\cdots\\] \\[+\\frac{f^{(N)}(t)}{N!}(x-t)^{N}+B(x-t)^{N+1}.\\]\n### Chapter 11 Sequences and Series\nNow take the derivative:\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNext, we check \\(g\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)=x\\) for all \\(x\\) in the range of \\(g\\). From the graph of \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1, we have that the range of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,-2)\\cup(-2,\\infty)\\). This matches the domain we get from the formula \\(g^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x}{x+2}\\), as it should.\n\\[\\left(g\\circ g^{-1}\\right)(x) = g\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)\\] \\[= g\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)}{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)}{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)} \\cdot\\frac{(x+2)}{(x+2)}\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{clear denominators}\\] \\[= \\frac{2x}{(x+2)-x}\\] \\[= \\frac{2x}{2}\\] \\[= x\\ \\check{\\ }\\check{}\\]\nGraphing \\(y=g(x)\\) and \\(y=g^{-1}(x)\\) on the same set of axes is busy, but we can see the symmetric relationship if we thicken the curve for \\(y=g^{-1}(x)\\). Note that the vertical asymptote \\(x=1\\) of the graph of \\(g\\) corresponds to the horizontal asymptote \\(y=1\\) of the graph of \\(g^{-1}\\), as it should since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are switched. Similarly, the horizontal asymptote \\(y=-2\\) of the graph of \\(g\\) corresponds to the vertical asymptote \\(x=-2\\) of the graph of \\(g^{-1}\\).\nWe now return to \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\).

The relation \\(R\\) consists of all points \\((x,y)\\) whose \\(y\\)-coordinate is greater than \\(|x|\\). If we graph \\(y=|x|\\), then we want all of the points in the plane _above_ the points on the graph. Dotting the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) as we have done before to indicate that the points on the graph itself are not in the relation, we get the shaded region below on the left.\n2. For a point to be in \\(S\\), its \\(y\\)-coordinate must be less than or equal to the \\(y\\)-coordinate on the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). This is the set of all points _below_ or _on_ the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n3. Finally, the relation \\(T\\) takes the points whose \\(y\\)-coordinates satisfy both the conditions given in \\(R\\) and those of \\(S\\). Thus we shade the region between \\(y=|x|\\) and \\(y=2-x^{2}\\), keeping those points on the parabola, but not the points on \\(y=|x|\\). To get an accurate graph, we need to find where these two graphs intersect, so we set \\(|x|=2-x^{2}\\). Proceeding as before, breaking this equation into cases, we get \\(x=-1,1\\).

The curve \\(y^{2}-x-4=0\\) describes a parabola since exactly one of the variables is squared. Rewriting this in standard form, we get \\(y^{2}=x+4\\) and we see that the vertex is \\((-4,0)\\) and the parabola opens to the right. Using the test points \\((-5,0)\\) and \\((0,0)\\), we find that the solution to the inequality includes the region to the right of, or 'inside', the parabola. The points on the parabola itself are also part of the solution, since the vertex \\((-4,0)\\) satisfies the inequality. We now turn our attention to \\(x<y+2\\). Proceeding as before, we write \\(x-y-2<0\\) and focus our attention on \\(x-y-2=0\\), which is the line \\(y=x-2\\). Using the test points \\((0,0)\\) and \\((0,-4)\\), we find points in the region above the line \\(y=x-2\\) satisfy the inequality. The points on the line \\(y=x-2\\) do not satisfy the inequality, since the \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,-2)\\) does not. We see that these two regions do overlap, and to make the graph more precise, we seek the intersection of these two curves. That is, we need to solve the system of nonlinear equations \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&y^{2}&=&x+4\\\\ (E2)&y&=&x-2\\end{array}\\right.\\] Solving \\(E1\\) for \\(x\\), we get \\(x=y^{2}-4\\). Substituting this into \\(E2\\) gives \\(y=y^{2}-4-2\\), or \\(y^{2}-y-6=0\\). We find \\(y=-2\\) and \\(y=3\\) and since \\(x=y^{2}-4\\), we get that the graphs intersect at \\((0,-2)\\) and \\((5,3)\\). Putting all of this together, we get our final answer below. \\[\\xy\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe have so far integrated \"over\" intervals, areas, and volumes with single, double, and triple integrals. We now investigate integration over or \"along\" a curve--\"line integrals\" are really \"curve integrals\".\nAs with other integrals, a geometric example may be easiest to understand. Consider the function \\(f=x+y\\) and the parabola \\(y=x^{2}\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, for \\(0\\leq x\\leq 2\\). Imagine that we extend the parabola up to the surface \\(f\\), to form a curved wall or curtain, as in figure 16.2.1. What is the area of the surface thus formed? We already know one way to compute surface area, but here we take a different approach that is more useful for the problems to come.\nAs usual, we start by thinking about how to approximate the area. We pick some points along the part of the parabola we're interested in, and connect adjacent points by straight lines; when the points are close together, the length of each line segment will be close to the length along the parabola. Using each line segment as the base of a rectangle, we choose the height to be the height of the surface \\(f\\) above the line segment. If we add up the areas of these rectangles, we get an approximation to the desired area, and in the limit this sum turns into an integral.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))\\,dt+\\int_{b}^{a}P(t,g_{2 }(t))\\,dt =\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))\\,dt-\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{2}(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{a}^{b}P(t,g_{1}(t))-P(t,g_{2}(t))\\,dt\\]\nwhich is the result of the double integral times \\(-1\\), as desired.\nThe equation involving \\(Q\\) is essentially the same, and left as an exercise.\nExercises 16.4.\n1.

Still, it is valuable to be able to visualize relatively simple surfaces without such aids. As in the previous example, it is often a good idea to examine the function on restricted subsets of the plane, especially lines. It can also be useful to identify those points \\((x,y)\\) that share a common \\(z\\)-value.\n**EXAMPLE 14.1.4** Consider \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\). When \\(x=0\\) this becomes \\(f=y^{2}\\), a parabola in the \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) plane; when \\(y=0\\) we get the \"same\" parabola \\(f=x^{2}\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) plane. Now consider the line \\(y=kx\\). If we simply replace \\(y\\) by \\(kx\\) we get \\(f(x,y)=(1+k^{2})x^{2}\\) which is a parabola, but it does not really \"represent\" the cross-section along \\(y=kx\\), because the cross-section has the line \\(y=kx\\) where the horizontal axis should be. In\norder to pretend that this line is the horizontal axis, we need to write the function in terms of the distance from the origin, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\\sqrt{x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}}\\). Now \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}=(\\sqrt{x^{2}+k^{2}x^{2}})^{2}\\). So the cross-section is the \"same\" parabola as in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) and \\(y\\)-\\(z\\) planes, namely, the height is always the distance from the origin squared. This means that \\(f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) can be formed by starting with \\(z=x^{2}\\) and rotating this curve around the \\(z\\) axis.\n\n\n",

To solve this nonlinear inequality, we follow the same guidelines set forth in Section 2.4: we get \\(0\\) on one side of the inequality and construct a sign diagram. Our original inequality can be rewritten as \\(2x^{5}-3x^{4}+6x^{3}-8x^{2}+3\\leq 0\\).

Find \\(\\lfloor 0.785\\rfloor\\), \\(\\lfloor 117\\rfloor\\), \\(\\lfloor-2.001\\rfloor\\), and \\(\\lfloor\\pi+6\\rfloor\\) 2. Discuss with your classmates how \\(\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\) may be described as a piecewise defined function. **HINT:** There are infinitely many pieces! 3. Is \\(\\lfloor a+b\\rfloor=\\lfloor a\\rfloor+\\lfloor b\\rfloor\\) always true? What if \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is an integer? Test some values, make a conjecture, and explain your result. Footnote 14: The use of the letter \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) for the integers is ostensibly because the German word _zahlen_ means ‘to count.’\n76. We have through our examples tried to convince you that, in general, \\(f(a+b)\\neq f(a)+f(b)\\). It has been our experience that students refuse to believe us so we'll try again with a different approach. With the help of your classmates, find a function \\(f\\) for which the following properties are always true. 1. \\(f(0)=f(-1+1)=f(-1)+f(1)\\)\n2. \\(f(5)=f(2+3)=f(2)+f(3)\\) 3. \\(f(-6)=f(0-6)=f(0)-f(6)\\) 4. \\(f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)\\) regardless of what two numbers we give you for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). How many functions did you find that failed to satisfy the conditions above? Did \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) work? What about \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) or \\(f(x)=3x+7\\) or \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{x}\\)? Did you find an attribute common to those functions that did succeed? You should have, because there is only one extremely special family of functions that actually works here. Thus we return to our previous statement, **in general**, \\(f(a+b)\\neq f(a)+f(b)\\).\n#### 1.4 Function Notation\n\n\n",

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n3. Since there are no like terms among the two equations, elimination won't do us any good. We turn to substitution and from the equation \\(y-2x=0\\), we get \\(y=2x\\). Substituting this into \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\) gives \\(x^{2}+(2x)^{2}=4\\). Solving, we find \\(5x^{2}=4\\) or \\(x=\\pm\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\). Returning to the equation we used for the substitution, \\(y=2x\\), we find \\(y=\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\) when \\(x=\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\), so one solution is \\(\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5},\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)\\). Similarly, we find the other solution to be \\(\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5},-\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)\\). We leave it to the reader that both points satisfy both equations, so that our final answer is \\(\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5},\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right),\\left(-\\frac{2 \\sqrt{5}}{5},-\\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)\\right\\}\\). The graph of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\) is our circle from before and the graph of \\(y-2x=0\\) is a line through the origin with slope \\(2\\). Though we cannot verify the numerical values of the points of intersection from our sketch, we do see that we have two solutions: one in Quadrant I and one in Quadrant III as required.\n4. While it may be tempting to solve \\(y-x^{2}=0\\) as \\(y=x^{2}\\) and substitute, we note that this system is set up for elimination.1 Footnote 1: We encourage the reader to solve the system using substitution to see that you get the same solution. \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&x^{2}+y^{2}&=&4\\\\ (E2)&y-x^{2}&=&0\\end{array}\\right.\\quad\\frac{\\text{Replace }E2\\text{ with}}{E1+E2}\\;\\;\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&x^{2}+y^{2}&=&4\\\\ (E2)&y^{2}+y&=&4\\end{array}\\right.\\] From \\(y^{2}+y=4\\) we get \\(y^{2}+y-4=0\\) which gives \\(y=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{17}}{2}\\). Due to the complicated nature of these answers, it is worth our time to make a quick sketch of both equations to head off any extraneous solutions we may encounter. We see that the circle \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\) intersects the parabola \\(y=x^{2}\\) exactly twice, and both of these points have a positive \\(y\\) value. Of the two solutions for \\(y\\), only \\(y=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{17}}{2}\\) is positive, so to get our solution, we substitute this\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n1. 1. We know \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\\) is the real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\tan(t)=\\sqrt{3}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), so \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The real number \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})\\) lies in the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\sqrt{3}\\). We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\). 3. We can apply Theorem 10.27 directly and obtain \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=-5\\). However, working it through provides us with yet another opportunity to understand why this is the case. Letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-5)\\), we have that \\(t\\) belongs to the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). 4. We start simplifying \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)\\) by letting \\(t=\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\). Then \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\) for some \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Since \\(\\tan(t)<0\\), we know, in fact, \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\). One way to proceed is to use The Pythagorean Identity, \\(1+\\operatorname{cot}^{2}(t)=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\), since this relates the reciprocals of \\(\\tan(t)\\) and \\(\\sin(t)\\) and is valid for all \\(t\\) under consideration.4 From \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\), we get \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\frac{4}{3}\\). Substituting, we get \\(1+\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2}=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\) so that \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=\\pm\\frac{5}{3}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\), we choose \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), so \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). 2. 1. If we let \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\), then \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\tan(t)=x\\). We look for a way to express \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Before we get started using identities, we note that \\(\\tan(2t)\\) is undefined when \\(2t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 tells us we need to exclude values of \\(t\\) where \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. The only members of this family which lie in \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) are \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), which means the values of \\(t\\) under consideration are \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\cup\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{ 4}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Returning to \\(\\arctan(2t)\\), we note the double angle identity \\(\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}\\), is valid for all the values of \\(t\\) under consideration, hence we get \\[\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant.

The general solution of the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Be^{-2t}\\). We guess that a solution to the non-homogeneous equation might look like \\(f(t)\\) itself, namely, a quadratic \\(y=at^{2}+bt+c\\)\n\n\n",

To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\).

In the small village of Pedimaxus in the country of Sasquatchia, all 150 residents get one of the two local newspapers. Market research has shown that in any given week, 90% of those who subscribe to the Pedimaxus Tribune want to keep getting it, but 10% want to switch to the Sasquatchia Picayune. Of those who receive the Picayune, 80% want to continue with it and 20% want switch to the Tribune. We can express this situation using matrices. Specifically, let \\(X\\) be the 'state matrix' given by\n\\[X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}T\\\\ P\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of people who get the Tribune and \\(P\\) is the number of people who get the Picayune in a given week.

Let's assume that when Pedimaxus was founded, all 150 residents got the Tribune. (Let's call this Week 0.) This would mean \\[X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}150\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\] Since 10% of that 150 want to switch to the Picayune, we should have that for Week 1, 135 people get the Tribune and 15 people get the Picayune.

We choose the latter to obtain \\(F(t)=0.475\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{15}t-2\\pi\\right)+0.505=0.475\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{ 15}t\\right)+0.505\\)\n* 2. Our function and the data set are graphed below. It's a pretty good fit. 3. The fraction of the moon illuminated on June 1st, 2009 is approximately \\(F(1)\\approx 0.60\\) 4. Using a graphing calculator, we get the following. This model predicts that the fraction of the moon illuminated on June 1st, 2009 is approximately \\(0.59\\). This appears to be a better fit to the data than our first model.\n### The Law of Sines\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{{1\\over 12}(2){1\\over n^{2}}&<0.001\\cr{1\\over 6}(1000)&<n^{2}\\cr 12.91 \\approx\\sqrt{500\\over 3}&<n\\cr}\\]\nHad we immediately tried \\(n=13\\) this would have given us the desired answer. \\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\nThe trapezoid approximation works well, especially compared to rectangles, because the tops of the trapezoids form a reasonably good approximation to the curve when \\(\\Delta x\\) is fairly small. We can extend this idea: what if we try to approximate the curve more closely,\nby using something other than a straight line? The obvious candidate is a parabola: if we can approximate a short piece of the curve with a parabola with equation \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), we can easily compute the area under the parabola.\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThis is usually known as the **Trapezoid Rule**. For a modest number of subintervals this is not too difficult to do with a calculator; a computer can easily do many subintervals.\n**Figure 8.6.2** A single trapezoid.\nIn practice, an approximation is useful only if we know how accurate it is; for example, we might need a particular value accurate to three decimal places. When we compute a particular approximation to an integral, the error is the difference between the approximation and the true value of the integral. For any approximation technique, we need an **error estimate**, a value that is guaranteed to be larger than the actual error. If \\(A\\) is an approximation and \\(E\\) is the associated error estimate, then we know that the true value of the integral is between \\(A-E\\) and \\(A+E\\). In the case of our approximation of the integral, we want \\(E=E(\\Delta x)\\) to be a function of \\(\\Delta x\\) that gets small rapidly as \\(\\Delta x\\) gets small. Fortunately, for many functions, there is such an error estimate associated with the trapezoid approximation.\n**THEOREM 8.6.1** Suppose \\(f\\) has a second derivative \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for the trapezoid approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)={{b-a}\\over 12}M(\\Delta x)^{2}={{(b-a)^{3}}\\over 12n^{2}}M.\\]\nLet's see how we can use this.\n\n\n",

But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\nFigure 6.4.1: The linear approximation to \\(y=x^{2}\\).\nfunctions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.\n##### Example 6.4.2\nConsider the trigonometric function \\(\\sin x\\). Its linear approximation at \\(x=0\\) is simply \\(L(x)=x\\). When \\(x\\) is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists to simplify some calculations.\n##### Definition 6.4.3\nLet \\(y=f(x)\\) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable \\(dx\\), and a new dependent variable \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\). Notice that \\(dy\\) is a function both of \\(x\\) (since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is a function of \\(x\\)) and of \\(dx\\). We say that \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are **differentials**.\n_Remark._ Up until now, \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) made sense only together, as \\(dy/dx\\), another way to write \\(f^{\\prime}\\). Now we have given them have individual meanings, but notice that since \\(dy=f^{\\prime}(x)\\,dx\\), \\(dy/dx=f^{\\prime}(x)\\), so the new meanings are consistent with the former usage.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation.

We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\).

Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other.

The equation \\(|3x-1|=6\\) is of the form \\(|x|=c\\) for \\(c>0\\), so by the Equality Properties, \\(|3x-1|=6\\) is equivalent to \\(3x-1=6\\) or \\(3x-1=-6\\). Solving the former, we arrive at \\(x=\\frac{7}{3}\\), and solving the latter, we get \\(x=-\\frac{5}{3}\\). We may check both of these solutions by substituting them into the original equation and showing that the arithmetic works out.\n2. To use the Equality Properties to solve \\(3-|x+5|=1\\), we first isolate the absolute value. \\[3-|x+5| = 1\\] \\[-|x+5| = -2\\qquad\\text{ subtract }3\\] \\[|x+5| = 2\\qquad\\text{divide by }-1\\] From the Equality Properties, we have \\(x+5=2\\) or \\(x+5=-2\\), and get our solutions to be \\(x=-3\\) or \\(x=-7\\). We leave it to the reader to check both answers in the original equation.\n3. As in the previous example, we first isolate the absolute value in the equation \\(3|2x+1|-5=0\\) and get \\(|2x+1|=\\frac{5}{3}\\). Using the Equality Properties, we have \\(2x+1=\\frac{5}{3}\\) or \\(2x+1=-\\frac{5}{3}\\). Solving the former gives \\(x=\\frac{1}{3}\\) and solving the latter gives \\(x=-\\frac{4}{3}\\). As usual, we may substitute both answers in the original equation to check.\n4. Upon isolating the absolute value in the equation \\(4-|5x+3|=5\\), we get \\(|5x+3|=-1\\). At this point, we know there cannot be any real solution, since, by definition, the absolute value of _anything_ is never negative. We are done.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. Our first objective in solving \\(2-\\ln(x-3)=1\\) is to isolate the logarithm. We get \\(\\ln(x-3)=1\\), which, as an exponential equation, is \\(e^{1}=x-3\\). We get our solution \\(x=e+3\\). On the calculator, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=2-\\ln(x-3)\\) intersects the graph of \\(g(x)=1\\) at \\(x=e+3\\approx 5.718\\).\n3. We can start solving \\(\\log_{6}(x+4)+\\log_{6}(3-x)=1\\) by using the Product Rule for logarithms to rewrite the equation as \\(\\log_{6}\\left[(x+4)(3-x)\\right]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation, we get \\(6^{1}=(x+4)(3-x)\\). This reduces to \\(x^{2}+x-6=0\\), which gives \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\). Graphing \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+4)}{\\ln(6)}+\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(6)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1\\), we see they intersect twice, at \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\).\n4. Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\). When we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+3)}{\\ln(2)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln(6-x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\), we find they intersect at \\(x=5\\).\n\n\n",

For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=L\\), then \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_{n}=L\\).\nAnd a final useful fact:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n4. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the sentence \\(3^{n}>n^{3}\\). Our base case is \\(n=4\\) and we check \\(3^{4}=81\\) and \\(4^{3}=64\\) so that \\(3^{4}>4^{3}\\) as required. We now assume \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is \\(3^{k}>k^{3}\\), and try to show \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. We note that \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}>3k^{3}\\) and so we are done if we can show \\(3k^{3}>(k+1)^{3}\\) for \\(k\\geq 4\\). We can solve the inequality \\(3x^{3}>(x+1)^{3}\\) using the techniques of Section 5.3, and doing so gives us \\(x>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3}-1}\\approx 2.26.\\) Hence, for \\(k\\geq 4\\), \\(3^{k+1}=3\\cdot 3^{k}>3k^{3}>(k+1)^{3}\\) so that \\(3^{k+1}>(k+1)^{3}\\). By induction, \\(3^{n}>n^{3}\\) is true for all natural numbers \\(n\\geq 4\\).\n6. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the sentence \\(\\log\\left(x^{n}\\right)=n\\log(x)\\). For the duration of this argument, we assume \\(x>0\\). The base case \\(P(1)\\) amounts checking that \\(\\log\\left(x^{1}\\right)=1\\log(x)\\) which is clearly true. Next we assume \\(P(k)\\) is true, that is \\(\\log\\left(x^{k}\\right)=k\\log(x)\\) and try to show \\(P(k+1)\\) is true. Using the Product Rule for Logarithms along with the induction hypothesis, we get \\[\\log\\left(x^{k+1}\\right)=\\log\\left(x^{k}\\cdot x\\right)=\\log\\left(x^{k}\\right) +\\log(x)=k\\log(x)+\\log(x)=(k+1)\\log(x)\\] Hence, \\(\\log\\left(x^{k+1}\\right)=(k+1)\\log(x)\\). By induction \\(\\log\\left(x^{n}\\right)=n\\log(x)\\) is true for all \\(x>0\\) and all natural numbers \\(n\\geq 1\\).\n9. Let \\(A\\) be an \\(n\\times n\\) lower triangular matrix. We proceed to prove the \\(\\det(A)\\) is the product of the entries along the main diagonal by inducting on \\(n\\). For \\(n=1\\), \\(A=[a]\\) and \\(\\det(A)=a\\), so the result is (trivially) true. Next suppose the result is true for \\(k\\times k\\) lower triangular matrices. Let \\(A\\) be a \\((k+1)\\times(k+1)\\) lower triangular matrix. Expanding \\(\\det(A)\\) along the first row, we have \\[\\det(A)=\\sum_{p=1}^{n}a_{1p}C_{1p}\\] Since \\(a_{1p}=0\\) for \\(2\\leq p\\leq k+1\\), this simplifies \\(\\det(A)=a_{11}C_{11}\\). By definition, we know that \\(C_{11}=(-1)^{1+1}\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)=\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)\\) where \\(A_{11}\\) is \\(k\\times k\\) matrix obtained by deleting the first row and first column of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is lower triangular, so is \\(A_{11}\\) and, as such, the induction hypothesis applies to \\(A_{11}\\). In other words, \\(\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)\\) is the product of the entries along \\(A_{11}\\)'s main diagonal. Now, the entries on the main diagonal of \\(A_{11}\\) are the entries \\(a_{22}\\), \\(a_{33}\\), ..., \\(a_{(k+1)(k+1)}\\) from the main diagonal of \\(A\\). Hence, \\[\\det(A)=a_{11}\\det\\left(A_{11}\\right)=a_{11}\\left(a_{22}a_{33}\\cdots a_{(k+1) (k+1)}\\right)=a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}\\cdots a_{(k+1)(k+1)}\\] We have \\(\\det(A)\\) is the product of the entries along its main diagonal. This shows \\(P(k+1)\\) is true, and, hence, by induction, the result holds for all \\(n\\times n\\) upper triangular matrices. The \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix \\(I_{n}\\) is a lower triangular matrix whose main diagonal consists of all 1's. Hence, \\(\\det\\left(I_{n}\\right)=1\\), as required.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n2. Moving all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}<2\\log_{2}(x)+3\\) to one side of the inequality, we have \\(\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3<0\\). Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\). Since \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\), we get \\(\\log_{2}(x)=-1\\), which gives us \\(x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\log_{2}(x)=3\\), which yields \\(x=2^{3}=8\\). We use test values which are powers of \\(2\\): \\(0<\\frac{1}{4}<\\frac{1}{2}<1<8<16\\), and from our sign diagram, we see \\(r(x)<0\\) on \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},8\\right)\\). Geometrically, we see the graph of \\(f(x)=\\left(\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{2}\\) is below the graph of \\(y=g(x)=\\frac{2\\ln(x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\) on the solution interval.\n3. We begin to solve \\(x\\log(x+1)\\geq x\\) by subtracting \\(x\\) from both sides to get \\(x\\log(x+1)-x\\geq 0\\). We define \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x\\) and due to the presence of the logarithm, we require \\(x+1>0\\), or \\(x>-1\\). To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=x\\log(x+1)-x=0\\). Factoring, we get \\(x\\left(\\log(x+1)-1\\right)=0\\), which gives \\(x=0\\) or \\(\\log(x+1)-1=0\\). The latter gives \\(\\log(x+1)=1\\), or \\(x+1=10^{1}\\), which admits \\(x=9\\). We select test values \\(x\\) so that \\(x+1\\) is a power of \\(10\\), and we obtain \\(-1<-0.9<0<\\sqrt{10}-1<9<99\\). Our sign diagram gives the solution to be \\((-1,0]\\cup[9,\\infty)\\). The calculator indicates the graph of \\(y=f(x)=x\\log(x+1)\\) is above \\(y=g(x)=x\\) on the solution intervals, and the graphs intersect at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=9\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far.

If \\(\\theta=0\\), then \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) have the same direction. It follows1 that there is a real number \\(k>0\\) so that \\(\\vec{w}=k\\vec{v}\\).

Consider the two nonzero vectors \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) drawn with a common initial point \\(O\\) below. For the moment, assume that the angle between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\), which we'll denote \\(\\theta\\), is acute. We wish to develop a formula for the vector \\(\\vec{p}\\), indicated below, which is called the **orthogonal projection of \\(\\vec{v}\\) onto \\(\\vec{w}\\)**. The vector \\(\\vec{p}\\) is obtained geometrically as follows: drop a perpendicular from the terminal point \\(T\\) of \\(\\vec{v}\\) to the vector \\(\\vec{w}\\) and call the point of intersection \\(R\\). The vector \\(\\vec{p}\\) is then defined as \\(\\vec{p}=\\overrightarrow{OR}\\). Like any vector, \\(\\vec{p}\\) is determined by its magnitude \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|\\) and its direction \\(\\hat{p}\\) according to the formula \\(\\vec{p}=\\|\\vec{p}\\|\\hat{p}\\). Since we want \\(\\hat{p}\\) to have the same direction as \\(\\vec{w}\\), we have \\(\\hat{p}=\\hat{w}\\). To determine \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|\\), we make use of Theorem 10.4 as applied to the right triangle \\(\\triangle ORT\\). We find \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\|\\vec{p}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\), or \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\). To get things in terms of just \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\), we use Theorem 11.23 to get \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos(\\theta)} {\\|\\vec{w}\\|}=\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\). Using Theorem 11.22, we rewrite \\(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}=\\vec{v}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w} \\|}\\vec{w}\\right)=\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{w}\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|=\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{w}\\), and since \\(\\hat{p}=\\hat{w}\\), we now have a formula for \\(\\vec{p}\\) completely in terms of \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\), namely \\(\\vec{p}=\\|\\vec{p}\\|\\hat{p}=(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\hat{w}\\).\nNow suppose that the angle \\(\\theta\\) between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) is obtuse, and consider the diagram below. In this case, we see that \\(\\hat{p}=-\\hat{w}\\) and using the triangle \\(\\triangle ORT\\), we find \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\cos(\\theta^{\\prime})\\). Since \\(\\theta+\\theta^{\\prime}=\\pi\\), it follows that \\(\\cos(\\theta^{\\prime})=-\\cos(\\theta)\\), which means \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\cos(\\theta^{\\prime})=-\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\cos(\\theta)\\). Rewriting this last equation in terms of \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) as before, we get \\(\\|\\vec{p}\\|=-(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})\\). Putting this together with \\(\\hat{p}=-\\hat{w}\\), we get \\(\\vec{p}=\\|\\vec{p}\\|\\hat{p}=-(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{w})(-\\hat{w})=(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{ w})\\hat{w}\\) in this case as well.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1.

We can extend this in the obvious ways to define \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=-\\infty\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 4.10.4** Limit at infinity If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(x>N\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We may similarly define \\(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=L\\), and using the idea of the previous definition, we may define \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe include these definitions for completeness, but we will not explore them in detail. Suffice it to say that such limits behave in much the same way that ordinary limits do; in particular there are some analogs of theorem 2.3.6.\nNow consider this limit:\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nUsually \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the left\" and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)\\) is read \"the limit of \\(f(x)\\) from the right\".\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThis is all straightforward except perhaps for the \"\\(\\leq\\)\". That is an example of the **triangle inequality**, which says that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers then \\(|a+b|\\leq|a|+|b|\\). If you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.\nSince \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\), there is a value \\(\\delta_{1}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{1}\\) implies \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), This means that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{1}\\) implies \\(|f(x)-L||M|<\\epsilon/2\\). You can see where this is going: if we can make \\(|f(x)||g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/2\\) also, then we'll be done.\nWe can make \\(|g(x)-M|\\) smaller than any fixed number by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\); unfortunately, \\(\\epsilon/(2f(x))\\) is not a fixed number, since \\(x\\) is a variable. Here we need another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing \\(x^{2}\\). We can find a \\(\\delta_{2}\\) so that \\(|x-a|<\\delta_{2}\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<1\\), meaning that \\(L-1<f(x)<L+1\\). This means that \\(|f(x)|<N\\), where \\(N\\) is either \\(|L-1|\\) or \\(|L+1|\\), depending on whether \\(L\\) is negative or positive. The important point is that \\(N\\) doesn't depend on \\(x\\). Finally, we know that there is a \\(\\delta_{3}\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta_{3}\\) implies \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Now we're ready to put everything together. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the smallest of \\(\\delta_{1}\\), \\(\\delta_{2}\\), and \\(\\delta_{3}\\). Then \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies that \\(|f(x)-L|<|\\epsilon/(2M)|\\), \\(|f(x)|<N\\), and \\(|g(x)-M|<\\epsilon/(2N)\\). Then\n\n\n",

(AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIn practice, an approximation is useful only if we know how accurate it is; for example, we might need a particular value accurate to three decimal places. When we compute a particular approximation to an integral, the error is the difference between the approximation and the true value of the integral. For any approximation technique, we need an **error estimate**, a value that is guaranteed to be larger than the actual error. If \\(A\\) is an approximation and \\(E\\) is the associated error estimate, then we know that the true value of the integral is between \\(A-E\\) and \\(A+E\\). In the case of our approximation of the integral, we want \\(E=E(\\Delta x)\\) to be a function of \\(\\Delta x\\) that gets small rapidly as \\(\\Delta x\\) gets small. Fortunately, for many functions, there is such an error estimate associated with the trapezoid approximation.\n**THEOREM 8.6.1** Suppose \\(f\\) has a second derivative \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for the trapezoid approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)={{b-a}\\over 12}M(\\Delta x)^{2}={{(b-a)^{3}}\\over 12n^{2}}M.\\]\nLet's see how we can use this.\n6.2 Approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The second derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((4x^{2}-2)e^{-x^{2}}\\), and it is not hard to see that on \\([0,1]\\), \\(|(4x^{2}-2)e^{-x^{2}}|\\leq 2\\). We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\) or\n\\[\\eqalign{{1\\over 12}(2){1\\over n^{2}}&<0.005\\cr{1\\over 6}(200)&<n^{2}\\cr 5.77 \\approx\\sqrt{100\\over 3}&<n\\cr}\\]\nWith \\(n=6\\), the error estimate is thus \\(1/6^{3}<0.0047\\). We compute the trapezoid approximation for six intervals:\n\\[\\left({f(0)\\over 2}+f(1/6)+f(2/6)+\\cdots+f(5/6)+{f(1)\\over 2}\\right){1\\over 6 }\\approx 0.74512.\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNot surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and simplify the integral to get\n\\[\\int_{x_{i+1}-\\Delta x}^{x_{i+1}+\\Delta x}ax^{2}+bx+c\\,dx={\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x _{i})+4f(x_{i+1})+f(x_{i+2})).\\]\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIt is sometimes the case that a situation leads naturally to an equation that defines a function implicitly.\n**Example 4.8.3**: Consider all the points \\((x,y)\\) that have the property that the distance from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((x_{1},y_{1})\\) plus the distance from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((x_{2},y_{2})\\) is \\(2a\\) (\\(a\\) is some constant). These points form an ellipse, which like a circle is not a function but can viewed as two functions pasted together. Because we know how to write down the distance between two points, we can write down an implicit equation for the ellipse:\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-x_{1})^{2}+(y-y_{1})^{2}}+\\sqrt{(x-x_{2})^{2}+(y-y_{2})^{2}}=2a.\\]\nThen we can use implicit differentiation to find the slope of the ellipse at any point, though the computation is rather messy. \\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\n**Example 4.8.4**: We have already justified the power rule by using the exponential function, but we could also do it for rational exponents by using implicit differentiation. Suppose that \\(y=x^{m/n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers. We can write this implicitly as \\(y^{n}=x^{m}\\), then because we justified the power rule for integers, we can take the derivative\nof each side:\n\\[ny^{n-1}y^{\\prime} =mx^{m-1}\\] \\[y^{\\prime} =\\frac{m}{n}\\frac{x^{m-1}}{y^{n-1}}\\] \\[y^{\\prime} =\\frac{m}{n}\\frac{x^{m-1}}{(x^{m/n})^{n-1}}\\] \\[y^{\\prime} =\\frac{m}{n}x^{m-1-(m/n)(n-1)}\\] \\[y^{\\prime} =\\frac{m}{n}x^{m-1-m+(m/n)}\\] \\[y^{\\prime} =\\frac{m}{n}x^{(m/n)-1}\\]\n#### Exercises 4.8\nIn exercises 1-8, find a formula for the derivative \\(y^{\\prime}\\) at the point \\((x,y)\\):\n\n\n",

This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\). Then\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSo the real job is to prove theorem 7.2.2. We will sketch the proof, using some facts that we do not prove. First, the following identity is true of integrals:\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}f(t)\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{c}f(t)\\,dt+\\int_{c}^{b}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nThis can be proved directly from the definition of the integral, that is, using the limits of sums. It is quite easy to see that it must be true by thinking of either of the two applications of integrals that we have seen. It turns out that the identity is true no matter what \\(c\\) is, but it is easiest to think about the meaning when \\(a\\leq c\\leq b\\).\nFirst, if \\(f(t)\\) represents a speed, then we know that the three integrals represent the distance traveled between time \\(a\\) and time \\(b\\); the distance traveled between time \\(a\\) and time \\(c\\); and the distance traveled between time \\(c\\) and time \\(b\\). Clearly the sum of the latter two is equal to the first of these.\nSecond, if \\(f(t)\\) represents the height of a curve, the three integrals represent the area under the curve between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); the area under the curve between \\(a\\) and \\(c\\); and the area under the curve between \\(c\\) and \\(b\\). Again it is clear from the geometry that the first is equal to the sum of the second and third.\n### Chapter 7 Integration\n\n\n",

In lowest terms \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-x-6}{x^{2}-9}=\\frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x-3)(x+3)}=\\frac{x+2}{x+3}\\). Since \\(x=-3\\) continues to make trouble in the denominator, we know the line \\(x=-3\\) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). Since \\(x=3\\) no longer produces a \\(0\\) in the denominator, we have a hole at \\(x=3\\). To find the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the hole, we substitute \\(x=3\\) into \\(\\frac{x+2}{x+3}\\) and find the hole is at \\(\\left(3,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\). When we graph \\(y=g(x)\\) using a calculator, we clearly see the vertical asymptote at \\(x=-3\\), but everything seems calm near \\(x=3\\). Hence, as \\(x\\to-3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\), as \\(x\\to-3^{+}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\), as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\frac{5}{6}^{-}\\), and as \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\frac{5}{6}^{+}\\).\n3. The domain of \\(h\\) is all real numbers, since \\(x^{2}+9=0\\) has no real solutions. Accordingly, the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) is devoid of both vertical asymptotes and holes.\n4. Setting \\(x^{2}+4x+4=0\\) gives us \\(x=-2\\) as the only real number of concern. Simplifying, we see \\(r(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-x-6}{x^{2}+4x+4}=\\frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x+2)^{2}}=\\frac{x-3}{x+2}\\). Since \\(x=-2\\) continues to produce a \\(0\\) in the denominator of the reduced function, we know \\(x=-2\\) is a vertical asymptote to the graph. The calculator bears this out, and, moreover, we see that as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(r(x)\\to\\infty\\) and as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), \\(r(x)\\to-\\infty\\).\nOur next example gives us a physical interpretation of a vertical asymptote. This type of model arises from a family of equations cheerily named 'doomsday' equations.7\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nSo these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the **integral test**, which we state as a theorem.\n**Theorem 11.3.3** Suppose that \\(f(x)>0\\) and is decreasing on the infinite interval \\([k,\\infty)\\) (for some \\(k\\geq 1\\)) and that \\(a_{n}=f(n)\\). Then the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges if and only if the improper integral \\(\\int_{1}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,dx\\) converges.\nThe two examples we have seen are called \\(p\\)-series; a \\(p\\)-series is any series of the form \\(\\sum 1/n^{p}\\). If \\(p\\leq 0\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}1/n^{p}\\neq 0\\), so the series diverges. For positive values of \\(p\\) we can determine precisely which series converge.\n**Theorem 11.3.4** A \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>0\\) converges if and only if \\(p>1\\).\n_Proof._ We use the integral test; we have already done \\(p=1\\), so assume that \\(p\\neq 1\\).\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{p}}\\,dx=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{x^{1-p}\\over 1-p}\\bigg{|} _{1}^{D}=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{D^{1-p}\\over 1-p}-{1\\over 1-p}.\\]\nIf \\(p>1\\) then \\(1-p<0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=0\\), so the integral converges. If \\(0<p<1\\) then \\(1-p>0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=\\infty\\), so the integral diverges.\n**Example 11.3.5** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{3}}\\) converges.\nWe could of course use the integral test, but now that we have the theorem we may simply note that this is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>1\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.6** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{n^{4}}\\) converges.\nWe know that if \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) converges then \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) also converges, by theorem 11.2.2. Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) is a convergent \\(p\\)-series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) converges also. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.7** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) diverges.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\).

Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIf \\(x\\) is positive, then this is the function \\(y=x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(1\\). (Recall that when \\(y=f(x)=mx+b\\), the derivative is the slope \\(m\\).) If \\(x\\) is negative, then we're dealing with the function \\(y=-x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(-1\\). If \\(x=0\\), then the function has a corner, i.e., there is no tangent line. A tangent line would have to point in the direction of the curve--but there are _two_ directions of the curve that come together at the origin. We can summarize this as\n\\[y^{\\prime}=\\cases{1&if $x>0$;\\cr-1&if $x<0$;\\cr\\hbox{undefined}&if $x=0$.}\\]\n##### Example 2.4.5\nDiscuss the derivative of the function \\(y=x^{2/3}\\), shown in figure 2.4.1. We will later see how to compute this derivative; for now we use the fact that \\(y^{\\prime}=(2/3)x^{-1/3}\\). Visually this looks much like the absolute value function, but it technically has a cusp, not a corner. The absolute value function has no tangent line at \\(0\\) because there are (at least) two obvious contenders--the tangent line of the left side of the curve and the tangent line of the right side. The function \\(y=x^{2/3}\\) does not have a tangent line at \\(0\\), but unlike the absolute value function it can be said to have a single direction: as we approach \\(0\\) from either side the tangent line becomes closer and closer to a vertical line; the curve is vertical at \\(0\\). But as before, if you imagine traveling along the curve, an abrupt change in direction is required at \\(0\\): a full \\(180\\) degree turn.\nIn practice we won't worry much about the distinction between these examples; in both cases the function has a \"sharp point\" where there is no tangent line and no derivative.\n### 2.4 The Derivative\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n9.

More precisely, \\((x,f(x))\\) is a local maximum if there is an interval \\((a,b)\\) with \\(a<x<b\\) and \\(f(x)\\geq f(z)\\) for every \\(z\\) in both \\((a,b)\\) and the domain of \\(f\\). Similarly, \\((x,y)\\) is a **local minimum point** if it has locally the smallest \\(y\\) coordinate. Again being more precise: \\((x,f(x))\\) is a local minimum if there is an interval \\((a,b)\\) with \\(a<x<b\\) and \\(f(x)\\leq f(z)\\) for every \\(z\\) in both \\((a,b)\\) and the domain of \\(f\\). A **local extremum** is either a local minimum or a local maximum.\nLocal maximum and minimum points are quite distinctive on the graph of a function, and are therefore useful in understanding the shape of the graph. In many applied problems we want to find the largest or smallest value that a function achieves (for example, we might want to find the minimum cost at which some task can be performed) and so identifying maximum and minimum points will be useful for applied problems as well. Some examples of local maximum and minimum points are shown in figure 5.1.1.\n### Chapter 5 Curve Sketching\nIf \\((x,f(x))\\) is a point where \\(f(x)\\) reaches a local maximum or minimum, and if the derivative of \\(f\\) exists at \\(x\\), then the graph has a tangent line and the tangent line must be horizontal.

This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval.

The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}f(x)-g(x)\\,dx.\\]\nOf course, this is the integral we actually computed above, but we have now arrived at it directly rather than as a modification of the difference between two other integrals. In that example it really doesn't matter which approach we take, but in some cases this second approach is better.\n### Area between curves\n**Example 9.1.2**: Find the area below \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x+1\\) and above \\(g(x)=-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3\\) over the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 2\\); these are the same curves as before but lowered by 2. In figure 9.1.3 we show the two curves together. Note that the lower curve now dips below the \\(x\\)-axis. This makes it somewhat tricky to view the desired area as a big area minus a smaller area, but it is just as easy as before to think of approximating the area by rectangles. The height of a typical rectangle will still be \\(f(x_{i})-g(x_{i})\\), even if \\(g(x_{i})\\) is negative. Thus the area is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{2}-x^{2}+4x+1-(-x^{3}+7x^{2}-10x+3)\\,dx=\\int_{1}^{2}x^{3}-8x^{2}+14x -2\\,dx.\\]\nThis is of course the same integral as before, because the region between the curves is identical to the former region--it has just been moved down by 2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 9.1.3**: Find the area between \\(f(x)=-x^{2}+4x\\) and \\(g(x)=x^{2}-6x+5\\) over the interval \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\); the curves are shown in figure 9.1.4.

Not surprisingly, non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more general equations.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) is a function of two variables. A more general class of first order differential equations has the form \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\). This is not necessarily a linear first order equation, since \\(\\phi\\) may depend on \\(y\\) in some complicated way; note however that \\(\\dot{y}\\) appears in a very simple form. Under suitable conditions on the function \\(\\phi\\), it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable property.\n##### Example 17.4.1\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\) is a first order non-linear equation, because \\(y\\) appears to the second power. We will not be able to solve this equation. \\(\\Box\\)\n##### Example 17.4.2\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\).

This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\).

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n\\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\)--and we want to find the other rate \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\) at that instant. (The use of \\(\\dot{x}\\) to mean \\(dx/dt\\) goes back to Newton and is still used for this purpose, especially by physicists.)\nIf \\(y\\) is written in terms of \\(x\\), i.e., \\(y=f(x)\\), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:\n\\[\\dot{y}=\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{dy}{dx}\\dot{x}.\\]\nThat is, find the derivative of \\(f(x)\\), plug in the value of \\(x\\) at the instant in question, and multiply by the given value of \\(\\dot{x}=dx/dt\\) to get \\(\\dot{y}=dy/dt\\).\nSuppose an object is moving along a path described by \\(y=x^{2}\\), that is, it is moving on a parabolic path. At a particular time, say \\(t=5\\), the \\(x\\) coordinate is \\(6\\) and we measure the speed at which the \\(x\\) coordinate of the object is changing and find that \\(dx/dt=3\\). At the same time, how fast is the \\(y\\) coordinate changing?\nUsing the chain rule, \\(dy/dt=2x\\cdot dx/dt\\). At \\(t=5\\) we know that \\(x=6\\) and \\(dx/dt=3\\), so \\(dy/dt=2\\cdot 6\\cdot 3=36\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nIn many cases, particularly interesting ones, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be related in some other way, for example \\(x=f(y)\\), or \\(F(x,y)=k\\), or perhaps \\(F(x,y)=G(x,y)\\), where \\(F(x,y)\\) and \\(G(x,y)\\) are expressions involving both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides, plugging in all the known values (namely, \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(\\dot{x}\\)), and then solving for \\(\\dot{y}\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\nFinally we substitute to find \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}+A(1)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{6}+A\\] \\[A=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThe solution is then\n\\[y=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}t^{-3}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nHere is an alternate method for finding a particular solution to the differential equation, using an **integrating factor**. In the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), we note that if we multiply through by a function \\(I(t)\\) to get \\(I(t)\\dot{y}+I(t)p(t)y=I(t)f(t)\\), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product rule:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(I(t)y)=I(t)\\dot{y}+I^{\\prime}(t)y.\\]\nNow if we could choose \\(I(t)\\) so that \\(I^{\\prime}(t)=I(t)p(t)\\), this would be exactly the left hand side of the differential equation. But this is just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution is \\(I(t)=e^{Q(t)}\\), where \\(Q(t)=\\int p\\,dt\\); note that \\(Q(t)=-P(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) appears in the variation of parameters method and \\(P^{\\prime}(t)=-p\\). Now the modified differential equation is\n\\[e^{-P(t)}\\dot{y}+e^{-P(t)}p(t)y =e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-P(t)}y) =e^{-P(t)}f(t).\\]\nIntegrating both sides gives\n\\[e^{-P(t)}y =\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt\\] \\[y =e^{P(t)}\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nIf you look carefully, you will see that this is exactly the same solution we found by variation of parameters, because \\(e^{-P(t)}f(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\).\nSome people find it easier to remember how to use the integrating factor method than variation of parameters. Since ultimately they require the same calculation, you should use whichever of the two you find easier to recall. Using this method, the solution of the previous example would look just a bit different: Starting with \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), we recall that the integrating factor is \\(e^{\\int 3/t}=e^{3\\ln t}=t^{3}\\). Then we multiply through by the integrating factor and solve:\n\n\n",

The obvious candidate is a parabola: if we can approximate a short piece of the curve with a parabola with equation \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), we can easily compute the area under the parabola.\nThere are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\) on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval \\([x_{i},x_{i+2}]\\), as in figure 8.6.3. If we divide the interval \\([a,b]\\) into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through \\((x_{i},f(x_{i}))\\), \\((x_{i+1},f(x_{i+1}))\\), and \\((x_{i+2},f(x_{i+2}))\\). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola \\(y=ax^{2}+bx+c\\) through these points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra; you can see how to do it in this Sage worksheet.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFigure 8.6.3: A parabola (dashed) approximating a curve (solid).

(Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\n\n",

In some cases we can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nWe don't actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem--it is enough to know that the sequence is \"eventually\" monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges even without knowing the limit; see exercise 1.)\n**Example 11.1.15** Show that \\(\\{n!/n^{n}\\}\\) converges.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nA sequence is **bounded above** if there is some number \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\), and **bounded below** if there is some number \\(N\\) such that \\(a_{n}\\geq N\\) for every \\(n\\). If a sequence is bounded above and bounded below it is **bounded**. If a sequence \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by \\(a_{0}\\)), and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is bounded above (by \\(a_{0}\\)). Finally, with all this new terminology we can state an important theorem.\n**Theorem 11.1.12** If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.\nWe will not prove this; the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger than some fixed value \\(N\\). The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\). It need not be \\(N\\), since \\(N\\) may be a \"too-generous\" upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that is above all of the terms \\(a_{i}\\).\n**Example 11.1.13** All of the terms \\((2^{i}-1)/2^{i}\\) are less than 2, and the sequence is increasing. As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n37.

For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\).

Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\). If we can find \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) so that \\(\\partial Q/\\partial x-\\partial P/\\partial y=1\\), then the area is also\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy.\\]\nIt is quite easy to do this: \\(P=0,Q=x\\) works, as do \\(P=-y,Q=0\\) and \\(P=-y/2,Q=x/2\\).\n##### Example 16.4.3\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|} \\hline\n2.

Sketching the cycloid by hand is a wonderful exercise in Calculus, but for the purposes of this book, we use a graphing utility. Using a calculator to graph parametric equations is very similar to graphing polar equations on a calculator.13 Ensuring that the calculator is in 'Parametric Mode' and 'radian mode' we enter the equations and advance to the 'Window' screen.\nFootnote 13: See page 959 in Section 11.5.\nAs always, the challenge is to determine appropriate bounds on the parameter, \\(t\\), as well as for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We know that one full revolution of the circle occurs over the interval \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\), so\nit seems reasonable to keep these as our bounds on \\(t\\). The 'Tstep' seems reasonably small - too large a value here can lead to incorrect graphs.14 We know from our derivation of the equations of the cycloid that the center of the generating circle has coordinates \\((r\\theta,r)\\), or in this case, \\((3t,3)\\). Since \\(t\\) ranges between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\), we set \\(x\\) to range between \\(0\\) and \\(6\\pi\\).

It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test or the comparison test, but there is an easier way. Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\). So we might guess that in the long run it\n\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}=a_{N}+a_{N+1}+a_{N+2}+a_{N+3}+\\cdots+a_{N+k}+\\cdots,\\]\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{p}}\\,dx=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{x^{1-p}\\over 1-p}\\bigg{|} _{1}^{D}=\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}{D^{1-p}\\over 1-p}-{1\\over 1-p}.\\]\nIf \\(p>1\\) then \\(1-p<0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=0\\), so the integral converges. If \\(0<p<1\\) then \\(1-p>0\\) and \\(\\lim_{D\\to\\infty}D^{1-p}=\\infty\\), so the integral diverges.\n**Example 11.3.5** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{3}}\\) converges.\nWe could of course use the integral test, but now that we have the theorem we may simply note that this is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p>1\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.6** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{n^{4}}\\) converges.\nWe know that if \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) converges then \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) also converges, by theorem 11.2.2. Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) is a convergent \\(p\\)-series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) converges also. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.7** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) diverges.\nThis also follows from theorem 11.2.2: Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p=1/2<1\\), it diverges, and so does \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSince it is typically difficult to compute the value of a series exactly, a good approximation is frequently required. In a real sense, a good approximation is only as good as we know it is, that is, while an approximation may in fact be good, it is only valuable in practice if we can guarantee its accuracy to some degree. This guarantee is usually easy to come by for series with decreasing positive terms.\n**Example 11.3.8** Approximate \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) to two decimal places.\nReferring to figure 11.3.1, if we approximate the sum by \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}1/n^{2}\\), the error we make is the total area of the remaining rectangles, all of which lie under the curve \\(1/x^{2}\\) from \\(x=N\\) out to infinity. So we know the true value of the series is larger than the approximation, and no bigger than the approximation plus the area under the curve from \\(N\\) to infinity. Roughly, then, we need to find \\(N\\) so that\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nSo given a series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) with both positive and negative terms, you should first ask whether \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) converges. This may be an easier question to answer, because we have tests that apply specifically to series with non-negative terms. If \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) converges then you know that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges as well. If \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) diverges then it still may be true that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges--you will have to do more work to decide the question. Another way to think of this result is: it is (potentially) easier for \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to converge than for \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) to converge, because the latter series cannot take advantage of cancellation.\nIf \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) converges we say that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges **absolutely**; to say that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely is to say that any cancellation that happens to come along is not really needed, as the terms already get small so fast that convergence is guaranteed by that alone. If \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges but \\(\\sum|a_{n}|\\) does not, we say that \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges **conditionally**. For example \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges absolutely, while \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\\frac{1}{n}\\) converges conditionally.\n**Example 11.6.2**: Does \\(\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin n}{n^{2}}\\) converge?\nIn example 11.5.2 we saw that \\(\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin n|}{n^{2}}\\) converges, so the given series converges absolutely.\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.6.3**: Does \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n}\\frac{3n+4}{2n^{2}+3n+5}\\) converge?\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 11.3.6** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{n^{4}}\\) converges.\nWe know that if \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) converges then \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) also converges, by theorem 11.2.2.

Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nand the solution to the differential equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}+(\\sin t+\\cos t)/10\\). For comparison (and practice) you might want to solve this using the method of undetermined coefficients. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 17.7.2**.: The differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=e^{t}\\sin t\\) can be solved using the method of undetermined coefficients, though we have not seen any examples of such a solution.

Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation.

The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like \"the limit of \\((-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2})/\\Delta x\\) as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to zero is \\(-19.6\\),\" and abbreviate this mouthful\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 4.10.2**: What happens to the function \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity? It seems clear that as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger, \\(1/x\\) gets closer and closer to zero, so \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) should be getting closer and closer to \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)__\nAs with ordinary limits, these concepts can be made precise. Roughly, we want \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) to mean that we can make \\(f(x)\\) arbitrarily large by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) should mean we can make \\(f(x)\\) as close as we want to \\(L\\) by making \\(x\\) large enough. Compare this definition to the definition of limit in section 2.3, definition 2.3.2.\n**Definition 4.10.3** If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) if for every \\(N>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) such that whenever \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(f(x)>N\\). We can extend this in the obvious ways to define \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=-\\infty\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 4.10.4** Limit at infinity If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(x>N\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We may similarly define \\(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=L\\), and using the idea of the previous definition, we may define \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe include these definitions for completeness, but we will not explore them in detail. Suffice it to say that such limits behave in much the same way that ordinary limits do; in particular there are some analogs of theorem 2.3.6.\nNow consider this limit:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nBoth the numerator and denominator approach zero, so applying L'Hopital's Rule:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x-1}{\\sin x}=\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sec x\\tan x}{\\cos x}= \\frac{1\\cdot 0}{1}=0.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 4.10.9**: Compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}x\\ln x\\).\nThis doesn't appear to be suitable for L'Hopital's Rule, but it also is not \"obvious\". As \\(x\\) approaches zero, \\(\\ln x\\) goes to \\(-\\infty\\), so the product looks like (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large and negative). But this could be anything: it depends on _how small_ and _how large_. For example, consider \\((x^{2})(1/x)\\), \\((x)(1/x)\\), and \\((x)(1/x^{2})\\). As \\(x\\) approaches zero, each of these is (something very small) \\(\\cdot\\) (something very large), yet the limits are respectively zero, \\(1\\), and \\(\\infty\\).\nWe can in fact turn this into a L'Hopital's Rule problem:\n\\[x\\ln x=\\frac{\\ln x}{1/x}=\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}.\\]\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important). Using L'Hopital's Rule:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{\\ln x}{x^{-1}}=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1/x}{-x^{-2}}= \\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}\\frac{1}{x}(-x^{2})=\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}-x=0.\\]\nOne way to interpret this is that since \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0^{+}}x\\ln x=0\\), the \\(x\\) approaches zero much faster than the \\(\\ln x\\) approaches \\(-\\infty\\).\n\\(\\Box\\)\n**Exercises 4.10.**: Compute the limits.\n**1.**: \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{\\sin x}\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**3.**: \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\sqrt{x^{2}+x}-\\sqrt{x^{2}-x}\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**5.**: \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**7.**: \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sqrt{9+x}-3}{x}\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**9.**: \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}\\frac{2-\\sqrt{x+2}}{4-x^{2}}\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n**11.**: \\(\\lim_{y\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\sqrt{y+1}+\\sqrt{y-1}}{y}\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\n\n",

With \\(r=2\\), \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(n=3\\) the usual computations yield \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)\\), \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{12}\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{ cis}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{2}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\right)\\). If we were to convert these to rectangular form, we would need to use either the Sum and Difference Identities in Theorem 10.16 or the Half-Angle Identities in Theorem 10.19 to evaluate \\(w_{0}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\). Since we are not explicitly told to do so, we leave this as a good, but messy, exercise.\n4. To find the five fifth roots of \\(1\\), we write \\(1=1\\mathrm{cis}(0)\\). We have \\(r=1\\), \\(\\theta=0\\) and \\(n=5\\). Since \\(\\sqrt[5]{1}=1\\), the roots are \\(w_{0}=\\mathrm{cis}(0)=1\\), \\(w_{1}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{3}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{5}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{4}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{8\\pi}{5}\\right)\\). The situation here is even graver than in the previous example, since we have not developed any identities to help us determine the cosine or sine of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\). At this stage, we could approximate our answers using a calculator, and we leave this as an exercise.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nConsider the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes below along with the dashed \\(x^{\\prime}\\)- and \\(y^{\\prime}\\)-axes obtained by rotating the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes counter-clockwise through an angle \\(\\theta\\) and consider the point \\(P(x,y)\\). The coordinates \\((x,y)\\) are rectangular coordinates and are based on the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes. Suppose we wished to find rectangular coordinates based on the \\(x^{\\prime}\\)- and \\(y^{\\prime}\\)-axes. That is, we wish to determine \\(P(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})\\). While this seems like a formidable challenge, it is nearly trivial if we use polar coordinates. Consider the angle \\(\\phi\\) whose initial side is the positive \\(x^{\\prime}\\)-axis and whose terminal side contains the point \\(P\\).\nWe relate \\(P(x,y)\\) and \\(P(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})\\) by converting them to polar coordinates. Converting \\(P(x,y)\\) to polar coordinates with \\(r>0\\) yields \\(x=r\\cos(\\theta+\\phi)\\) and \\(y=r\\sin(\\theta+\\phi)\\). To convert the point \\(P(x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime})\\) into polar coordinates, we first match the polar axis with the positive \\(x^{\\prime}\\)-axis, choose the same \\(r>0\\) (since the origin is the same in both systems) and get \\(x^{\\prime}=r\\cos(\\phi)\\) and \\(y^{\\prime}=r\\sin(\\phi)\\). Using the sum formulas for sine and cosine, we have\n\\[x = r\\cos(\\theta+\\phi)\\] \\[= r\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)-r\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\] Sum formula for cosine \\[= (r\\cos(\\phi))\\cos(\\theta)-(r\\sin(\\phi))\\sin(\\theta)\\] \\[= x^{\\prime}\\cos(\\theta)-y^{\\prime}\\sin(\\theta)\\] Since \\[x^{\\prime}=r\\cos(\\phi)\\] and \\[y^{\\prime}=r\\sin(\\phi)\\]\nSimilarly, using the sum formula for sine we get \\(y=x^{\\prime}\\sin(\\theta)+y^{\\prime}\\cos(\\theta)\\). These equations enable us to easily convert points with \\(x^{\\prime}y^{\\prime}\\)-coordinates back into \\(xy\\)-coordinates. They also enable us to easily convert equations in the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into equations in the variables in terms of \\(x^{\\prime}\\) and \\(y^{\\prime}\\).1 If we want equations which enable us to convert points with \\(xy\\)-coordinates into \\(x^{\\prime}y^{\\prime}\\)-coordinates, we need to solve the system\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. To convert from general form to standard form, we complete the square.7 First, we verify that the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(1\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(x\\), in this case \\(-4\\), and take half of it to get \\(\\frac{1}{2}(-4)=-2\\). This tells us that our target perfect square quantity is \\((x-2)^{2}\\). To get an expression equivalent to \\((x-2)^{2}\\), we need to add \\((-2)^{2}=4\\) to the \\(x^{2}-4x\\) to create a perfect square trinomial, but to keep the balance, we must also subtract it. We collect the terms which create the perfect square and gather the remaining constant terms. Putting it all together, we get \\[f(x) = x^{2}-4x+3\\] (Compute \\(\\frac{1}{2}(-4)=-2\\).) \\[= \\left(x^{2}-4x+\\underline{4}-\\underline{4}\\right)+3\\] (Add and subtract \\[(-2)^{2}=4\\] to \\[(x^{2}+4x)\\] ) \\[= \\left(x^{2}-4x+4\\right)-4+3\\] (Group the perfect square trinomial.) \\[= (x-2)^{2}-1\\] (Factor the perfect square trinomial.) Of course, we can always check our answer by multiplying out \\(f(x)=(x-2)^{2}-1\\) to see that it simplifies to \\(f(x)=x^{2}-4x-1\\). In the form \\(f(x)=(x-2)^{2}-1\\), we readily find the vertex to be \\((2,-1)\\) which makes the axis of symmetry \\(x=2\\). To find the \\(x\\)-intercepts, we set \\(y=f(x)=0\\). We are spoiled for choice, since we have _two_ formulas for \\(f(x)\\). Since we recognize \\(f(x)=x^{2}-4x+3\\) to be easily factorable,8 we proceed to solve \\(x^{2}-4x+3=0\\). Factoring gives \\((x-3)(x-1)=0\\) so that \\(x=3\\) or \\(x=1\\). The \\(x\\)-intercepts are then \\((1,0)\\) and \\((3,0)\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, we set \\(x=0\\). Once again, the general form \\(f(x)=x^{2}-4x+3\\) is easiest to work with here, and we find \\(y=f(0)=3\\). Hence, the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,3)\\). With the vertex, axis of symmetry and the intercepts, we get a pretty good graph without the need to plot additional points. We see that the range of \\(f\\) is \\([-1,\\infty)\\) and we are done. Footnote 7: If you forget why we do what we do to complete the square, start with \\(a(x-h)^{2}+k\\), multiply it out, step by step, and then reverse the process.\n2. To get started, we rewrite \\(g(x)=6-x-x^{2}=-x^{2}-x+6\\) and note that the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(-1\\), not \\(1\\). This means our first step is to factor out the \\((-1)\\) from both the \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(x\\) terms. We then follow the completing the square recipe as above. \\[g(x) = -x^{2}-x+6\\] \\[= (-1)\\left(x^{2}+x\\right)+6\\] (Factor the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) from \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(x\\).) \\[= (-1)\\left(x^{2}+x+\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+6\\] \\[= (-1)\\left(x^{2}+x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+(-1)\\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\right)+6\\] (Group the perfect square trinomial.) \\[= -\\left(x+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{25}{4}\\] (Group the perfect square trinomial.)\nFrom \\(g(x)=-\\left(x+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{25}{4}\\), we get the vertex to be \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{25}{4}\\right)\\) and the axis of symmetry to be \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). To get the \\(x\\)-intercepts, we opt to set the given formula \\(g(x)=6-x-x^{2}=0\\). Solving, we get \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=2\\) , so the \\(x\\)-intercepts are \\((-3,0)\\) and \\((2,0)\\). Setting \\(x=0\\), we find \\(g(0)=6\\), so the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,6)\\). Plotting these points gives us the graph below. We see that the range of \\(g\\) is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\).\nWith Example 2.3.2 fresh in our minds, we are now in a position to show that every quadratic function can be written in standard form. We begin with \\(f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), assume \\(a\\neq 0\\), and complete the square in _complete_ generality.\n\n\n",

To find the domain and range of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\), we note that since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x\\) is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers. To determine the range of \\(f\\), we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7. Choosing our 'key' point to be \\((0,0)\\) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we find that the graph of \\(y=f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) differs from the graph of \\(y=F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) by a horizontal compression by a factor of \\(4\\) and a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\). It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of \\(\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We confirm our findings on the calculator below. 3. To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\nHence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(g(x)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi\\). What about \\(x=0\\)? We know \\(g(0)=\\operatorname{arccot}(0)+\\pi=\\pi\\), and neither of the formulas for \\(g\\) involving arctangent will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph \\(y=g(x)\\) on our calculators, we need to write it as a piecewise defined function:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Suppose the curve \\(z=x\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) plane is rotated around the \\(z\\) axis.

As we saw in Section 10.6, there are two possible ranges for the arcsecant function. Fortunately, both ranges contain \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). Applying Theorem 10.28 / 10.29, we get \\[\\arccos(2x-1) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] \\[\\sec(\\arccos(2x-1)) = \\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\] \\[2x-1 = 2\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Since }\\sec(\\arccos(u))=u\\] \\[x = \\frac{3}{2}\\] To check using our calculator, we need to graph \\(y=3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi\\). To do so, we make use of the identity \\(\\arccos(u)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{u}\\right)\\) from Theorems 10.28 and 10.29.16 We see the graph of \\(y=3\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2x-1}\\right)+\\pi\\) and the horizontal line \\(y=2\\pi\\) intersect at \\(\\frac{3}{2}=1.5\\).\n4. With the presence of both \\(\\arctan^{2}(x)\\) ( \\(=(\\arctan(x))^{2}\\)) and \\(\\arctan(x)\\), we substitute \\(u=\\arctan(x)\\). The equation \\(4\\arctan^{2}(x)-3\\pi\\arctan(x)-\\pi^{2}=0\\) becomes \\(4u^{2}-3\\pi u-\\pi^{2}=0\\). Factoring,17 we get \\((4u+\\pi)(u-\\pi)=0\\), so \\(u=\\arctan(x)=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) or \\(u=\\arctan(x)=\\pi\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arctangent, but \\(\\pi\\) is not, we only get solutions from the first equation. Using Theorem 10.27, we get Footnote 17: It’s not as bad as it looks... don’t let the \\(\\pi\\) throw you! \\[\\arctan(x) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = \\tan\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[x = -1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\tan(\\arctan(u))=u.\\] The calculator verifies our result.\n5. Since the inverse trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, we can solve inequalities featuring these functions using sign diagrams. Since all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\) are on one side of the inequality, we let \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) and note the domain of \\(f\\) is limited by the \\(\\arccos(x)\\) to \\([-1,1]\\). Next, we find the zeros of \\(f\\) by setting \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)=0\\). We get \\(\\arccos(x)=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), and since the range of arccosine is \\([0,\\pi]\\), we focus our attention on \\(\\arccos(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using Theorem 10.26, we get \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\) as our only zero. Hence, we have two test intervals, \\([-1,0)\\) and \\((0,1]\\). Choosing test values \\(x=\\pm 1\\), we get \\(f(-1)=-3\\pi^{2}<0\\) and \\(f(1)=\\pi^{2}>0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\), our answer is \\([-1,0)\\). The calculator confirms that for these values of \\(x\\), the graph of \\(y=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) is below \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis.)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n3. The last equation we are asked to solve, \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), poses two immediate problems. First, we are not told whether or not \\(x\\) represents an angle or a real number. We assume the latter, but note that we will use angles and the Unit Circle to solve the equation regardless. Second, as we have mentioned, there is no universally accepted range of the arcsecant function. For that reason, we adopt the advice given in Section 10.3 and convert this to the cosine problem \\(\\cos(x)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Adopting an angle approach, we consider the equation \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and note that our solutions lie in Quadrants II and III. Since \\(-\\frac{3}{5}\\) isn't the cosine of any of the 'common angles', we'll need to express our solutions in terms of the arccosine function. The real number \\(t=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) is defined so that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\pi\\) with \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). If we let \\(\\beta=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\) radians, we see that \\(\\beta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. To obtain a Quadrant III angle solution, we may simply use \\(-\\beta=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\). Since all angle solutions are coterminal with \\(\\beta\\) or \\(-\\beta\\), we get our solutions to \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) to be \\(\\theta=\\beta+2\\pi k=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(\\theta=-\\beta+2\\pi k=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Switching back to the variable \\(x\\), we record our final answer to \\(\\sec(x)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\) as \\(x=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=-\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\n\n\n",

When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1.

Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n5. We begin this problem in the same manner we began the previous two problems. To help us see the forest for the trees, we let \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\), so our goal is to find a way to express \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\tan(t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\), we know \\(\\cos(t)=x\\) where \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\), but since we are after an expression for \\(\\tan(t)\\), we know we need to throw out \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) from consideration. Hence, either \\(0\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t\\leq\\pi\\) so that, geometrically, \\(t\\) corresponds to an angle in Quadrant I or Quadrant II. One approach3 to finding \\(\\tan(t)\\) is to use the quotient identity \\(\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\cos(t)}\\). Substituting \\(\\cos(t)=x\\) into the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\) gives \\(x^{2}+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\), from which we get \\(\\sin(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Since \\(t\\) corresponds to angles in Quadrants I and II, \\(\\sin(t)\\geq 0\\), so we choose \\(\\sin(t)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Thus, Footnote 3: Alternatively, we could use the identity: \\(1+\\tan^{2}(t)=\\sec^{2}(t)\\). Since \\(x=\\cos(t)\\), \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}=\\frac{1}{x}\\). The reader is invited to work through this approach to see what, if any, difficulties arise. \\[\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\cos(t)}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\] To determine the values of \\(x\\) for which this equivalence is valid, we consider our substitution \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\). Since the domain of \\(\\arccos(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\), we know we must restrict \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). Additionally, since we had to discard \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we need to discard \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). Hence, \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\) is valid for \\(x\\) in \\([-1,0)\\cup(0,1]\\).\n4. We proceed as in the previous problem by writing \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\) so that \\(t\\) lies in the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=x\\). We aim to express \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=\\cos(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(\\cos(2t)\\) is defined everywhere, we get no additional restrictions on \\(t\\) as we did in the previous problem. We have three choices for rewriting \\(\\cos(2t)\\): \\(\\cos^{2}(t)-\\sin^{2}(t)\\), \\(2\\cos^{2}(t)-1\\) and \\(1-2\\sin^{2}(t)\\). Since we know \\(x=\\sin(t)\\), it is easiest to use the last form: \\[\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=\\cos(2t)=1-2\\sin^{2}(t)=1-2x^{2}\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n1. 1. We know \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\\) is the real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\tan(t)=\\sqrt{3}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), so \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The real number \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})\\) lies in the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\sqrt{3}\\). We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\). 3. We can apply Theorem 10.27 directly and obtain \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=-5\\). However, working it through provides us with yet another opportunity to understand why this is the case. Letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-5)\\), we have that \\(t\\) belongs to the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). 4. We start simplifying \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)\\) by letting \\(t=\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\). Then \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\) for some \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Since \\(\\tan(t)<0\\), we know, in fact, \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\). One way to proceed is to use The Pythagorean Identity, \\(1+\\operatorname{cot}^{2}(t)=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\), since this relates the reciprocals of \\(\\tan(t)\\) and \\(\\sin(t)\\) and is valid for all \\(t\\) under consideration.4 From \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\), we get \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\frac{4}{3}\\). Substituting, we get \\(1+\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2}=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\) so that \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=\\pm\\frac{5}{3}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\), we choose \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), so \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). 2. 1. If we let \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\), then \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\tan(t)=x\\). We look for a way to express \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Before we get started using identities, we note that \\(\\tan(2t)\\) is undefined when \\(2t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 tells us we need to exclude values of \\(t\\) where \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. The only members of this family which lie in \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) are \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), which means the values of \\(t\\) under consideration are \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\cup\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{ 4}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Returning to \\(\\arctan(2t)\\), we note the double angle identity \\(\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}\\), is valid for all the values of \\(t\\) under consideration, hence we get \\[\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\]\nTo find where this equivalence is valid we check back with our substitution \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\). Since the domain of \\(\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only exclusions come from the values of \\(t\\) we discarded earlier, \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Since \\(x=\\tan(t)\\), this means we exclude \\(x=\\tan\\left(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\pm 1\\). Hence, the equivalence \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\) holds for all \\(x\\) in \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\). 2. To get started, we let \\(t=\\arccot(2x)\\) so that \\(\\cot(t)=2x\\) where \\(0<t<\\pi\\). In terms of \\(t\\), \\(\\cos(\\arccot(2x))=\\cos(t)\\), and our goal is to express the latter in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(\\cos(t)\\) is always defined, there are no additional restrictions on \\(t\\), so we can begin using identities to relate \\(\\cot(t)\\) to \\(\\cos(t)\\). The identity \\(\\cot(t)=\\frac{\\cos(t)}{\\sin(t)}\\) is valid for \\(t\\) in \\((0,\\pi)\\), so our strategy is to obtain \\(\\sin(t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\), then write \\(\\cos(t)=\\cot(t)\\sin(t)\\). The identity \\(1+\\cot^{2}(t)=\\csc^{2}(t)\\) holds for all \\(t\\) in \\((0,\\pi)\\) and relates \\(\\cot(t)\\) and \\(\\csc(t)=\\frac{1}{\\sin(t)}\\). Substituting \\(\\cot(t)=2x\\), we get \\(1+(2x)^{2}=\\csc^{2}(t)\\), or \\(\\csc(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}\\). Since \\(t\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\csc(t)>0\\), so \\(\\csc(t)=\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}\\) which gives \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}}\\). Hence, \\[\\cos(\\arccot(2x))=\\cos(t)=\\cot(t)\\sin(t)=\\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}}\\] Since \\(\\arccot(2x)\\) is defined for all real numbers \\(x\\) and we encountered no additional restrictions on \\(t\\), we have \\(\\cos\\left(\\arccot(2x)\\right)=\\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{4x^{2}+1}}\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nBefore moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. 1. We begin simplifying \\(\\tan(\\operatorname{arcsec}(x))\\) by letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arcsec}(x)\\). Then, \\(\\operatorname{sec}(t)=x\\) for \\(t\\) in \\(\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cup\\left[\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and we seek a formula for \\(\\tan(t)\\). Since \\(\\tan(t)\\) is defined for all \\(t\\) values under consideration, we have no additional restrictions on \\(t\\). To relate \\(\\operatorname{sec}(t)\\) to \\(\\tan(t)\\), we use the identity \\(1+\\tan^{2}(t)=\\operatorname{sec}^{2}(t)\\). This is valid for all values of \\(t\\) under consideration, and when we substitute \\(\\operatorname{sec}(t)=x\\), we get \\(1+\\tan^{2}(t)=x^{2}\\). Hence, \\(\\tan(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\\). Since \\(t\\) lies in \\(\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\cup\\left[\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), \\(\\tan(t)\\geq 0\\), so we choose \\(\\tan(t)=\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\\). Since we found no additional restrictions on \\(t\\), the equivalence \\(\\tan(\\operatorname{arcsec}(x))=\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\\) holds for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(t=\\operatorname{arcsec}(x)\\), namely \\((-\\infty,-1]\\cup[1,\\infty)\\). 2. To simplify \\(\\cos(\\operatorname{arcsec}(4x))\\), we start by letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arcsec}(4x)\\). Then \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=4x\\) for \\(t\\) in \\(\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\cup\\left(\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right]\\), and we now set about finding an expression for \\(\\cos(\\operatorname{arcsec}(4x))=\\cos(t)\\). Since \\(\\cos(t)\\) is defined for all \\(t\\), we do not encounter any additional restrictions on \\(t\\). From \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=4x\\), we get \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{1}{4x}\\), so to find \\(\\cos(t)\\), we can make use if the identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\). Substituting \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{1}{4x}\\) gives \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\left(\\frac{1}{4x}\\right)^{2}=1\\). Solving, we get \\[\\cos(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{16x^{2}-1}{16x^{2}}}=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{16x^{2}-1}}{4|x|}\\] If \\(t\\) lies in \\(\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\), then \\(\\cos(t)\\geq 0\\), and we choose \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{16x^{2}-1}}{4|x|}\\). Otherwise, \\(t\\) belongs to \\(\\left(\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) in which case \\(\\cos(t)\\leq 0\\), so, we choose \\(\\cos(t)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{16x^{2}-1}}{4|x|}\\) This leads us to a (momentarily) piecewise defined function for \\(\\cos(t)\\) \\[\\cos(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}\\frac{\\sqrt{16x^{2}-1}}{4|x|},& \\text{ if }0\\leq t\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{16x^{2}-1}}{4|x|},&\\text{ if }\\pi<t\\leq\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n\n\n",

The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).

While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\).

The complex number \\(z=-2+4i\\) has \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)=-2\\), \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)=4\\), and is associated with the point \\(P(-2,4)\\). Our next task is to find a polar representation \\((r,\\theta)\\) for \\(P\\) where \\(r\\geq 0\\). Running through the usual calculations gives \\(r=2\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(|z|=2\\sqrt{5}\\). To find \\(\\theta\\), we get \\(\\tan(\\theta)=-2\\), and since \\(r>0\\) and \\(P\\) lies in Quadrant II, we know \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant II angle. We find \\(\\theta=\\pi+\\arctan(-2)+2\\pi k\\), or, more succinctly \\(\\theta=\\pi-\\arctan(2)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Hence \\(\\operatorname{arg}(z)=\\{\\pi-\\arctan(2)+2\\pi k\\,|\\,k\\text{ is an integer}\\}\\). Only \\(\\theta=\\pi-\\arctan(2)\\) satisfies the requirement \\(-\\pi<\\theta\\leq\\pi\\), so \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)=\\pi-\\arctan(2)\\).\n3. We rewrite \\(z=3i\\) as \\(z=0+3i\\) to find \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)=0\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)=3\\). The point in the plane which corresponds to \\(z\\) is \\((0,3)\\) and while we could go through the usual calculations to find the required polar form of this point, we can almost 'see' the answer. The point \\((0,3)\\) lies \\(3\\) units away from the origin on the positive \\(y\\)-axis. Hence, \\(r=|z|=3\\) and \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We get \\(\\arg(z)=\\left\\{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi k\\,|\\,k\\text{ is an integer}\\right\\}\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n4. As in the previous problem, we write \\(z=-117=-117+0i\\) so \\(\\operatorname{Re}(z)=-117\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Im}(z)=0\\). The number \\(z=-117\\) corresponds to the point \\((-117,0)\\), and this is another instance where we can determine the polar form 'by eye'. The point \\((-117,0)\\) is \\(117\\) units away from the origin along the negative \\(x\\)-axis. Hence, \\(r=|z|=117\\) and \\(\\theta=\\pi+2\\pi=(2k+1)\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We have \\(\\arg(z)=\\left\\{(2k+1)\\pi\\,|\\,k\\text{ is an integer}\\right\\}\\). Only one of these values, \\(\\theta=\\pi\\), just barely lies in the interval \\((-\\pi,\\pi]\\) which means and \\(\\operatorname{Arg}(z)=\\pi\\). We plot \\(z\\) along with the other numbers in this example below.\nNow that we've had some practice computing the modulus and argument of some complex numbers, it is time to explore their properties. We have the following theorem.\n\n\n",

To prove this, we check with an \\(x\\) value. After some trial and error, we see that \\(g(1)=5\\) whereas \\(g(-1)=-5\\). This proves that \\(g\\) is not even, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that \\(g\\) is odd. (Why not?) To check if \\(g\\) is odd, we compare \\(g(-x)\\) with \\(-g(x)\\)\n\\[-g(x) = -\\frac{5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[= \\frac{-5x}{2-x^{2}}\\] \\[-g(x) = g(-x)\\]\nHence, \\(g\\) is odd.

We check with an \\(x\\) value, for example, \\(h(1)=5\\) but \\(h(-1)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\). This proves that \\(h\\) is not even and it also shows \\(h\\) is not odd. (Why?) Graphically,\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.4.2**.: The graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are below. (The graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) is bolded.) Use these graphs to answer the following questions.\n1. Solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\). 2. Solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\). 3. Solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\).\n**Solution.**\n1. To solve \\(f(x)=g(x)\\), we look for where the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) intersect. These appear to be at the points \\((-1,2)\\) and \\((1,2)\\), so our solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\).\n2. To solve \\(f(x)<g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is below the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen for the \\(x\\) values less than \\(-1\\) and greater than \\(1\\). Our solution is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\).\n3. To solve \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\), we look for solutions to \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) as well as \\(f(x)>g(x)\\). We solved the former equation and found \\(x=\\pm 1\\). To solve \\(f(x)>g(x)\\), we look for where the graph of \\(f\\) is above the graph of \\(g\\). This appears to happen between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\), on the interval \\((-1,1)\\). Hence, our solution to \\(f(x)\\geq g(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\).\nWe now turn our attention to solving inequalities involving the absolute value. We have the following theorem from Intermediate Algebra to help us.\n**Theorem 2.4. Inequalities Involving the Absolute Value:** Let \\(c\\) be a real number.\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|<c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c<x<c\\).\n* For \\(c>0\\), \\(|x|\\leq c\\) is equivalent to \\(-c\\leq x\\leq c\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n4. 1. The function \\(F\\) is given to us as a set of ordered pairs. The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\nWe have shown that the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1 are one-to-one. This means they are invertible, so it is natural to wonder what \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) would be. For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\). We can track step-by-step what is done to \\(x\\) and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter. The function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x}{1-x}\\) is a bit trickier since \\(x\\) occurs in two places. When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem. Theorem 5.2 tells us equation \\(y=f^{-1}(x)\\) is equivalent to \\(f(y)=x\\) and this is the basis of our algorithm.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nwhich gives \\((x-3)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\). Extracting square roots1 gives \\(x-3=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), so that when we add \\(3\\) to each side,2 we get \\(x=\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Hence, our \\(x\\)-intercepts are \\(\\left(\\frac{6-\\sqrt{2}}{2},0\\right)\\approx(2.29,0)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{6+\\sqrt{2}}{2},0\\right)\\approx(3.71,0)\\). Although our graph doesn't show it, there is a \\(y\\)-intercept which can be found by setting \\(x=0\\). With \\(h(0)=-2(0-3)^{2}+1=-17\\), we have that our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,-17)\\).\nFootnote 1: and rationalizing denominators!\nFootnote 2: and get common denominators!\nA few remarks about Example 2.3.1 are in order. First note that neither the formula given for \\(g(x)\\) nor the one given for \\(h(x)\\) match the form given in Definition 2.5. We could, of course, convert both \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) into that form by expanding and collecting like terms. Doing so, we find \\(g(x)=(x+2)^{2}-3=x^{2}+4x+1\\) and \\(h(x)=-2(x-3)^{2}+1=-2x^{2}+12x-17\\). While these 'simplified' formulas for \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) satisfy Definition 2.5, they do not lend themselves to graphing easily. For that reason, the form of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) presented in Example 2.3.2 is given a special name, which we list below, along with the form presented in Definition 2.5.\n**Definition 2.6**.: **Standard and General Form of Quadratic Functions**: Suppose \\(f\\) is a quadratic function.\n* The **general form** of the quadratic function \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers with \\(a\\neq 0\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. _subtract_\\(4\\)\n2. _divide_ by \\(3\\)\nFollowing this procedure, we get \\(g(x)=\\frac{x-4}{3}\\). Let's check to see if the function \\(g\\) does the job. If \\(x=5\\), then \\(f(5)=3(5)+4=15+4=19\\). Taking the output \\(19\\) from \\(f\\), we substitute it into \\(g\\) to get \\(g(19)=\\frac{19-4}{3}=\\frac{15}{3}=5\\), which is our original input to \\(f\\). To check that \\(g\\) does the job for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), we take the generic output from \\(f\\), \\(f(x)=3x+4\\), and substitute that into \\(g\\). That is, \\(g(f(x))=g(3x+4)=\\frac{(3x+4)-4}{3}=\\frac{3x}{3}=x\\), which is our original input to \\(f\\). If we carefully examine the arithmetic as we simplify \\(g(f(x))\\), we actually see \\(g\\) first 'undoing' the addition of \\(4\\), and then 'undoing' the multiplication by \\(3\\). Not only does \\(g\\) undo \\(f\\), but \\(f\\) also undoes \\(g\\). That is, if we take the output from \\(g\\), \\(g(x)=\\frac{x-4}{3}\\), and put that into \\(f\\), we get \\(f(g(x))=f\\left(\\frac{x-4}{3}\\right)=3\\left(\\frac{x-4}{3}\\right)+4=(x-4)+4=x\\). Using the language of function composition developed in Section 5.1, the statements \\(g(f(x))=x\\) and \\(f(g(x))=x\\) can be written as \\((g\\circ f)(x)=x\\) and \\((f\\circ g)(x)=x\\), respectively. Abstractly, we can visualize the relationship between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in the diagram below.\n### 5.2 Inverse Functions\nThe main idea to get from the diagram is that \\(g\\) takes the outputs from \\(f\\) and returns them to their respective inputs, and conversely, \\(f\\) takes outputs from \\(g\\) and returns them to their respective inputs. We now have enough background to state the central definition of the section.\n\n\n",

What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this series the sizes of the terms decrease, that is, \\(|a_{n}|\\) forms a decreasing sequence, but this is not required in an alternating series. As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.\n**THEOREM 11.4.1** Suppose that \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\). Then the alternating series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\) converges.\n_Proof._ The odd numbered partial sums, \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a non-increasing sequence, because \\(s_{2k+3}=s_{2k+1}-a_{2k+2}+a_{2k+3}\\leq s_{2k+1}\\), since \\(a_{2k+2}\\geq a_{2k+3}\\). This\nFigure 11.4.1: The alternating harmonic series.\nsequence is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so it must converge, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=L\\). Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form a non-decreasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k}=M\\). Since \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\) and \\(s_{2k+1}=s_{2k}+a_{2k+1}\\),\n\\[L=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(s_{2k}+a_{2k+1})=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty }s_{2k}+\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}a_{2k+1}=M+0=M,\\]\nso \\(L=M\\), the two sequences of partial sums converge to the same limit, and this means the entire sequence of partial sums also converges to \\(L\\).\nAnother useful fact is implicit in this discussion. Suppose that\n\\[L=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThus when \\(|x|<1\\) the series converges and when \\(|x|>1\\) it diverges, leaving only two values in doubt. When \\(x=1\\) the series is the harmonic series and diverges; when \\(x=-1\\) it is the alternating harmonic series (actually the negative of the usual alternating harmonic series) and converges. Thus, we may think of \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{x^{n}\\over n}\\) as a function from the interval \\([-1,1)\\) to the real numbers. \\(\\Box\\)\nA bit of thought reveals that the ratio test applied to a power series will always have the same nice form. In general, we will compute\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{|a_{n+1}||x|^{n+1}\\over|a_{n}||x|^{n}}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|x|{ |a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}=|x|\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{|a_{n+1}|\\over|a_{n}|}=L|x|,\\]\nassuming that \\(\\lim|a_{n+1}|/|a_{n}|\\) exists. Then the series converges if \\(L|x|<1\\), that is, if \\(|x|<1/L\\), and diverges if \\(|x|>1/L\\). Only the two values \\(x=\\pm 1/L\\) require further\ninvestigation. Thus the series will definitely define a function on the interval \\((-1/L,1/L)\\), and perhaps will extend to one or both endpoints as well. Two special cases deserve mention: if \\(L=0\\) the limit is \\(0\\) no matter what value \\(x\\) takes, so the series converges for all \\(x\\) and the function is defined for all real numbers. If \\(L=\\infty\\), then for any non-zero value of \\(x\\) the limit is infinite, so the series converges only when \\(x=0\\). The value \\(1/L\\) is called the **radius of convergence** of the series, and the interval on which the series converges is the **interval of convergence**.\nConsider again the geometric series,\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThis says simply that the size of \\(a_{n}\\) gets close to zero if and only if \\(a_{n}\\) gets close to zero.\n**Example 11.1.5**.: Determine whether \\(\\left\\{\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\) converges or diverges.

So, our final answer is \\((2.00,1.00)\\).16 (What does the \\(y\\) value listed on the calculator screen mean in this problem?) \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[{d\\over ds}{\\bf T}(g(s))={\\bf T}^{\\prime}(g(s))g^{\\prime}(s)={\\bf T}^{\\prime} (t){dt\\over ds}.\\]\nThe curvature is the length of this vector:\n\\[\\kappa=|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)||{dt\\over ds}|={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|ds/dt|} ={|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|\\over|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|}.\\]\n(Recall that we have seen that \\(ds/dt=|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|\\).)

Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=1/2\\), as before.\n### 13.3 Arc length and curvature\n**Example 13.3.8** Consider this circle of radius \\(a\\): \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle a\\cos t,a\\sin t,1\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=a\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle/a\\). Now \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\cos t,-a\\sin t,0\\rangle/a\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/a\\): the curvature of a circle is everywhere the reciprocal of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous example is \\(1/2\\); this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius \\(2\\), as shown in figure 13.3.1.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle 3\\cos t,2t,3\\sin t\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,2\\pi]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle t^{2},2,t^{3}\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,1]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle t^{2},\\sin t,\\cos t\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,1]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of the curve \\(y=x^{3/2}\\), \\(x\\in[1,9]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Set up an integral to compute the length of \\(\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,e^{t}\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,5]\\).

We begin solving \\(2\\sin(x)\\leq 1\\) by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and zero on the other to get \\(2\\sin(x)-1\\leq 0\\). Next, we let \\(f(x)=2\\sin(x)-1\\) and note that our original inequality is equivalent to solving \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\). We now look to see where, if ever, \\(f\\) is undefined and where \\(f(x)=0\\).

Solving \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=0\\) for \\(x\\) gives us \\(x=\\pm 10\\). We are interested only in \\(x>0\\), so only the value \\(x=10\\) is of interest.

Market research tells you that if you set the price at $1.50, you will be able to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you lower the price below $1.50 you will be able to sell another 1000 items. Suppose that your fixed costs (\"start-up costs\") total $2000, and the per item cost of production (\"marginal cost\") is $0.50. Find the price to set per item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also determine the maximum profit you can get.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation.

Sometimes this is a simple problem, since it will be apparent that the function you wish to integrate is a derivative in some straightforward way. For example, faced with\n\\[\\int x^{10}\\,dx\\]\nwe realize immediately that the derivative of \\(x^{11}\\) will supply an \\(x^{10}\\): \\((x^{11})^{\\prime}=11x^{10}\\). We don't want the \"11\", but constants are easy to alter, because differentiation \"ignores\" them in certain circumstances, so\n\\[{d\\over dx}{1\\over 11}x^{11}={1\\over 11}1x^{10}=x^{10}.\\]\nFrom our knowledge of derivatives, we can immediately write down a number of antiderivatives. Here is a list of those most often used:\n\\[\\int x^{n}\\,dx={x^{n+1}\\over n+1}+C,\\quad{\\rm if}\\ n\\neq-1\\]\n\\[\\int x^{-1}\\,dx=\\ln|x|+C\\]\n\\[\\int e^{x}\\,dx=e^{x}+C\\]\n\\[\\int\\sin x\\,dx=-\\cos x+C\\]\n### 8 Techniques of Integration\n\\[\\int\\cos x\\,dx=\\sin x+C\\] \\[\\int\\sec^{2}x\\,dx=\\tan x+C\\] \\[\\int\\sec x\\tan x\\,dx=\\sec x+C\\] \\[\\int\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx=\\arctan x+C\\] \\[\\int\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\\,dx=\\arcsin x+C\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nIs cos(\\pi/8) equal to (\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}})/2?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n2. \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=4\\) \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) \\(\\cot\\left(3x\\right)=0.87\\)\n**Solution.**\n1. The solutions to \\(\\cos(u)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) are \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n### 8.3 Trigonometric Substitutions\nSo far we have seen that it sometimes helps to replace a subexpression of a function by a single variable. Occasionally it can help to replace the original variable by something more complicated. This seems like a \"reverse\" substitution, but it is really no different in principle than ordinary substitution.\n**Example 8.3.1**: Evaluate \\(\\int\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx\\). Let \\(x=\\sin u\\) so \\(dx=\\cos u\\,du\\). Then\n\\[\\int\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\int\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}u}\\cos u\\,du=\\int\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u} \\cos u\\,du.\\]\nWe would like to replace \\(\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u}\\) by \\(\\cos u\\), but this is valid only if \\(\\cos u\\) is positive, since \\(\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u}\\) is positive. Consider again the substitution \\(x=\\sin u\\). We could just as well think of this as \\(u=\\arcsin x\\). If we do, then by the definition of the arcsine, \\(-\\pi/2\\leq u\\leq\\pi/2\\), so \\(\\cos u\\geq 0\\). Then we continue:\n\\[\\int\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}u}\\cos u\\,du =\\int\\cos^{2}u\\,du=\\int\\frac{1+\\cos 2u}{2}\\,du=\\frac{u}{2}+ \\frac{\\sin 2u}{4}+C\\] \\[=\\frac{\\arcsin x}{2}+\\frac{\\sin(2\\arcsin x)}{4}+C.\\]\nThis is a perfectly good answer, though the term \\(\\sin(2\\arcsin x)\\) is a bit unpleasant. It is possible to simplify this. Using the identity \\(\\sin 2x=2\\sin x\\cos x\\), we can write \\(\\sin 2u=2\\sin u\\cos u=2\\sin(\\arcsin x)\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}u}=2x\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2} (\\arcsin x)}=2x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}.\\) Then the full antiderivative is\n\\[\\frac{\\arcsin x}{2}+\\frac{2x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{4}=\\frac{\\arcsin x}{2}+\\frac{x \\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{2}+C.\\]\nThis type of substitution is usually indicated when the function you wish to integrate contains a polynomial expression that might allow you to use the fundamental identity \\(\\sin^{2}x+\\cos^{2}x=1\\) in one of three forms:\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n1. Using Theorem 10.3 from Section 10.2 with \\(x=-3\\) and \\(y=4\\), we find \\(r=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{4}{5}\\). Applying Theorem 10.17, we get \\(\\cos(2\\theta)=\\cos^{2}(\\theta)-\\sin^{2}(\\theta)=\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2}- \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{2}=-\\frac{7}{25}\\), and \\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=2\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac {3}{5}\\right)=-\\frac{24}{25}\\). Since both cosine and sine of \\(2\\theta\\) are negative, the terminal side of \\(2\\theta\\), when plotted in standard position, lies in Quadrant III.\n2. If your first reaction to '\\(\\sin(\\theta)=x\\)' is 'No it's not, \\(\\cos(\\theta)=x\\)!' then you have indeed learned something, and we take comfort in that. However, context is everything. Here, '\\(x\\)' is just a variable - it does not necessarily represent the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point on The Unit Circle which lies on the terminal side of \\(\\theta\\), assuming \\(\\theta\\) is drawn in standard position. Here, \\(x\\) represents the quantity \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\), and what we wish to know is how to express \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). We will see more of this kind of thing in Section 10.6, and, as usual, this is something we need for Calculus. Since \\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\), we need to write \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) in terms of \\(x\\) to finish the problem. We substitute \\(x=\\sin(\\theta)\\) into the Pythagorean Identity, \\(\\cos^{2}(\\theta)+\\sin^{2}(\\theta)=1\\), to get \\(\\cos^{2}(\\theta)+x^{2}=1\\), or \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\leq\\theta\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\geq 0\\), and thus \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Our final answer is \\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=2x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\).\n3. We start with the right hand side of the identity and note that \\(1+\\tan^{2}(\\theta)=\\sec^{2}(\\theta)\\). From this point, we use the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities to rewrite \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sec(\\theta)\\) in terms of \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\): \\[\\frac{2\\tan(\\theta)}{1+\\tan^{2}(\\theta)} = \\frac{2\\tan(\\theta)}{\\sec^{2}(\\theta)}=\\frac{2\\left(\\frac{\\sin( \\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\cos^{2}(\\theta)}}=2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\\cos^{2}(\\theta)\\] \\[= 2\\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\\cos(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=\\sin(2\\theta)\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nSince \\(k\\) is a whole number, \\(\\cos(\\theta+2\\pi k)=\\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta+2\\pi k)=\\sin(\\theta)\\). Hence, it follows that \\(\\mathrm{cis}(\\theta+2\\pi k)=\\mathrm{cis}(\\theta)\\), so \\((w_{k})^{n}=r\\mathrm{cis}(\\theta)=z\\), as required. To show that the formula in Theorem 11.17 generates \\(n\\) distinct numbers, we assume \\(n\\geq 2\\) (or else there is nothing to prove) and note that the modulus of each of the \\(w_{k}\\) is the same, namely \\(\\sqrt[n]{r}\\). Therefore, the only way any two of these polar forms correspond to the same number is if their arguments are coterminal - that is, if the arguments differ by an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\). Suppose \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) are whole numbers between \\(0\\) and \\((n-1)\\), inclusive, with \\(k\\neq j\\). Since \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) are different, let's assume for the sake of argument that \\(k>j\\). Then \\(\\left(\\tfrac{\\theta}{n}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{n}k\\right)-\\left(\\tfrac{\\theta}{n}+ \\tfrac{2\\pi}{n}j\\right)=2\\pi\\left(\\tfrac{k-j}{n}\\right)\\). For this to be an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\), \\((k-j)\\) must be a multiple of \\(n\\). But because of the restrictions on \\(k\\) and \\(j\\), \\(0<k-j\\leq n-1\\). (Think this through.) Hence, \\((k-j)\\) is a positive number less than \\(n\\), so it cannot be a multiple of \\(n\\). As a result, \\(w_{k}\\) and \\(w_{j}\\) are different complex numbers, and we are done. By Theorem 3.14, we know there at most \\(n\\) distinct solutions to \\(w^{n}=z\\), and we have just found all of them. We illustrate Theorem 11.17 in the next example.\n\n\n",

Why not just lump them all together and, instead of forcing \\(n\\) to be a natural number, \\(n=1,2,\\ldots\\), allow \\(n\\) to be a whole number, \\(n=0,1,2,\\ldots\\). We could unify all\nof the cases, since, after all, isn't \\(a_{0}x^{0}=a_{0}\\)? The answer is 'yes, as long as \\(x\\neq 0\\).' The function \\(f(x)=3\\) and \\(g(x)=3x^{0}\\) are different, because their domains are different. The number \\(f(0)=3\\) is defined, whereas \\(g(0)=3(0)^{0}\\) is not.3 Indeed, much of the theory we will develop in this chapter doesn't include the constant functions, so we might as well treat them as outsiders from the start. One good thing that comes from Definition 3.2 is that we can now think of linear functions as degree 1 (or 'first degree') polynomial functions and quadratic functions as degree 2 (or 'second degree') polynomial functions.\nFootnote 3: Technically, \\(0^{0}\\) is an indeterminant form, which is a special case of being undefined. The authors realize this is beyond pedantry, but we wouldn’t mention it if we didn’t feel it was neccessary.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nThe Intermediate Value Theorem is extremely profound; it gets to the heart of what it means to be a real number, and is one of the most often used and under appreciated theorems in Mathematics. With that being said, most students see the result as common sense since it says, geometrically, that the graph of a polynomial function cannot be above the \\(x\\)-axis at one point and below the \\(x\\)-axis at another point without crossing the \\(x\\)-axis somewhere in between. The following example uses the Intermediate Value Theorem to establish a fact that that most students take for granted. Many students, and sadly some instructors, will find it silly.\n**Example 3.1.4**.: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to establish that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is a real number.\n**Solution.** Consider the polynomial function \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2\\). Then \\(f(1)=-1\\) and \\(f(3)=7\\). Since \\(f(1)\\) and \\(f(3)\\) have different signs, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees us a real number \\(c\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(3\\) with \\(f(c)=0\\). If \\(c^{2}-2=0\\) then \\(c=\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\). Since \\(c\\) is between \\(1\\) and \\(3\\), \\(c\\) is positive, so \\(c=\\sqrt{2}\\).\nOur primary use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in the construction of sign diagrams, as in Section 2.4, since it guarantees us that polynomial functions are always positive (\\(+\\)) or always negative (\\(-\\)) on intervals which do not contain any of its zeros. The general algorithm for polynomials is given below.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n### 3.4 Complex Zeros and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nIn Section 3.3, we were focused on finding the real zeros of a polynomial function. In this section, we expand our horizons and look for the non-real zeros as well. Consider the polynomial \\(p(x)=x^{2}+1\\). The zeros of \\(p\\) are the solutions to \\(x^{2}+1=0\\), or \\(x^{2}=-1\\). This equation has no real solutions, but you may recall from Intermediate Algebra that we can formally extract the square roots of both sides to get \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{-1}\\). The quantity \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is usually re-labeled \\(i\\), the so-called **imaginary unit**.1 The number \\(i\\), while not a real number, plays along well with real numbers, and acts very much like any other radical expression. For instance, \\(3(2i)=6i\\), \\(7i-3i=4i\\), \\((2-7i)+(3+4i)=5-3i\\), and so forth. The key properties which distinguish \\(i\\) from the real numbers are listed below.\nFootnote 1: Some Technical Mathematics textbooks label it ‘\\(j\\)’.\n**Definition 3.4**.: The imaginary unit \\(i\\) satisfies the two following properties\n1. \\(i^{2}=-1\\)\n2. If \\(c\\) is a real number with \\(c\\geq 0\\) then \\(\\sqrt{-c}=i\\sqrt{c}\\)\nProperty 1 in Definition 3.4 establishes that \\(i\\) does act as a square root2 of \\(-1\\), and property 2 establishes what we mean by the 'principal square root' of a negative real number. In property 2, it is important to remember the restriction on \\(c\\). For example, it is perfectly acceptable to say \\(\\sqrt{-4}=i\\sqrt{4}=i(2)=2i\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{-(-4)}\\neq i\\sqrt{-4}\\), otherwise, we'd get\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nWe now return to the business of zeros. Suppose we wish to find the zeros of \\(f(x)=x^{2}-2x+5\\). To solve the equation \\(x^{2}-2x+5=0\\), we note that the quadratic doesn't factor nicely, so we resort to the Quadratic Formula, Equation 2.5 and obtain\n\\[x=\\frac{-(-2)\\pm\\sqrt{(-2)^{2}-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{-16}}{2}=\\frac {2\\pm 4i}{2}=1\\pm 2i.\\]\nTwo things are important to note. First, the zeros \\(1+2i\\) and \\(1-2i\\) are complex conjugates. If ever we obtain non-real zeros to a quadratic function with real coefficients, the zeros will be a complex conjugate pair. (Do you see why?) Next, we note that in Example 3.4.1, part 6, we found \\((x-[1+2i])(x-[1-2i])=x^{2}-2x+5\\). This demonstrates that the factor theorem holds even for non-real zeros, i.e, \\(x=1+2i\\) is a zero of \\(f\\), and, sure enough, \\((x-[1+2i])\\) is a factor of \\(f(x)\\). It turns out that polynomial division works the same way for all complex numbers, real and non-real alike, so the Factor and Remainder Theorems hold as well. But how do we know if a\ngeneral polynomial has any complex zeros at all? We have many examples of polynomials with no real zeros. Can there be polynomials with no zeros whatsoever? The answer to that last question is \"No.\" and the theorem which provides that answer is The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nFind the solutions y of the differential equation y'=(t^2+3y^2)/2ty with y(1) = 1. What is y(2)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 17.6 Second Order Linear Equations\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\). Show that the steady state part of the solution has amplitude \\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(k-m\\omega^{2})^{2}+\\omega^{2}b^{2}}}.\\] Show that this amplitude is largest when \\(\\omega=\\frac{\\sqrt{4mk-2b^{2}}}{2m}\\). This is the **resonant frequency** of the system.\n### 17.7 Second Order Linear Equations, Take Two\nThe method of the last section works only when the function \\(f(t)\\) in \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\) has a particularly nice form, namely, when the derivatives of \\(f\\) look much like \\(f\\) itself. In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\). Compute the derivatives:\n\\[\\dot{y} = \\dot{u}y_{1}+u\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+v\\dot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\ddot{y} = \\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1} +\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}.\\]\n### Chapter 17 Differential Equations\nNow substituting:\n\\[\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy =\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+u\\ddot{y}_{1}+ \\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}+v\\ddot{y}_{2}\\] \\[\\qquad+b\\dot{u}y_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+b\\dot{v}y_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{2}+cuy_ {1}+cvy_{2}\\] \\[=(u\\ddot{y}_{1}+bu\\dot{y}_{1}+cuy_{1})+(v\\ddot{y}_{2}+bv\\dot{y}_{ 2}+cvy_{2})\\] \\[\\qquad+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y} _{1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})\\] \\[=0+0+b(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2})+(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{ 1}+\\ddot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2})+(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}).\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nAs you might guess, a first order linear differential equation has the form \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Not only is this closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\). Let \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). Then\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\nIf we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get\n\\[\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t\\] \\[\\dot{v} =e^{-3t}\\sin t\\] \\[v =-\\frac{1}{10}(3\\sin t+\\cos t)e^{-3t},\\]\nusing integration by parts.

For comparison (and practice) you might want to solve this using the method of undetermined coefficients. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 17.7.2**.: The differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=e^{t}\\sin t\\) can be solved using the method of undetermined coefficients, though we have not seen any examples of such a solution. Again, we will solve it by variation of parameters.

If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius \\(1\\), the coordinates of\n\nDocument 4:\n----\npoint \\(A\\) are \\((\\cos x,\\sin x)\\), and the area of the small triangle is \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\). This triangle is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(A\\). Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see \\((\\cos x\\sin x)/2\\leq x/2\\), since the area of a circular region with angle \\(\\theta\\) and radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\theta r^{2}/2\\). With a little algebra this turns into \\((\\sin x)/x\\leq 1/\\cos x\\), giving us the \\(h\\) we seek.\nTo find \\(g\\), we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height of the triangle, from \\((1,0)\\) to point \\(B\\), is \\(\\tan x\\), so comparing areas we get \\(x/2\\leq(\\tan x)/2=\\sin x/(2\\cos x)\\). With a little algebra this becomes \\(\\cos x\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\). So now we have\n\\[\\cos x\\leq\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\leq\\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\\]\nFigure 4.3.2: Visualizing \\(\\sin x/x\\).\n### A hard limit\nFinally, the two limits \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\cos x\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}1/\\cos x\\) are easy, because \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nLet h(x) = (x^{-1/2} + 2x)(7 - x^{-1}). What is h'(x) when x = 4?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. Proceeding as before, we determine the domain of \\(g\\) by solving \\(x+1=0\\). As before, we find the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,\\infty)\\). To write \\(g(x)\\) in the form requested, we need to get a common denominator \\[g(x) = 2-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\qquad=\\ \\ \\frac{2}{1}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2)(x+1)}{(1)(x+1)}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x+2)-3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\] This formula is now completely simplified.\n3. The denominators in the formula for \\(h(x)\\) are both \\(x^{2}-1\\) whose zeros are \\(x=\\pm 1\\). As a result, the domain of \\(h\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\). We now proceed to simplify \\(h(x)\\). Since we have the same denominator in both terms, we subtract the numerators. We then factor the resulting numerator and denominator, and cancel out the common factor. \\[h(x) = \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}-\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{\\left(2x^{2}-1\\right)-(3x-2)}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-1-3x+2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-3x+1}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\ \\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\]\n4. To find the domain of \\(r\\), it may help to temporarily rewrite \\(r(x)\\) as \\[r(x)=\\frac{\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}}{\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}}\\] We need to set all of the denominators equal to zero which means we need to solve not only \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), but also \\(\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}=0\\). We find \\(x=\\pm 1\\) for the former and \\(x=\\frac{2}{3}\\) for the latter. Our domain is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup\\left(-1,\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{2}{3},1\\right)\\cup (1,\\infty)\\). We simplify \\(r(x)\\) by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and then by canceling the common factor\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n9. The expression \\((h\\circ(g\\circ f))(x)\\) indicates that we first find the composite, \\(g\\circ f\\) and compose the function \\(h\\) with the result.

Next, we set the denominator to zero and solve: \\(\\left(2-\\sqrt{x^{2}-4x+3}\\right)+1=0\\). We get \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}-4x+3}=3\\), and, after squaring both sides, we have \\(x^{2}-4x+3=9\\).

The reader is encouraged to check that both of these numbers satisfy the original equation, \\(\\left(2-\\sqrt{x^{2}-4x+3}\\right)+1=0\\).

The expression \\(((h\\circ g)\\circ f)(x)\\) indicates that we first find the composite \\(h\\circ g\\) and then compose that with \\(f\\). From number 4, we have \\[(h\\circ g)(x)=\\frac{4-2\\sqrt{x+3}}{3-\\sqrt{x+3}}\\]\nWe now proceed as before.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* _outside in_: This approach yields \\[(h\\circ h)(x) = h(h(x))=\\frac{2(h(x))}{h(x)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1} \\right)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{4x}{3x+1}\\hskip 56.905512pt\\mbox{same algebra as before}\\] To find the domain of \\(h\\circ h\\), we analyze \\[(h\\circ h)(x)=\\frac{2\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1} \\right)+1}\\] To keep the denominator \\(x+1\\) happy, we need \\(x\\neq-1\\).

We can graph \\(g\\) using the six step procedure outlined in Section 4.2. We get the sole intercept at \\((0,0)\\), a vertical asymptote \\(x=1\\) and a horizontal asymptote (which the graph never crosses) \\(y=-2\\). We see from that the graph of \\(g\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test.\n3. 1. We begin with \\(h(c)=h(d)\\). As we work our way through the problem, we encounter a nonlinear equation. We move the non-zero terms to the left, leave a \\(0\\) on the right and factor accordingly. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}h(c)&=&h(d)\\\\ c^{2}-2c+4&=&d^{2}-2d+4\\\\ c^{2}-2c&=&d^{2}-2d\\\\ c^{2}-d^{2}-2c+2d&=&0\\\\ (c+d)(c-d)-2(c-d)&=&0\\\\ (c-d)((c+d)-2)&=&0\\\\ c-d=0&\\mbox{or}&c+d-2=0\\\\ c=d&\\mbox{or}&c=2-d\\end{array}\\] factor by grouping We get \\(c=d\\) as one possibility, but we also get the possibility that \\(c=2-d\\). This suggests that \\(f\\) may not be one-to-one. Taking \\(d=0\\), we get \\(c=0\\) or \\(c=2\\). With \\(f(0)=4\\) and \\(f(2)=4\\), we have produced two different inputs with the same output meaning \\(f\\) is not one-to-one. 2. We note that \\(h\\) is a quadratic function and we graph \\(y=h(x)\\) using the techniques presented in Section 2.3. The vertex is \\((1,3)\\) and the parabola opens upwards. We see immediately from the graph that \\(h\\) is not one-to-one, since there are several horizontal lines which cross the graph more than once.\n4. 1. The function \\(F\\) is given to us as a set of ordered pairs. The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\n\n\n",

In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above. We compute \\(\\int_{C}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}\\) in two ways.\nFirst we do it directly: a vector function for \\(C\\) is \\({\\bf r}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,2-\\sin u\\rangle\\), so \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle-\\sin u,\\cos u,-\\cos u\\rangle\\), and the integral is then\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}y^{2}\\sin u+x\\cos u-z^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sin^{3}u+ \\cos^{2}u-(2-\\sin u)^{2}\\cos u\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nTo use Stokes's Theorem, we pick a surface with \\(C\\) as the boundary; the simplest such surface is that portion of the plane \\(y+z=2\\) inside the cylinder. This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow we can use the chain rule again to evaluate the derivatives inside this integral, and it becomes\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}&Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}+R_{z}g_{x}g_{ y}+Rg_{yx}-\\left(P_{y}+P_{z}g_{y}+R_{y}g_{x}+R_{z}g_{y}g_{x}+Rg_{xy}\\right)\\,dA\\cr&= \\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}Q_{x}+Q_{z}g_{x}+R_{x}g_{y}-P_{y}-P_{z}g_{y}-R_{y}g_ {x}\\,dA,}\\]\nwhich is the same as the expression we obtained for the surface integral.\n### 16 Vector Calculus\n#### Exercises 16.8\n1.

Conversely, we leave it as an exercise15 to show that \\(\\hat{v}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\right)\\vec{v}\\) is a unit vector for any nonzero vector \\(\\vec{v}\\). In practice, if \\(\\vec{v}\\) is a unit vector we write it as \\(\\hat{v}\\) as opposed to \\(\\vec{v}\\) because we have reserved the '\\(\\hat{}\\)' notation for unit vectors. The process of multiplying a nonzero vector by the factor \\(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\) to produce a unit vector is called '**normalizing** the vector,' and the resulting vector \\(\\hat{v}\\) is called the 'unit vector in the **direction** of \\(\\vec{v}\\). The terminal points of unit vectors, when plotted in standard position, lie on the Unit Circle. (You should take the time to show this.) As a result, we visualize normalizing a nonzero vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) as shrinking16 its terminal point, when plotted in standard position, back to the Unit Circle.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nsatisfy this condition, so we pick14 the phase to be \\(\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Hence, the equation of motion is \\(x(t)=3\\sin\\left(2t+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). To find when the object passes through the equilibrium position we solve \\(x(t)=3\\sin\\left(2t+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). Going through the usual analysis we find \\(t=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since we are interested in the first time the object passes through the equilibrium position, we look for the smallest positive \\(t\\) value which in this case is \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx 0.78\\) seconds after the start of the motion. Common sense suggests that if we release the object below the equilibrium position, the object should be traveling upwards when it first passes through it. To check this answer, we graph one cycle of \\(x(t)\\). Since our applied domain in this situation is \\(t\\geq 0\\), and the period of \\(x(t)\\) is \\(T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}=\\frac{2\\pi}{2}=\\pi\\), we graph \\(x(t)\\) over the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\). Remembering that \\(x(t)>0\\) means the object is below the equilibrium position and \\(x(t)<0\\) means the object is above the equilibrium position, the fact our graph is crossing through the \\(t\\)-axis from positive \\(x\\) to negative \\(x\\) at \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) confirms our answer. Footnote 14: For confirmation, we note that \\(A\\omega\\cos(\\phi)=v_{0}\\), which in this case reduces to \\(6\\cos(\\phi)=0\\).\n2. The only difference between this problem and the previous problem is that we now release the object with an upward velocity of \\(8\\,\\frac{\\text{ft}}{s}\\). We still have \\(\\omega=2\\) and \\(x_{0}=3\\), but now we have \\(v_{0}=-8\\), the negative indicating the velocity is directed upwards. Here, we get \\(A=\\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+\\left(\\frac{v_{0}}{\\omega}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2} }=5\\). From \\(A\\sin(\\phi)=x_{0}\\), we get \\(5\\sin(\\phi)=3\\) which gives \\(\\sin(\\phi)=\\frac{3}{5}\\). From \\(A\\omega\\cos(\\phi)=v_{0}\\), we get \\(10\\cos(\\phi)=-8\\), or \\(\\cos(\\phi)=-\\frac{4}{5}\\). This means that \\(\\phi\\) is a Quadrant II angle which we can describe in terms of either arcsine or arccosine. Since \\(x(t)\\) is expressed in terms of sine, we choose to express \\(\\phi=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\). Hence, at most 5 feet above the equilibrium position. To find when this happens, we solve the equation \\(x(t)=5\\sin\\left(2t+\\left[\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right]\\right)=-5\\), the negative once again signifying that the object is _above_ the equilibrium position. Going through the usual machinations, we get \\(t=\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The smallest of these values occurs when \\(k=0\\), that is, \\(t=\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx 1.107\\) seconds after the start of the motion. To check our answer using the calculator, we graph \\(y=5\\sin\\left(2x+\\left[\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\right]\\right)\\) on a graphing utility and confirm the coordinates of the first relative minimum to be approximately \\((1.107,-5)\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\iint_{D}(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F})\\cdot{ \\bf N}\\,dS,\\]\nif \\(\\partial D\\) is oriented counter-clockwise relative to \\({\\bf N}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nNote how little has changed: \\({\\bf k}\\) becomes \\({\\bf N}\\), a unit normal to the surface (just as \\({\\bf k}\\) is a unit normal to the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\)-plane), and \\(dA\\) becomes \\(dS\\), since this is now a general surface integral.

Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\).

We make an inspired guess: might there be a solution of the form \\(e^{rt}\\)? This seems at least plausible, since in this case \\(\\ddot{y}\\), \\(\\dot{y}\\), and \\(y\\) all involve \\(e^{rt}\\).\n**470 Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nIf such a function is a solution then\n\\[\\eqalign{r^{2}e^{rt}-re^{rt}-2e^{rt}&=0\\cr e^{rt}(r^{2}-r-2)&=0\\cr(r^{2}-r-2)&=0 \\cr(r-2)(r+1)&=0,\\cr}\\]\nso \\(r\\) is \\(2\\) or \\(-1\\). Not only are \\(f=e^{2t}\\) and \\(g=e^{-t}\\) solutions, but notice that \\(y=Af+Bg\\) is also, for any constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{(Af+Bg)^{\\prime\\prime}-(Af+Bg)^{\\prime}-2(Af+Bg)&=Af^{\\prime\\prime}+ Bg^{\\prime\\prime}-Af^{\\prime}-Bg^{\\prime}-2Af-2Bg\\cr&=A(f^{\\prime\\prime}-f^{\\prime}-2f)+ B(g^{\\prime\\prime}-g^{\\prime}-2g)\\cr&=A(0)+B(0)=0.\\cr}\\]\nCan we find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) so that this is a solution to the initial value problem? Let's substitute:\n\\[5=y(0)=Af(0)+Bg(0)=Ae^{0}+Be^{0}=A+B\\]\nand\n\\[0=\\dot{y}(0)=Af^{\\prime}(0)+Bg^{\\prime}(0)=A2e^{0}+B(-1)e^{0}=2A-B.\\]\nSo we need to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that make both \\(5=A+B\\) and \\(0=2A-B\\) true. This is a simple set of simultaneous equations: solve \\(B=2A\\), substitute to get \\(5=A+2A=3A\\). Then \\(A=5/3\\) and \\(B=10/3\\), and the desired solution is \\((5/3)e^{2t}+(10/3)e^{-t}\\). You now see why the initial condition in this case included both \\(y(0)\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)\\): we needed two equations in the two unknowns \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\\(\\mathchar 1027\\relax\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThen as in the discussion, \\(h(t)=t^{-3}\\) and \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=t^{2}/t^{-3}=t^{5}\\), so \\(v(t)=t^{6}/6\\). We know that every solution to the equation looks like\n\\[v(t)t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{6}}{6}t^{-3}+At^{-3}=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+At^{-3}.\\]\nFinally we substitute to find \\(A\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}+A(1)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{6}+A\\] \\[A=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\]\nThe solution is then\n\\[y=\\frac{t^{3}}{6}+\\frac{1}{3}t^{-3}.\\]\n\\(\\Box\\)\nHere is an alternate method for finding a particular solution to the differential equation, using an **integrating factor**. In the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), we note that if we multiply through by a function \\(I(t)\\) to get \\(I(t)\\dot{y}+I(t)p(t)y=I(t)f(t)\\), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product rule:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(I(t)y)=I(t)\\dot{y}+I^{\\prime}(t)y.\\]\nNow if we could choose \\(I(t)\\) so that \\(I^{\\prime}(t)=I(t)p(t)\\), this would be exactly the left hand side of the differential equation. But this is just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution is \\(I(t)=e^{Q(t)}\\), where \\(Q(t)=\\int p\\,dt\\); note that \\(Q(t)=-P(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) appears in the variation of parameters method and \\(P^{\\prime}(t)=-p\\). Now the modified differential equation is\n\\[e^{-P(t)}\\dot{y}+e^{-P(t)}p(t)y =e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\] \\[\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-P(t)}y) =e^{-P(t)}f(t).\\]\nIntegrating both sides gives\n\\[e^{-P(t)}y =\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt\\] \\[y =e^{P(t)}\\int e^{-P(t)}f(t)\\,dt.\\]\nIf you look carefully, you will see that this is exactly the same solution we found by variation of parameters, because \\(e^{-P(t)}f(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\).\nSome people find it easier to remember how to use the integrating factor method than variation of parameters. Since ultimately they require the same calculation, you should use whichever of the two you find easier to recall. Using this method, the solution of the previous example would look just a bit different: Starting with \\(\\dot{y}+3y/t=t^{2}\\), we recall that the integrating factor is \\(e^{\\int 3/t}=e^{3\\ln t}=t^{3}\\). Then we multiply through by the integrating factor and solve:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 17.6 Second Order Linear Equations\nNow we consider second order equations of the form \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) constant. Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\n\n",

We know that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=\\sin(t)\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{ gives a {\\em counter-clockwise} parametrization of the Unit Circle with }t=0\\text{ corresponding to }(1,0)\\), so the first order of business is to reverse the orientation. Replacing \\(t\\) with \\(-t\\) gives \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(-t),\\,y=\\sin(-t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq-t<2\\pi\\right.\\), which simplifies9 to \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-2\\pi<t\\leq 0\\right.\\). This parametrization gives a clockwise orientation, but \\(t=0\\) still corresponds to the point \\((1,0)\\); the point \\((0,-1)\\) is reached when \\(t=-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Our strategy is to first get the parametrization to 'start' at the point \\((0,-1)\\) and then shift the parameter accordingly so the 'start' coincides with \\(t=0\\). We know that any interval of length \\(2\\pi\\) will parametrize the entire circle, so we keep the equations \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{, but start the parameter }t\\text{ at }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\text{, and find the upper bound by adding }2\\pi\\text{ so }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). The reader can verify that \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos(t),\\,y=-\\sin(t)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\text{ traces out the Unit Circle clockwise starting at the point }(0,-1)\\). We now shift the parameter by introducing a 'time delay' of \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) units by replacing every occurrence of \\(t\\) with \\(\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We get \\(\\left\\{x=\\cos\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right),\\,y=-\\sin\\left(t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\right)\\,\\text{ for }-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\leq t-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right.\\). This simplifies10 to \\(\\left\\{x=-\\sin(t),\\,y=-\\cos(t)\\,\\text{ for }0\\leq t<2\\pi\\text{, as required.}\\right.\\)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. To parametrize line segment which starts at \\((2,-3)\\) and ends at \\((1,5)\\), we make use of the formulas \\(x=x_{0}+(x_{1}-x_{0})t\\) and \\(y=y_{0}+(y_{1}-y_{0})t\\) for \\(0\\leq t\\leq 1\\). While these equations at first glance are quite a handful,8 they can be summarized as 'starting point \\(+\\) (displacement)\\(t\\)'. To find the equation for \\(x\\), we have that the line segment _starts_ at \\(x=2\\) and _ends_ at \\(x=1\\). This means the _displacement_ in the \\(x\\)-direction is \\((1-2)=-1\\). Hence, the equation for \\(x\\) is \\(x=2+(-1)t=2-t\\). For \\(y\\), we note that the line segment starts at \\(y=-3\\) and ends at \\(y=5\\). Hence, the displacement in the \\(y\\)-direction is \\((5-(-3))=8\\), so we get \\(y=-3+8t\\). Our final answer is \\(\\{x=2-t\\), \\(y=-3+8t\\) for \\(0\\leq t\\leq 1\\). To check, we can solve \\(x=2-t\\) for \\(t\\) to get \\(t=2-x\\). Substituting this into \\(y=-3+8t\\) gives \\(y=-3+8t=-3+8(2-x)\\), or \\(y=-8x+13\\). We know this is the graph of a line, so all we need to check is that it starts and stops at the correct points. When \\(t=0\\), \\(x=2-t=2\\), and when \\(t=1\\), \\(x=2-t=1\\). Plugging in \\(x=2\\) gives \\(y=-8(2)+13=-3\\), for an initial point of \\((2,-3)\\). Plugging in \\(x=1\\) gives \\(y=-8(1)+13=5\\) for an ending point of \\((1,5)\\), as required. Footnote 8: Compare and contrast this with Exercise 65 in Section 11.8.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n4. In order to use the formulas above to parametrize the circle \\(x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y=4\\), we first need to put it into the correct form. After completing the squares, we get \\((x+1)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=9\\), or \\(\\frac{(x+1)^{2}}{9}+\\frac{(y-2)^{2}}{9}=1\\). Once again, the formulas \\(x=h+a\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=k+b\\sin(t)\\) can be a challenge to memorize, but they come from the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\). In the equation \\(\\frac{(x+1)^{2}}{9}+\\frac{(y-2)^{2}}{9}=1\\), we identify \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{x+1}{3}\\) and \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{y-2}{3}\\). Rearranging these last two equations, we get \\(x=-1+3\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=2+3\\sin(t)\\). In order to complete one revolution around the circle, we let \\(t\\) range through the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\). We get as our final answer \\(\\{x=-1+3\\cos(t),\\,y=2+3\\sin(t)\\,\\) for \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\). To check our answer, we could eliminate the parameter by solving \\(x=-1+3\\cos(t)\\) for \\(\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=2+3\\sin(t)\\) for \\(\\sin(t)\\), invoking a Pythagorean Identity, and then manipulating the resulting equation in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the original equation \\(x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y=4\\). Instead, we opt for a more direct approach. We substitute \\(x=-1+3\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=2+3\\sin(t)\\) into the equation \\(x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y=4\\) and show that the latter is satisfied for all \\(t\\) such that \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y&=&4\\\\ (-1+3\\cos(t))^{2}+2(-1+3\\cos(t))+(2+3\\sin(t))^{2}-4(2+3\\sin(t))&\\stackrel{{ ?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 1-6\\cos(t)+9\\cos^{2}(t)-2+6\\cos(t)+4+12\\sin(t)+9\\sin^{2}(t)-8-12\\sin(t)& \\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 9\\cos^{2}(t)+9\\sin^{2}(t)-5&\\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 9\\left(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)\\right)-5&\\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 9\\left(1\\right)-5&\\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 4&\\stackrel{{\\not}}{{=}}&4\\end{array}\\] Now that we know the parametric equations give us points on the circle, we can go through the usual analysis as demonstrated in Example 11.10.2 to show that the entire circle is covered as \\(t\\) ranges through the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\n\n",

Under reasonable conditions on \\(\\phi\\), we know the solution exists, represented by a curve in the \\(t\\)-\\(y\\) plane; call this solution \\(f(t)\\). The point \\((t_{0},y_{0})\\) is of course on this curve. We also know the slope of the curve at this point, namely \\(\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\). If we follow the tangent line for a brief distance, we arrive at a point that should be almost on the graph of \\(f(t)\\), namely \\((t_{0}+\\Delta t,y_{0}+\\phi(t_{0},y_{0})\\Delta t)\\); call this point \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\).

So we can compute a new point, \\((t_{2},y_{2})=(t_{1}+\\Delta t,y_{1}+\\phi(t_{1},y_{1})\\Delta t)\\) that is a little farther along, still close to the graph of \\(f(t)\\) but probably not quite so close as \\((t_{1},y_{1})\\). We can continue in this way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have an approximation \\((t_{n},y_{n})\\) for whatever time \\(t_{n}\\) we need. At each step we do essentially the same calculation, namely\n\\[(t_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(t_{i}+\\Delta t,y_{i}+\\phi(t_{i},y_{i})\\Delta t).\\]\nWe expect that smaller time steps \\(\\Delta t\\) will give better approximations, but of course it will require more work to compute to a specified time. It is possible to compute a guaranteed\nupper bound on how far off the approximation might be, that is, how far \\(y_{n}\\) is from \\(f(t_{n})\\). Suffice it to say that the bound is not particularly good and that there are other more complicated approximation techniques that do better.\n**EXAMPLE 17.4.3** Let us compute an approximation to the solution for \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\), \\(y(0)=0\\), when \\(t=1\\). We will use \\(\\Delta t=0.2\\), which is easy to do even by hand, though we should not expect the resulting approximation to be very good. We get\n\\[\\eqalign{(t_{1},y_{1})&=(0+0.2,0+(0-0^{2})0.2)=(0.2,0)\\cr(t_{2},y_{2})&=(0.2+0. 2,0+(0.2-0^{2})0.2)=(0.4,0.04)\\cr(t_{3},y_{3})&=(0.6,0.04+(0.4-0.04^{2})0.2)=( 0.6,0.11968)\\cr(t_{4},y_{4})&=(0.8,0.11968+(0.6-0.11968^{2})0.2)=(0.8,0.2368153 3952)\\cr(t_{5},y_{5})&=(1.0,0.23681533952+(0.6-0.23681533952^{2})0.2)=(1.0,0.38 5599038513605)\\cr}\\]\nSo \\(y(1)\\approx 0.3856\\). As it turns out, this is not accurate to even one decimal place. Figure 17.4.1 shows these points connected by line segments (the lower curve) compared to a solution obtained by a much better approximation technique. Note that the shape is approximately correct even though the end points are quite far apart.\n**Figure 17.4.1** Approximating a solution to \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\), \\(y(0)=0\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\nNot all differential equations that are important in practice can be solved exactly, so techniques have been developed to approximate solutions.

Find them and give a rough sketch of \\(f\\) with its horizontal asymptotes. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n3. To find the \\(x\\)-intercept we set \\(y=g(x)=0\\). Using the factored form of \\(g(x)\\) above, we find the zeros to be the solutions of \\((2x-5)(x+1)=0\\). We obtain \\(x=\\frac{5}{2}\\) and \\(x=-1\\). Since both of these numbers are in the domain of \\(g\\), we have two \\(x\\)-intercepts, \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{2},0\\right)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept, we set \\(x=0\\) and find \\(y=g(0)=\\frac{5}{6}\\), so our \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(\\left(0,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\).\n4. Since \\(g(x)\\) was given to us in lowest terms, we have, once again by Theorem 4.1 vertical asymptotes \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=3\\). Keeping in mind \\(g(x)=\\frac{(2x-5)(x+1)}{(x-3)(x+2)}\\), we proceed to our analysis near each of these values. * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to-2\\):_ As \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), we imagine substituting a number a little bit less than \\(-2\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(-9)(-1)}{(-5)(\\text{very small }(-))}\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\]\nso as \\(x\\to-2^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). On the flip side, as \\(x\\to-2^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{9}{\\text{very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). * _The behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) as \\(x\\to 3\\):_ As \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), we imagine plugging in a number just shy of \\(3\\). We have \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{(1)(4)}{(\\text{ very small }(-))(5)}\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{ very small }(-)}\\approx\\text{very big }(-)\\] Hence, as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), we get \\[g(x)\\approx\\frac{4}{\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx\\text{very big }(+)\\] so \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\). Graphically, we have (again, without labels on the \\(y\\)-axis) 5. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator of \\(g(x)\\) are the same, we know from Theorem 4.2 that we can find the horizontal asymptote of the graph of \\(g\\) by taking the ratio of the leading terms coefficients, \\(y=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\). However, if we take the time to do a more detailed analysis, we will be able to reveal some 'hidden' behavior which would be lost otherwise.11 As in the discussion following Theorem 4.2, we use the result of the long division \\(\\left(2x^{2}-3x-5\\right)\\div\\left(x^{2}-x-6\\right)\\) to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-3x-5}{x^{2}-x-6}\\) as \\(g(x)=2-\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}.\\) We focus our attention on the term \\(\\frac{x-7}{x^{2}-x-6}\\). Footnote 11: That is, if you use a calculator to graph. Once again, Calculus is the ultimate graphing power tool.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n10 & \\(\\approx 485.48\\) \\\\ \\hline\n100 & \\(\\approx 498.50\\) \\\\ \\hline\n1000 & \\(\\approx 499.85\\) \\\\ \\hline\n10000 & \\(\\approx 499.98\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\nThe table suggests that as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(N(t)\\to 500\\).

This means as time goes by, only a total of 500 students will have ever had the flu.\nWe close this section with a discussion of the _third_ (and final!) kind of asymptote which can be associated with the graphs of rational functions. Let us return to the function \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-4}{x+1}\\) in Example 4.1.4. Performing long division,12 we get \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-4}{x+1}=x-1-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\). Since the term \\(\\frac{3}{x+1}\\to 0\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), it stands to reason that as \\(x\\) becomes unbounded, the function values \\(g(x)=x-1-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\approx x-1\\). Geometrically, this means that the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\) should resemble the line \\(y=x-1\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). We see this play out both numerically and graphically below.\nFootnote 12: See the remarks following Theorem 4.2.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline x&g(x)&x-1\\\\ \\hline-10&\\approx-10.6667&-11\\\\ \\hline-100&\\approx-100.9697&-101\\\\ \\hline-1000&\\approx-1000.9970&-1001\\\\ \\hline-10000&\\approx-10000.9997&-10001\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline x&g(x)&x-1\\\\ \\hline 10&\\approx 8.7273&9\\\\ \\hline 100&\\approx 98.9703&99\\\\ \\hline 1000&\\approx 998.9970&999\\\\ \\hline 10000&\\approx 9998.9997&9999\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{|r||c|c|}\\hline y=g(x)&\\text{and }y=x-1\\\\ \\text{as }x\\to-\\infty&\\text{as }x\\to\\infty\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nThe way we symbolize the relationship between the end behavior of \\(y=g(x)\\) with that of the line \\(y=x-1\\) is to write 'as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\), \\(g(x)\\to x-1\\).' In this case, we say the line \\(y=x-1\\) is a **slant asymptote**13 to the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). Informally, the graph of a rational function has a slant asymptote if, as \\(x\\to\\infty\\) or as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the graph resembles a non-horizontal, or 'slanted' line.

Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\).

In order to use the formulas above to parametrize the circle \\(x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y=4\\), we first need to put it into the correct form. After completing the squares, we get \\((x+1)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=9\\), or \\(\\frac{(x+1)^{2}}{9}+\\frac{(y-2)^{2}}{9}=1\\). Once again, the formulas \\(x=h+a\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=k+b\\sin(t)\\) can be a challenge to memorize, but they come from the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\). In the equation \\(\\frac{(x+1)^{2}}{9}+\\frac{(y-2)^{2}}{9}=1\\), we identify \\(\\cos(t)=\\frac{x+1}{3}\\) and \\(\\sin(t)=\\frac{y-2}{3}\\). Rearranging these last two equations, we get \\(x=-1+3\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=2+3\\sin(t)\\). In order to complete one revolution around the circle, we let \\(t\\) range through the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\). We get as our final answer \\(\\{x=-1+3\\cos(t),\\,y=2+3\\sin(t)\\,\\) for \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\). To check our answer, we could eliminate the parameter by solving \\(x=-1+3\\cos(t)\\) for \\(\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=2+3\\sin(t)\\) for \\(\\sin(t)\\), invoking a Pythagorean Identity, and then manipulating the resulting equation in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the original equation \\(x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y=4\\). Instead, we opt for a more direct approach. We substitute \\(x=-1+3\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=2+3\\sin(t)\\) into the equation \\(x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y=4\\) and show that the latter is satisfied for all \\(t\\) such that \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}x^{2}+2x+y^{2}-4y&=&4\\\\ (-1+3\\cos(t))^{2}+2(-1+3\\cos(t))+(2+3\\sin(t))^{2}-4(2+3\\sin(t))&\\stackrel{{ ?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 1-6\\cos(t)+9\\cos^{2}(t)-2+6\\cos(t)+4+12\\sin(t)+9\\sin^{2}(t)-8-12\\sin(t)& \\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 9\\cos^{2}(t)+9\\sin^{2}(t)-5&\\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 9\\left(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)\\right)-5&\\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 9\\left(1\\right)-5&\\stackrel{{?}}{{=}}&4\\\\ 4&\\stackrel{{\\not}}{{=}}&4\\end{array}\\] Now that we know the parametric equations give us points on the circle, we can go through the usual analysis as demonstrated in Example 11.10.2 to show that the entire circle is covered as \\(t\\) ranges through the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n5. In the equation \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{4}+\\frac{y^{2}}{9}=1\\), we can either use the formulas above or think back to the Pythagorean Identity to get \\(x=2\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=3\\sin(t)\\). The normal range on the parameter in this case is \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\), but since we are interested in only the left half of the ellipse, we restrict \\(t\\) to the values which correspond to Quadrant II and Quadrant III angles, namely \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\leq t\\leq\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\). Our final answer is \\(\\left\\{x=2\\cos(t),\\,y=3\\sin(t)\\,\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\leq t\\leq\\frac {3\\pi}{2}\\right.\\). Substituting \\(x=2\\cos(t)\\) and \\(y=3\\sin(t)\\) into \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{4}+\\frac{y^{2}}{9}=1\\) gives \\(\\frac{4\\cos^{2}(t)}{4}+\\frac{9\\sin^{2}(t)}{9}=1\\), which reduces to the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\). This proves that the points generated by the parametric equations \\(\\left\\{x=2\\cos(t),\\,y=3\\sin(t)\\,\\,\\text{lie on the ellipse }\\frac{x^{2}}{4}+\\frac{y^{2}}{9}=1\\right.\\). Employing the techniques demonstrated in Example 11.10.2, we find that the restriction \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\leq t\\leq\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) generates the left half of the ellipse, as required.\n\n\n",

In this case, we say the **maximum12** of \\(f\\) is \\(5.5\\); similarly, the **minimum13** of \\(f\\) is \\(-8\\).\nFootnote 12: ‘Maxima’ is the plural of ‘maximum’ and ‘mimima’ is the plural of ‘minimum’. ‘Extrema’ is the plural of ‘extremum’ which combines maximum and minimum.\nWe formalize these concepts in the following definitions.\n**Definition 1.11**.: Suppose \\(f\\) is a function with \\(f(a)=b\\).\n* We say \\(f\\) has a **local maximum** at the point \\((a,b)\\) if and only if there is an open interval \\(I\\) containing \\(a\\) for which \\(f(a)\\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\(I\\).

Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\). So the question becomes: what happens between \\(-2\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\)? Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than \\(4\\cdot 4\\) which is clearly larger than \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), this settles the question.)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIt's now time to \"thoroughly vet the pathologies induced\" by the precise definitions of local maximum and local minimum. We'll do this by providing you and your classmates a series of Exercises to discuss. You will need to refer back to Definition 1.10 (Increasing, Decreasing and Constant) and Definition 1.11 (Maximum and Minimum) during the discussion.\n1. Consider the graph of the function \\(f\\) given below.\n1. Show that \\(f\\) has a local maximum but not a local minimum at the point \\((-1,1)\\). 2. Show that \\(f\\) has a local minimum but not a local maximum at the point \\((1,1)\\). 3. Show that \\(f\\) has a local maximum AND a local minimum at the point \\((0,1)\\). 4. Show that \\(f\\) is constant on the interval \\([-1,1]\\) and thus has both a local maximum AND a local minimum at every point \\((x,f(x))\\) where \\(-1<x<1\\).\n100. Using Example 1.6.4 as a guide, show that the function \\(g\\) whose graph is given below does not have a local maximum at \\((-3,5)\\) nor does it have a local minimum at \\((3,-3)\\). Find its extrema, both local and absolute. What's unique about the point \\((0,-4)\\) on this graph? Also find the intervals on which \\(g\\) is increasing and those on which \\(g\\) is decreasing.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nFirst note that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=-2x+4=0\\) when \\(x=2\\). But \\(x=2\\) is not in the interval, so we don't use it. Thus the only two points to be checked are the endpoints; \\(f(-1)=-8\\) and \\(f(1)=0\\). So the largest value of \\(f(x)\\) on \\([-1,1]\\) is \\(f(1)=0\\).\n**Example 6.1.5**  Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\(f(x)=7+|x-2|\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(4\\) inclusive. The derivative \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is never zero, but \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=2\\), so we compute \\(f(2)=7\\). Checking the end points we get \\(f(1)=8\\) and \\(f(4)=9\\). The smallest of these numbers is \\(f(2)=7\\), which is, therefore, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) on the interval \\(1\\leq x\\leq 4\\), and the maximum is \\(f(4)=9\\).\n**Example 6.1.6**  Find all local maxima and minima for \\(f(x)=x^{3}-x\\), and determine whether there is a global maximum or minimum on the open interval \\((-2,2)\\). In example 5.1.2 we found a local maximum at \\((-\\sqrt{3}/3,2\\sqrt{3}/9)\\) and a local minimum at \\((\\sqrt{3}/3,-2\\sqrt{3}/9)\\).

Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\). So the question becomes: what happens between \\(-2\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\)? Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than \\(4\\cdot 4\\) which is clearly larger than \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), this settles the question.)\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\nPerhaps remarkably, this special case is all we need to prove the more general one as well.\n\n\n",

This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation. In some complex calculations involving\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\n\n",

Solving \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=0\\) for \\(x\\) gives us \\(x=\\pm 10\\). We are interested only in \\(x>0\\), so only the value \\(x=10\\) is of interest. Since \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) is defined everywhere on the interval \\((0,\\infty)\\), there are no more critical values, and there are no endpoints. Is there a local maximum, minimum, or neither at \\(x=10\\)? The second derivative is \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=400/x^{3}\\), and \\(f^{\\prime\\prime}(10)>0\\), so there is a local minimum. Since there is only one critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the rectangle with smallest perimeter is the \\(10\\times 10\\) square. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 6.1.8**: You want to sell a certain number \\(n\\) of items in order to maximize your profit.

This vector function traces out precisely \\(y=\\ln x\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle 1,1/t,0\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+1/t^{2}}\\) and the desired length is\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{t^{2}}}\\,dt=2-\\sqrt{2}+\\ln(\\sqrt{2}+1)- \\frac{1}{2}\\ln 3.\\]\n(This integral is a bit tricky, but requires only methods we have learned.) \\(\\Box\\)\nNotice that there is nothing special about \\(y=\\ln x\\), except that the resulting integral can be computed. In general, given any \\(y=f(x)\\), we can think of this as the vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle t,f(t),0\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle 1,f^{\\prime}(t),0\\rangle\\) and \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime})^{2}}\\). The length of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is thus\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}\\sqrt{1+(f^{\\prime}(x))^{2}}\\,dx.\\]\nUnfortunately, such integrals are often impossible to do exactly and must be approximated.\nOne useful application of arc length is the **arc length parameterization**. A vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) gives the position of a point in terms of the parameter \\(t\\), which is often time, but need not be. Suppose \\(s\\) is the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use \\(s\\) for the variable, we get \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), the position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has traveled.\n\n\n",

The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\).

This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1.

The exponents on each term must add to \\(5\\) and if the exponent on \\(x\\) is \\(3\\), the exponent on \\(y\\) must be \\(2\\). Plucking out the term \\(j=2\\), we get \\[\\binom{5}{2}(2x)^{5-2}y^{2}=10(2x)^{3}y^{2}=80x^{3}y^{2}\\]\nWe close this section with Pascal's Triangle, named in honor of the mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal's Triangle is obtained by arranging the binomial coefficients in the triangular fashion below.\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 3\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nSince \\(\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}=1\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ n\\end{pmatrix}=1\\) for all whole numbers \\(n\\), we get that each row of Pascal's Triangle begins and ends with 1. To generate the numbers in the middle of the rows (from the third row onwards), we take advantage of the additive relationship expressed in Theorem 9.3. For instance, \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\) and so forth. This relationship is indicated by the arrows in the array above. With these two facts in hand, we can quickly generate Pascal's Triangle. We start with the first two rows, 1 and 1 1. From that point on, each successive row begins and ends with 1 and the middle numbers are generated using Theorem 9.3. Below we attempt to demonstrate this building process to generate the first five rows of Pascal's Triangle.\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&x-y+z&=&5\\\\ (E2)&-2y+z&=&6\\\\ (E3)&2y-2z&=&-12\\end{array}\\right.\\quad\\xrightarrow{\\text{Replace $E2$ with $-\\frac{1}{2}E2$}}\\quad\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ cccc}(E1)&x-y+z&=&5\\\\ (E2)&y-\\frac{1}{2}z&=&-3\\\\ (E3)&2y-2z&=&-12\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nTo eliminate the \\(y\\) in \\(E3\\), we add \\(-2E2\\) to it.\n\\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&x-y+z&=&5\\\\ (E2)&y-\\frac{1}{2}z&=&-3\\\\ (E3)&2y-2z&=&-12\\end{array}\\right.\\quad\\xrightarrow{\\text{Replace $E3$ with $-2E2+E3$}}\\quad\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ cccc}(E1)&x-y+z&=&5\\\\ (E2)&y-\\frac{1}{2}z&=&-3\\\\ (E3)&-z&=&-6\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nFinally, we apply the second move from Theorem 8.1 one last time and multiply \\(E3\\) by \\(-1\\) to satisfy the conditions of Definition 8.3 for the variable \\(z\\).\n\\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&x-y+z&=&5\\\\ (E2)&y-\\frac{1}{2}z&=&-3\\\\ (E3)&-z&=&-6\\end{array}\\right.\\quad\\xrightarrow{\\text{Replace $E3$ with $-1E3$}}\\quad\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ cccc}(E1)&x-y+z&=&5\\\\ (E2)&y-\\frac{1}{2}z&=&-3\\\\ (E3)&z&=&6\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nNow we proceed to substitute. Plugging in \\(z=6\\) into \\(E2\\) gives \\(y-3=-3\\) so that \\(y=0\\). With \\(y=0\\) and \\(z=6\\), \\(E1\\) becomes \\(x-0+6=5\\), or \\(x=-1\\). Our solution is \\((-1,0,6)\\). We leave it to the reader to check that substituting the respective values for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into the original system results in three identities. Since we have found a solution, the system is consistent; since there are no free variables, it is independent.\n2. Proceeding as we did in \\(1\\), our first step is to get an equation with \\(x\\) in the \\(E1\\) position with \\(1\\) as its coefficient.

This means that these two different linear equations are, in fact, equivalent. In other words, if an ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(2x-4y=6\\), it _automatically_ satisfies the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\). One way to describe the solution set to this system is to use the roster method2 and write \\(\\{(x,y)\\,|\\,2x-4y=6\\}\\). While this is correct (and corresponds exactly to what's happening graphically, as we shall see shortly), we take this opportunity to introduce the notion of a **parametric solution to a system**. Our first step is to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for one of the variables, say \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\). For each value of \\(x\\), the formula \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\) determines the corresponding \\(y\\)-value of a solution. Since we have no restriction on \\(x\\), it is called a **free variable**. We let \\(x=t\\), a so-called 'parameter', and get \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\).

For example, \\(t=0\\) gives us the solution \\(\\big{(}0,-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\); \\(t=117\\) gives us \\((117,57)\\), and while we can readily check each of these particular solutions satisfy both equations, the question is how do we check our general answer algebraically? Same as always. We claim that for any real number \\(t\\), the pair \\(\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\) satisfies both equations. Substituting \\(x=t\\) and \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\) into \\(2x-4y=6\\) gives \\(2t-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=6\\). Simplifying, we get \\(2t-2t+6=6\\), which is always true. Similarly, when we make these substitutions in the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\), we get \\(3t-6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=9\\) which reduces to \\(3t-3t+9=9\\), so it checks out, too. Geometrically, \\(2x-4y=6\\) and \\(3x-6y=9\\) are the same line, which means that they intersect at every point on their graphs. The reader is encouraged to think about how our parametric solution says exactly that.\nFootnote 2: See Section 1.2 for a review of this.\nFootnote 3: Note that we could have just as easily chosen to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for \\(x\\) to obtain \\(x=2y+3\\).

No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\).

Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense.

We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense).

What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\nThe rectangles this time are above the curve, that is, each rectangle completely contains the corresponding area under the curve. This means that\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}>\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1 \\over x}\\,dx=\\ln x\\Big{|}_{1}^{n+1}=\\ln(n+1).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets bigger, \\(\\ln(n+1)\\) goes to infinity, so the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) must also go to infinity, so the harmonic series diverges. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 11.3.2** Graph of \\(y=1/x\\) with rectangles.\nThe important fact that clinches this example is that\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty,\\]\nwhich we can rewrite as\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty.\\]\nSo these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the **integral test**, which we state as a theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n\\[\\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\]\nboth the numerator and denominator approach zero. Typically this difficulty can be resolved when \\(f\\) is a \"nice\" function and we are trying to compute a derivative. Occasionally such limits are interesting for other reasons, and the limit of a fraction in which both numerator and denominator approach zero can be difficult to analyze. Now that we have the derivative available, there is another technique that can sometimes be helpful in such circumstances.\nBefore we introduce the technique, we will also expand our concept of limit, in two ways. When the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) does not exist, it may be useful to note in what way it does not exist. We have already talked about one such case: one-sided limits. Another case is when \"\\(f\\) goes to infinity\". We also will occasionally want to know what happens to \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) \"goes to infinity\".\n**Example 4.10.1**: What happens to \\(1/x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(0\\)? From the right, \\(1/x\\) gets bigger and bigger, or goes to infinity. From the left it goes to negative infinity. \\(\\sqcap\\)__\n**Example 4.10.2**: What happens to the function \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity? It seems clear that as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger, \\(1/x\\) gets closer and closer to zero, so \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) should be getting closer and closer to \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)__\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here.

To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual.

By the squeeze theorem, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x=1\\) as well.\nBefore we can complete the calculation of the derivative of the sine, we need one other limit:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}.\\]\nThis limit is just as hard as \\(\\sin x/x\\), but closely related to it, so that we don't have to do a similar calculation; instead we can do a bit of tricky algebra.\n\\[\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}=\\frac{\\cos x-1}{x}\\frac{\\cos x+1}{\\cos x+1}=\\frac{\\cos^{2} x-1}{x(\\cos x+1)}=\\frac{-\\sin^{2}x}{x(\\cos x+1)}=-\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\frac{ \\sin x}{\\cos x+1}.\\]\nTo compute the desired limit it is sufficient to compute the limits of the two final fractions, as \\(x\\) goes to 0.

To find the domain of \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-\\cot(x)}\\), we first note that, due to the presence of the \\(\\cot(x)\\) term, \\(x\\neq\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Next, we recall that for the square root to be defined, we need \\(1-\\cot(x)\\geq 0\\). Unlike the inequalities we solved in Example 10.7.3, we are not restricted here to a given interval. Our strategy is to solve this inequality over \\((0,\\pi)\\) (the same interval which generates a fundamental cycle of cotangent) and then add integer multiples of the period, in this case, \\(\\pi\\). We let \\(g(x)=1-\\cot(x)\\) and set about making a sign diagram for \\(g\\) over the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) to find where \\(g(x)\\geq 0\\). We note that \\(g\\) is undefined for \\(x=\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\), in particular, at the endpoints of our interval \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\). Next, we look for the zeros of \\(g\\). Solving \\(g(x)=0\\), we get \\(\\cot(x)=1\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\) and only one of these, \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), lies in \\((0,\\pi)\\). Choosing the test values \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we get \\(g\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)=1-\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(g\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\). We find \\(g(x)\\geq 0\\) on \\(\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\pi\\right)\\). Adding multiples of the period we get our solution to consist of the intervals \\(\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k,\\pi+\\pi k\\right)=\\left[\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{4},(k+1)\\pi\\right]\\). Using extended interval notation, we express our final answer as \\[\\bigcup_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left[\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{4},(k+1)\\pi\\right)\\]\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* To solve \\(\\cos(u)=c\\) or \\(\\sin(u)=c\\) for \\(-1\\leq c\\leq 1\\), first solve for \\(u\\) in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and add integer multiples of the period \\(2\\pi\\). If \\(c<-1\\) or of \\(c>1\\), there are no real solutions.\n* To solve \\(\\sec(u)=c\\) or \\(\\csc(u)=c\\) for \\(c\\leq-1\\) or \\(c\\geq 1\\), convert to cosine or sine, respectively, and solve as above. If \\(-1<c<1\\), there are no real solutions.\n* To solve \\(\\tan(u)=c\\) for any real number \\(c\\), first solve for \\(u\\) in the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) and add integer multiples of the period \\(\\pi\\).\n* To solve \\(\\cot(u)=c\\) for \\(c\\neq 0\\), convert to tangent and solve as above. If \\(c=0\\), the solution to \\(\\cot(u)=0\\) is \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).\nUsing the above guidelines, we can comfortably solve \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) and find the solution \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). How do we solve something like \\(\\sin(3x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\)? Since this equation has the _form_\\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we know the solutions take the form \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of sine here is \\(3x\\), we have \\(3x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(3x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve for \\(x\\), we divide both sides2 of these equations by 3, and obtain \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{18}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{18}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}k\\) for integers \\(k\\). This is the technique employed in the example below.\nFootnote 2: Don’t forget to divide the \\(2\\pi k\\) by 3 as well!\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom these data, it clearly appears as if the period of \\(\\cot(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), and we leave it to the reader to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with quarter marks: \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\pi\\). A more complete graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) is below, along with the fundamental cycle highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) as read from the graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.\nThe properties of the tangent and cotangent functions are summarized below. As with Theorem 10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.\n**Theorem 10.25**. **Properties of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions**\n* The function \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\)\n\n\n",

As we have seen, sometimes changing from rectangular coordinates to another coordinate system is helpful, and this too changes the variables. This is certainly a more complicated change, since instead of changing one variable for another we change an entire suite of variables, but as it turns out it is really very similar to the kinds of change of variables we already know as substitution.\nLet's examine the single variable case again, from a slightly different perspective than we have previously used. Suppose we start with the problem\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}x^{2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx;\\]\nthis computes the area in the left graph of figure 15.7.1. We use the substitution \\(x=\\sin u\\) to transform the function from \\(x^{2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) to \\(\\sin^{2}u\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}u}\\), and we also convert \\(dx\\) to \\(\\cos u\\,du\\). Finally, we convert the limits 0 and 1 to 0 and \\(\\pi/2\\). This transforms the integral:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{1}x^{2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx=\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\sin^{2}u\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}u }\\cos u\\,du.\\]\nWe want to notice that there are three different conversions: the main function, the differential \\(dx\\), and the interval of integration. The function is converted to \\(\\sin^{2}u\\sqrt{1-\\sin^{2}u}\\)\nFigure 15.7.1: Single change of variable.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nRoughly speaking, the first integral adds up the flow across the boundary of the region, from inside to out, and the second sums the divergence (tendency to spread) at each point in the interior. The theorem roughly says that the sum of the \"microscopic\" spreads is the same as the total spread across the boundary and out of the region.\n#### Exercises 16.5\n1.

In the cardioid example, we considered only the range \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi\\), and already there was a duplicate: \\((2,0)\\) and \\((2,2\\pi)\\) are the same point. Indeed, every value of \\(\\theta\\) outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\) duplicates a point on the curve \\(r=1+\\cos\\theta\\) when \\(0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi\\). We can even make sense of polar coordinates like \\((-2,\\pi/4)\\): go to the direction \\(\\pi/4\\) and then move a distance \\(2\\) in the opposite direction; see figure 10.1.3. As usual, a negative angle \\(\\theta\\) means an angle measured clockwise from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. The point in figure 10.1.3 also has coordinates \\((2,5\\pi/4)\\) and \\((2,-3\\pi/4)\\).\nThe relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates is quite easy to understand. The point with polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\) has rectangular coordinates \\(x=r\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(y=r\\sin\\theta\\); this follows immediately from the definition of the sine and cosine functions. Using figure 10.1.3 as an example, the point shown has rectangular coordinates\n### Polar Coordinates\nThe point \\((-2,\\pi/4)=(2,5\\pi/4)=(2,-3\\pi/4)\\) in polar coordinates. We merely substitute: \\(r\\sin\\theta=3r\\cos\\theta+2\\), or \\(r=\\frac{2}{\\sin\\theta-3\\cos\\theta}\\).\n**Example 10.1.4**: Find the equation of the circle \\((x-1/2)^{2}+y^{2}=1/4\\) in polar coordinates. Again substituting: \\((r\\cos\\theta-1/2)^{2}+r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta=1/4\\). A bit of algebra turns this into \\(r=\\cos(t)\\). You should try plotting a few \\((r,\\theta)\\) values to convince yourself that this makes sense.\n**Example 10.1.5**: Graph the polar equation \\(r=\\theta\\). Here the distance from the origin exactly matches the angle, so a bit of thought makes it clear that when \\(\\theta\\geq 0\\) we get the spiral of Archimedes in figure 10.1.4. When \\(\\theta<0\\), \\(r\\) is also negative, and so the full graph is the right hand picture in the figure.\nConverting polar equations to rectangular equations can be somewhat trickier, and graphing polar equations directly is also not always easy.\nFigure 10.1.4: The spiral of Archimedes and the full graph of \\(r=\\theta\\).\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n* Find the area of \\(z=x^{2}+y^{2}\\) that lies below \\(z=1\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) that lies below \\(z=2\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the portion of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies in the first octant. \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the portion of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies above \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq b^{2}\\), \\(b\\leq a\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=x^{2}-y^{2}\\) that lies inside \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(z=xy\\) that lies inside \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies above the interior of the circle given in polar coordinates by \\(r=a\\cos\\theta\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the cone \\(z=k\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) that lies above the interior of the circle given in polar coordinates by \\(r=a\\cos\\theta\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the plane \\(z=ax+by+c\\) that lies over a region \\(D\\) with area \\(A\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the cone \\(z=k\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) that lies over a region \\(D\\) with area \\(A\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the area of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}\\) that lies inside the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* The surface \\(f(x,y)\\) can be represented with the vector function \\(\\langle x,y,f(x,y)\\rangle\\). Set up the surface area integral using this vector function and compare to the integral of section 15.4.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Solution.** We have \\(r=3\\) which gives the equations \\(\\{x=3(t-\\sin(t)),\\,y=3(1-\\cos(t))\\,\\) for \\(t\\geq 0\\). (Here we have returned to the convention of using \\(t\\) as the parameter.) Sketching the cycloid by hand is a wonderful exercise in Calculus, but for the purposes of this book, we use a graphing utility. Using a calculator to graph parametric equations is very similar to graphing polar equations on a calculator.13 Ensuring that the calculator is in 'Parametric Mode' and 'radian mode' we enter the equations and advance to the 'Window' screen.\nFootnote 13: See page 959 in Section 11.5.\nAs always, the challenge is to determine appropriate bounds on the parameter, \\(t\\), as well as for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We know that one full revolution of the circle occurs over the interval \\(0\\leq t<2\\pi\\), so\nit seems reasonable to keep these as our bounds on \\(t\\). The 'Tstep' seems reasonably small - too large a value here can lead to incorrect graphs.14 We know from our derivation of the equations of the cycloid that the center of the generating circle has coordinates \\((r\\theta,r)\\), or in this case, \\((3t,3)\\). Since \\(t\\) ranges between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\), we set \\(x\\) to range between \\(0\\) and \\(6\\pi\\). The values of \\(y\\) go from the bottom of the circle to the top, so \\(y\\) ranges between \\(0\\) and \\(6\\).\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n* An object occupies the volume of the pyramid with corners at \\((1,1,0)\\), \\((1,-1,0)\\), \\((-1,-1,0)\\), \\((-1,1,0)\\), and \\((0,0,2)\\) and has density \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\) at \\((x,y,z)\\).

To set up integrals in polar coordinates, we had to understand the shape and area of a typical small region into which the region of integration was divided. We need to do the same thing here, for three dimensional regions.\n**408 Chapter 15 Multiple Integration**\nThe cylindrical coordinate system is the simplest, since it is just the polar coordinate system plus a \\(z\\) coordinate. A typical small unit of volume is the shape shown in figure 15.2.1 \"fattened up\" in the \\(z\\) direction, so its volume is \\(r\\Delta r\\Delta\\theta\\Delta z\\), or in the limit, \\(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz\\).\n**EXAMPLE 15.6.1** Find the volume under \\(z=\\sqrt{4-r^{2}}\\) above the quarter circle inside \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\) in the first quadrant.\n\n\n",

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\).

Our goal is to express the function \\(F\\) as \\(F=g\\circ f\\) for functions \\(g\\) and \\(f\\). From Definition 5.1, we know \\(F(x)=g(f(x))\\), and we can think of \\(f(x)\\) as being the 'inside' function and \\(g\\) as being the 'outside' function. Looking at \\(F(x)=|3x-1|\\) from an 'inside versus outside' perspective, we can think of \\(3x-1\\) being inside the absolute value symbols. Taking this cue, we define \\(f(x)=3x-1\\). At this point, we have \\(F(x)=|f(x)|\\). What is the outside function? The function which takes the absolute value of its input, \\(g(x)=|x|\\). Sure enough, \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=|f(x)|=|3x-1|=F(x)\\), so we are done.\n2. We attack deconstructing \\(G\\) from an operational approach. Given an input \\(x\\), the first step is to square \\(x\\), then add \\(1\\), then divide the result into \\(2\\). We will assign each of these steps a function so as to write \\(G\\) as a composite of three functions: \\(f\\), \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). Our first function, \\(f\\), is the function that squares its input, \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). The next function is the function that adds \\(1\\) to its input, \\(g(x)=x+1\\). Our last function takes its input and divides it into \\(2\\), \\(h(x)=\\frac{2}{x}\\). The claim is that \\(G=h\\circ g\\circ f\\). We find \\[(h\\circ g\\circ f)(x)=h(g(f(x)))=h(g\\left(x^{2}\\right))=h\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) =\\frac{2}{x^{2}+1}=G(x),\\] so we are done.\n3. If we look \\(H(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}\\) with an eye towards building a complicated function from simpler functions, we see the expression \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is a simple piece of the larger function. If we define \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we have \\(H(x)=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}\\). If we want to decompose \\(H=g\\circ f\\), then we can glean the formula for \\(g(x)\\) by looking at what is being done to \\(f(x)\\). We take \\(g(x)=\\frac{x+1}{x-1}\\), so \\[(g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}=H(x),\\] as required.\n### 5.1 Function Composition\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nFootnote 6: In Calculus, we will see how these ‘holes’ can be ‘plugged’ when embarking on a more advanced study of continuity.\nNeither \\(x=-1\\) nor \\(x=1\\) are in the domain of \\(h\\), yet the behavior of the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) is drastically different near these \\(x\\)-values. The reason for this lies in the second to last step when we simplified the formula for \\(h(x)\\) in Example 4.1.1, where we had \\(h(x)=\\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\). The reason \\(x=-1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) is because the factor \\((x+1)\\) appears in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\); similarly, \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\) because of the factor \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator of \\(h(x)\\). The major difference between these two factors is that \\((x-1)\\) cancels with a factor in the numerator whereas \\((x+1)\\) does not. Loosely speaking, the trouble caused by \\((x-1)\\) in the denominator is canceled away while the factor \\((x+1)\\) remains to cause mischief. This is why the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) has a vertical asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) but only a hole at \\(x=1\\). These observations are generalized and summarized in the theorem below, whose proof is found in Calculus.\n**Theorem 4.1**.: **Location of Vertical Asymptotes and Holes:**_a_ Suppose \\(r\\) is a rational function which can be written as \\(r(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have no common zeros.b Let \\(c\\) be a real number which is not in the domain of \\(r\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. To find \\(f(x+h)\\), we replace every occurrence of \\(x\\) in the formula \\(f(x)=x^{2}-x-2\\) with the quantity \\((x+h)\\) to get \\[f(x+h) = (x+h)^{2}-(x+h)-2\\] \\[= x^{2}+2xh+h^{2}-x-h-2.\\] So the difference quotient is \\[\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \\frac{\\left(x^{2}+2xh+h^{2}-x-h-2\\right)-\\left(x^{2}-x-2\\right)}{h}\\] \\[= \\frac{x^{2}+2xh+h^{2}-x-h-2-x^{2}+x+2}{h}\\] \\[= \\frac{2xh+h^{2}-h}{h}\\] \\[= \\frac{h\\left(2x+h-1\\right)}{h}\\] factor \\[= \\frac{h\\left(2x+h-1\\right)}{h}\\] cancel \\[= 2x+h-1.\\]\n2. To find \\(g(x+h)\\), we replace every occurrence of \\(x\\) in the formula \\(g(x)=\\frac{3}{2x+1}\\) with the quantity \\((x+h)\\) to get \\[g(x+h) = \\frac{3}{2(x+h)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{3}{2x+2h+1},\\] which yields \\[\\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{2x+2h+1}{h}-\\frac{3}{2x+1}}{h}\\] \\[= \\frac{3}{\\frac{2x+2h+1}{h}-\\frac{3}{2x+1}}{h}\\cdot\\frac{(2x+2h+ 1)(2x+1)}{(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{3(2x+1)-3(2x+2h+1)}{h(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{6x+3-6x-6h-3}{h(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{-6h}{h(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{-6}{(2x+2h+1)(2x+1)}.\\] Since we have managed to cancel the original '\\(h\\)' from the denominator, we are done.\n3. For \\(r(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we get \\(r(x+h)=\\sqrt{x+h}\\) so the difference quotient is \\[\\frac{r(x+h)-r(x)}{h}=\\frac{\\sqrt{x+h}-\\sqrt{x}}{h}\\] In order to cancel the '\\(h\\)' from the denominator, we rationalize the _numerator_ by multiplying by its conjugate.2 Footnote 2: Rationalizing the _numerator_!? How’s that for a twist!\n\\[\\frac{r(x+h)-r(x)}{h} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x+h}-\\sqrt{x}}{h}\\] \\[= \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{x+h}-\\sqrt{x}\\right)}{h}\\cdot\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{x+ h}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)}{\\left(\\sqrt{x+h}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)}\\] Multiply by the conjugate. \\[= \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{x+h}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^{2}}{h \\left(\\sqrt{x+h}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)}\\] Difference of Squares. \\[= \\frac{(x+h)-x}{h\\left(\\sqrt{x+h}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{h}{h\\left(\\sqrt{x+h}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{\\sqrt{x}\\left(\\sqrt{x+h}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)}\\] \\[= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+h}+\\sqrt{x}}\\]\nSince we have removed the original '\\(h\\)' from the denominator, we are done.\nAs mentioned before, we will revisit difference quotients in Section 2.1 where we will explain them geometrically. For now, we want to move on to some classic applications of function arithmetic from Economics and for that, we need to think like an entrepreneur.3\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 5.1 Function Composition\nOur domain is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup\\left[-\\frac{3}{5},\\infty\\right)\\).\n7. We find \\((h\\circ g)(x)\\) by finding \\(h(g(x))\\). * _inside out_: We insert the expression \\(g(x)\\) into \\(h\\) first to get \\[(h\\circ g)(x) = h(g(x))=h\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)}{\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{4-2\\sqrt{x+3}}{3-\\sqrt{x+3}}\\]\n* _outside in_: We use the formula for \\(h(x)\\) first to get \\[(h\\circ g)(x) = h(g(x))=\\frac{2\\left(g(x)\\right)}{\\left(g(x)\\right)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)}{\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{4-2\\sqrt{x+3}}{3-\\sqrt{x+3}}\\] To find the domain of \\(h\\circ g\\), we look to the step before any simplification: \\[(h\\circ g)(x)=\\frac{2\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)}{\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)+1}\\] To keep the square root happy, we require \\(x+3\\geq 0\\) or \\(x\\geq-3\\). Setting the denominator equal to zero gives \\(\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)+1=0\\) or \\(\\sqrt{x+3}=3\\). Squaring both sides gives us \\(x+3=9\\), or \\(x=6\\). Since \\(x=6\\) checks in the original equation, \\(\\left(2-\\sqrt{x+3}\\right)+1=0\\), we know \\(x=6\\) is the only zero of the denominator. Hence, the domain of \\(h\\circ g\\) is \\([-3,6)\\cup(6,\\infty)\\).\n8. To find \\((h\\circ h)(x)\\), we substitute the function \\(h\\) into itself, \\(h(h(x))\\). * _inside out_: We insert the expression \\(h(x)\\) into \\(h\\) to get \\[(h\\circ h)(x) = h(h(x))=h\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{\\frac{4x}{x+1}}{\\frac{2x}{x+1}+1}\\cdot\\frac{(x+1)}{(x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{\\frac{4x}{x+1}\\cdot(x+1)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)\\cdot( x+1)+1\\cdot(x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{\\frac{4x}{x+1}\\cdot(x+1)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)\\cdot( x+1)+1\\cdot(x+1)}\\] \\[= \\frac{4x}{3x+1}\\]\n* _outside in_: This approach yields \\[(h\\circ h)(x) = h(h(x))=\\frac{2(h(x))}{h(x)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1} \\right)+1}\\] \\[= \\frac{4x}{3x+1}\\hskip 56.905512pt\\mbox{same algebra as before}\\] To find the domain of \\(h\\circ h\\), we analyze \\[(h\\circ h)(x)=\\frac{2\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2x}{x+1} \\right)+1}\\] To keep the denominator \\(x+1\\) happy, we need \\(x\\neq-1\\).

Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\\[{d\\over dx}x={d\\over dx}e^{y}.\\]\nThen using the chain rule on the right hand side:\n\\[1=\\left({d\\over dx}y\\right)e^{y}=y^{\\prime}e^{y}.\\]\n\n\n",

We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nand then the outer sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\left(\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y)\\,dy\\right)\\Delta x =\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\nIn other words, we can compute the integrals in either order, first with respect to \\(x\\) then \\(y\\), or vice versa. Thinking of the loaf of bread, this corresponds to slicing the loaf in a direction perpendicular to the first.\nWe haven't really proved that the value of a double integral is equal to the value of the corresponding two single integrals in either order of integration, but provided the function is reasonably nice, this is true; the result is called **Fubini's Theorem**.\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface with slices.

Find the mean velocity of motion between times t=1 and t=10.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThere are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult but also more general.\nWe start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at \\(t=0\\) the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, \\(t=1\\)? We know that the speed of the object at time \\(t=0\\) is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when \\(t=1\\). In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at \\(t=1\\), but certainly we can do better. Let's look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object\nat each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from \\(t=0.1\\) to \\(t=0.2\\), we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at \\(t=0.1\\). In this case the object would travel \\((0.3)(0.1)=0.03\\) centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between \\(t=0.2\\) and \\(t=0.3\\) the object would travel \\((0.6)(0.1)=0.06\\) centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object travels\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAn object which weighs 6 pounds on the surface of the Earth would weigh 1 pound on the surface of the Moon, but its mass is the same in both places. In the English system of units, 'pounds' (lbs.) is a measure of force (weight), and the corresponding unit of mass is the 'slug'. In the SI system, the unit of force is 'Newtons' (N) and the associated unit of mass is the 'kilogram' (kg). We convert between mass and weight using the formula9\\(w=mg\\). Here, \\(w\\) is the weight of the object, \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In the English system, \\(g=32\\frac{\\text{fect}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\), and in the SI system, \\(g=9.8\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\). Hence, on Earth a _mass_ of 1 slug _weighs_ 32 lbs. and a _mass_ of 1 kg _weighs_ 9.8 N.10 Suppose we attach an object with mass \\(m\\) to a spring as depicted below. The weight of the object will stretch the spring. The system is said to be in 'equilibrium' when the weight of the object is perfectly balanced with the restorative force of the spring. How far the spring stretches to reach equilibrium depends on the spring's 'spring constant'. Usually denoted by the letter \\(k\\), the spring constant relates the force \\(F\\) applied to the spring to the amount \\(d\\) the spring stretches in accordance with Hooke's Law11\\(F=kd\\). If the object is released above or below the equilibrium position, or if the object is released with an upward or downward velocity, the object will bounce up and down on the end of the spring until some external force stops it. If we let \\(x(t)\\) denote the object's displacement from the equilibrium position at time \\(t\\), then \\(x(t)=0\\) means the object is at the equilibrium position, \\(x(t)<0\\) means the object is _above_ the equilibrium position, and \\(x(t)>0\\) means the object is _below_ the equilibrium position. The function \\(x(t)\\) is called the 'equation of motion' of the object.12\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nLet's recast the first example from the previous section. Suppose that the speed of the object is \\(3t\\) at time \\(t\\). How far does the object travel between time \\(t=a\\) and time \\(t=b\\)? We are no longer assuming that we know where the object is at time \\(t=0\\) or at any other\ntime. It is certainly true that it is _somewhere,_ so let's suppose that at \\(t=0\\) the position is \\(k\\). Then just as in the example, we know that the position of the object at any time is \\(3t^{2}/2+k\\). This means that at time \\(t=a\\) the position is \\(3a^{2}/2+k\\) and at time \\(t=b\\) the position is \\(3b^{2}/2+k\\). Therefore the change in position is \\(3b^{2}/2+k-(3a^{2}/2+k)=3b^{2}/2-3a^{2}/2\\). Notice that the \\(k\\) drops out; this means that it doesn't matter that we don't know \\(k\\), it doesn't even matter if we use the wrong \\(k\\), we get the correct answer. In other words, to find the change in position between time \\(a\\) and time \\(b\\) we can use _any_ antiderivative of the speed function \\(3t\\)--it need not be the one antiderivative that actually gives the location of the object.\nWhat about the second approach to this problem, in the new form? We now want to approximate the change in position between time \\(a\\) and time \\(b\\).

Our first excursion into this realm comes by way of circular motion. Suppose an object is moving as pictured below along a circular path of radius \\(r\\) from the point \\(P\\) to the point \\(Q\\) in an amount of time \\(t\\).\nHere \\(s\\) represents a _displacement_ so that \\(s>0\\) means the object is traveling in a counter-clockwise direction and \\(s<0\\) indicates movement in a clockwise direction. Note that with this convention the formula we used to define radian measure, namely \\(\\theta=\\frac{S}{r}\\), still holds since a negative value of \\(s\\) incurred from a clockwise displacement matches the negative we assign to \\(\\theta\\) for a clockwise rotation. In Physics, the **average velocity** of the object, denoted \\(\\overline{v}\\) and read as '\\(v\\)-bar', is defined as the average rate of change of the position of the object with respect to time.16 As a result, we\nhave \\(\\overline{v}=\\frac{\\text{displacement}}{\\text{time}}=\\frac{s}{t}\\). The quantity \\(\\overline{v}\\) has units of \\(\\frac{\\text{length}}{\\text{time}}\\) and conveys two ideas: the direction in which the object is moving and how fast the position of the object is changing. The contribution of direction in the quantity \\(\\overline{v}\\) is either to make it positive (in the case of counter-clockwise motion) or negative (in the case of clockwise motion), so that the quantity \\(|\\overline{v}|\\) quantifies how fast the object is moving - it is the **speed** of the object.

From \\(3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi=2\\pi\\), we get \\(\\arccos(2x-1)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). As we saw in Section 10.6, there are two possible ranges for the arcsecant function. Fortunately, both ranges contain \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). Applying Theorem 10.28 / 10.29, we get \\[\\arccos(2x-1) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] \\[\\sec(\\arccos(2x-1)) = \\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\] \\[2x-1 = 2\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Since }\\sec(\\arccos(u))=u\\] \\[x = \\frac{3}{2}\\] To check using our calculator, we need to graph \\(y=3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi\\). To do so, we make use of the identity \\(\\arccos(u)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{u}\\right)\\) from Theorems 10.28 and 10.29.16 We see the graph of \\(y=3\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2x-1}\\right)+\\pi\\) and the horizontal line \\(y=2\\pi\\) intersect at \\(\\frac{3}{2}=1.5\\).\n4. With the presence of both \\(\\arctan^{2}(x)\\) ( \\(=(\\arctan(x))^{2}\\)) and \\(\\arctan(x)\\), we substitute \\(u=\\arctan(x)\\). The equation \\(4\\arctan^{2}(x)-3\\pi\\arctan(x)-\\pi^{2}=0\\) becomes \\(4u^{2}-3\\pi u-\\pi^{2}=0\\). Factoring,17 we get \\((4u+\\pi)(u-\\pi)=0\\), so \\(u=\\arctan(x)=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) or \\(u=\\arctan(x)=\\pi\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arctangent, but \\(\\pi\\) is not, we only get solutions from the first equation. Using Theorem 10.27, we get Footnote 17: It’s not as bad as it looks... don’t let the \\(\\pi\\) throw you! \\[\\arctan(x) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = \\tan\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[x = -1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\tan(\\arctan(u))=u.\\] The calculator verifies our result.\n5. Since the inverse trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, we can solve inequalities featuring these functions using sign diagrams. Since all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\) are on one side of the inequality, we let \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) and note the domain of \\(f\\) is limited by the \\(\\arccos(x)\\) to \\([-1,1]\\). Next, we find the zeros of \\(f\\) by setting \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)=0\\). We get \\(\\arccos(x)=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), and since the range of arccosine is \\([0,\\pi]\\), we focus our attention on \\(\\arccos(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using Theorem 10.26, we get \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\) as our only zero. Hence, we have two test intervals, \\([-1,0)\\) and \\((0,1]\\). Choosing test values \\(x=\\pm 1\\), we get \\(f(-1)=-3\\pi^{2}<0\\) and \\(f(1)=\\pi^{2}>0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\), our answer is \\([-1,0)\\). The calculator confirms that for these values of \\(x\\), the graph of \\(y=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) is below \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis.)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n2. To find the domain and range of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\), we note that since the domain of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of \\(f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x\\) is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers. To determine the range of \\(f\\), we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7. Choosing our 'key' point to be \\((0,0)\\) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes \\(y=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we find that the graph of \\(y=f(x)=3\\arctan\\left(4x\\right)\\) differs from the graph of \\(y=F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\) by a horizontal compression by a factor of \\(4\\) and a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(3\\). It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of \\(\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{2},\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). We confirm our findings on the calculator below. 3. To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\nHence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(g(x)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi\\). What about \\(x=0\\)? We know \\(g(0)=\\operatorname{arccot}(0)+\\pi=\\pi\\), and neither of the formulas for \\(g\\) involving arctangent will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph \\(y=g(x)\\) on our calculators, we need to write it as a piecewise defined function:\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n### 4.9 **Uncertainties**\nThe \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-model is a \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-model, and the \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-model is a \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-model.

Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series.

The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(N\\).

As we have seen, the limit of the sequence is 1: 1 is the smallest number that is bigger than all the terms in the sequence. Similarly, all of the terms \\((n+1)/n\\) are bigger than \\(1/2\\), and the limit is 1: 1 is the largest number that is smaller than the terms of the sequence.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\nNow let's turn our attention to a few of the points on the graph. Clearly the point \\((-2,4.5)\\) does not have the largest \\(y\\) value of all of the points on the graph of \\(f\\,-\\) indeed that honor goes to \\((6,5.5)\\,-\\) but \\((-2,4.5)\\) should get some sort of consolation prize for being 'the top of the hill' between \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=3\\). We say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local maximum8** at the point \\((-2,4.5)\\), because the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(4.5\\) is the largest \\(y\\)-value (hence, function value) on the curve 'near'9\\(x=-2\\). Similarly, we say that the function \\(f\\) has a **local minimum**10 at the point \\((3,-8)\\), since the \\(y\\)-coordinate \\(-8\\) is the smallest function value near \\(x=3\\). Although it is tempting to say that local extrema11 occur when the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it is not a precise enough way to define the concepts for the needs of Calculus. At the risk of being pedantic, we will present the traditional definitions and thoroughly vet the pathologies they induce in the Exercises. We have one last observation to make before we proceed to the algebraic definitions and look at a fairly tame, yet helpful, example.\nFootnote 10: Also called a ‘relative minimum’.\nIf we look at the entire graph, we see that the largest \\(y\\) value (the largest function value) is \\(5.5\\) at \\(x=6\\). In this case, we say the **maximum12** of \\(f\\) is \\(5.5\\); similarly, the **minimum13** of \\(f\\) is \\(-8\\).\nFootnote 12: ‘Maxima’ is the plural of ‘maximum’ and ‘mimima’ is the plural of ‘minimum’. ‘Extrema’ is the plural of ‘extremum’ which combines maximum and minimum.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nand \\(b\\). We have not previously considered such points because we have not been interested in limiting a function to a small interval. An example should make this clear.\nFind the maximum and minimum values of \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\) on the interval \\([-2,1]\\), shown in figure 6.1.1. We compute \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=2x\\), which is zero at \\(x=0\\) and is always defined.\nSince \\(f^{\\prime}(1)=2\\) we would not normally flag \\(x=1\\) as a point of interest, but it is clear from the graph that _when \\(f(x)\\) is restricted to \\([-2,1]\\) there is a local maximum at \\(x=1\\)_. Likewise we would not normally pay attention to \\(x=-2\\), but since we have truncated \\(f\\) at \\(-2\\) we have introduced a new local maximum there as well. In a technical sense nothing new is going on here: When we truncate \\(f\\) we actually create a new function, let's call it \\(g\\), that is defined only on the interval \\([-2,1]\\). If we try to compute the derivative of this new function we actually find that it does not have a derivative at \\(-2\\) or \\(1\\). Why? Because to compute the derivative at \\(1\\) we must compute the limit\n\\[\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{g(1+\\Delta x)-g(1)\\over\\Delta x}.\\]\nThis limit does not exist because when \\(\\Delta x>0\\), \\(g(1+\\Delta x)\\) is not defined. It is simpler, however, simply to remember that we must always check the endpoints.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nDoes 2^x +1/x = -4 have a solution?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe eliminated not only the \\(x\\), but the \\(y\\) as well and we are left with the identity \\(0=0\\). This means that these two different linear equations are, in fact, equivalent. In other words, if an ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(2x-4y=6\\), it _automatically_ satisfies the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\). One way to describe the solution set to this system is to use the roster method2 and write \\(\\{(x,y)\\,|\\,2x-4y=6\\}\\). While this is correct (and corresponds exactly to what's happening graphically, as we shall see shortly), we take this opportunity to introduce the notion of a **parametric solution to a system**. Our first step is to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for one of the variables, say \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\). For each value of \\(x\\), the formula \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\) determines the corresponding \\(y\\)-value of a solution. Since we have no restriction on \\(x\\), it is called a **free variable**. We let \\(x=t\\), a so-called 'parameter', and get \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\). Our set of solutions can then be described as \\(\\big{\\{}\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\mid-\\infty<t<\\infty\\big{\\}}\\).3 For specific values of \\(t\\), we can generate solutions. For example, \\(t=0\\) gives us the solution \\(\\big{(}0,-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\); \\(t=117\\) gives us \\((117,57)\\), and while we can readily check each of these particular solutions satisfy both equations, the question is how do we check our general answer algebraically? Same as always. We claim that for any real number \\(t\\), the pair \\(\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\) satisfies both equations. Substituting \\(x=t\\) and \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\) into \\(2x-4y=6\\) gives \\(2t-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=6\\). Simplifying, we get \\(2t-2t+6=6\\), which is always true. Similarly, when we make these substitutions in the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\), we get \\(3t-6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=9\\) which reduces to \\(3t-3t+9=9\\), so it checks out, too. Geometrically, \\(2x-4y=6\\) and \\(3x-6y=9\\) are the same line, which means that they intersect at every point on their graphs. The reader is encouraged to think about how our parametric solution says exactly that.\nFootnote 2: See Section 1.2 for a review of this.\nFootnote 3: Note that we could have just as easily chosen to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for \\(x\\) to obtain \\(x=2y+3\\). Letting \\(y\\) be the parameter \\(t\\), we have that for any value of \\(t\\), \\(x=2t+3\\), which gives \\(\\{(2t+3,t)\\,|\\,-\\infty<t<\\infty\\}\\). There is no one correct way to parameterize the solution set, which is why it is always best to check your answer.\n\\[\\begin{array}{rccc}&6x-12y&=&18\\\\ +&(-6x+12y&=&-18)\\\\ \\hline&0&=&0\\end{array}\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nAs an added bonus,\n\\[A^{-1}A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}\\frac{4}{17}&\\frac{3}{17}\\\\ -\\frac{3}{17}&\\frac{2}{17}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}2&-3\\\\ 3&4\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right]=I_{{}_{2}}\\ \\checkmark\\]\nWe can now return to the problem at hand.

We now take a step back and analyze the foregoing discussion in a more general context. In solving for \\(A^{-1}\\), we used two augmented matrices, both of which contained the same entries as\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&-3\\\\ 3&4\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\] \\[= \\left[\\begin{array}{c}A\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\] \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2&-3\\\\ 3&4\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}A\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nWe also note that the reduced row echelon forms of these augmented matrices can be written as\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{4}{17}\\\\ -\\frac{3}{17}\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}I_{{}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array} []{c}x_{{}_{1}}\\\\ x_{{}_{3}}\\end{array}\\] \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{3}{17}\\\\ \\frac{2}{17}\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}I_{{}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right|\\begin{array} []{c}x_{{}_{2}}\\\\ x_{{}_{4}}\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nwhere we have identified the entries to the left of the vertical bar as the identity \\(I_{{}_{2}}\\) and the entries to the right of the vertical bar as the solutions to our systems.

zeros \\(0\\) and \\(2\\) divide the real number line into three test intervals. The sign diagram and accompanying graph are below. Note that the intervals on which \\(f\\) is \\((+)\\) correspond to where the graph of \\(f\\) is above the \\(x\\)-axis, and where the graph of \\(f\\) is below the \\(x\\)-axis we have that \\(f\\) is \\((-)\\). The calculator suggests something mysterious happens near \\(x=2\\). Zooming in shows the graph becomes nearly vertical there. You'll have to wait until Calculus to fully understand this phenomenon.\n2. In \\(g(x)=\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}}\\), we have two radicals both of which are even indexed. To satisfy \\(\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\), we require \\(x+3\\geq 0\\) or \\(x\\geq-3\\). To satisfy \\(\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}}\\), we need \\(2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\geq 0\\). While it may be tempting to write this as \\(2\\geq\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\) and take both sides to the fourth power, there are times when this technique will produce erroneous results.6 Instead, we solve \\(2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\geq 0\\) using a sign diagram. If we let \\(r(x)=2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\), we know \\(x\\geq-3\\), so we concern ourselves with only this portion of the number line. To find the zeros of \\(r\\) we set \\(r(x)=0\\) and solve \\(2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}=0\\). We get \\(\\sqrt[4]{x+3}=2\\) so that \\(\\left(\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\right)^{4}=2^{4}\\) from which we obtain \\(x+3=16\\) or \\(x=13\\). Since we raised both sides of an equation to an even power, we need to check to see if \\(x=13\\) is an extraneous solution.7 We find \\(x=13\\) does check since \\(2-\\sqrt[4]{x+3}=2-\\sqrt[4]{13+3}=2-\\sqrt[4]{16}=2-2=0\\). Below is our sign diagram for \\(r\\). Footnote 6: For instance, \\(-2\\geq\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\), which has no solution or \\(-2\\leq\\sqrt[4]{x+3}\\) whose solution is \\([-3,\\infty)\\). 7\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n4. Upon isolating the absolute value in the equation \\(4-|5x+3|=5\\), we get \\(|5x+3|=-1\\). At this point, we know there cannot be any real solution, since, by definition, the absolute value of _anything_ is never negative. We are done.\n5. The equation \\(|x|=x^{2}-6\\) presents us with some difficulty, since \\(x\\) appears both inside and outside of the absolute value. Moreover, there are values of \\(x\\) for which \\(x^{2}-6\\) is positive, negative and zero, so we cannot use the Equality Properties without the risk of introducing extraneous solutions, or worse, losing solutions. For this reason, we break equations like this into cases by rewriting the term in absolute values, \\(|x|\\), using Definition 2.4. For \\(x<0\\), \\(|x|=-x\\), so for \\(x<0\\), the equation \\(|x|=x^{2}-6\\) is equivalent to \\(-x=x^{2}-6\\). Rearranging this gives us \\(x^{2}+x-6=0\\), or \\((x+3)(x-2)=0\\). We get \\(x=-3\\) or \\(x=2\\). Since only \\(x=-3\\) satisfies \\(x<0\\), this is the answer we keep. For \\(x\\geq 0\\), \\(|x|=x\\), so the equation \\(|x|=x^{2}-6\\) becomes \\(x=x^{2}-6\\). From this, we get \\(x^{2}-x-6=0\\) or \\((x-3)(x+2)=0\\). Our solutions are \\(x=3\\) or \\(x=-2\\), and since only \\(x=3\\) satisfies \\(x\\geq 0\\), this is the one we keep. Hence, our two solutions to \\(|x|=x^{2}-6\\) are \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=3\\).\n6. To solve \\(|x-2|+1=x\\), we first isolate the absolute value and get \\(|x-2|=x-1\\). Since we see \\(x\\) both inside and outside of the absolute value, we break the equation into cases. The term with absolute values here is \\(|x-2|\\), so we replace '\\(x\\)' with the quantity '\\((x-2)\\)' in Definition 2.4 to get \\[|x-2|=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}-(x-2),&\\text{if}&(x-2)<0\\\\ (x-2),&\\text{if}&(x-2)\\geq 0\\end{array}\\right.\\] Simplifying yields \\[|x-2|=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}-x+2,&\\text{if}&x<2\\\\ x-2,&\\text{if}&x\\geq 2\\end{array}\\right.\\] So, for \\(x<2\\), \\(|x-2|=-x+2\\) and our equation \\(|x-2|=x-1\\) becomes \\(-x+2=x-1\\), which gives \\(x=\\frac{3}{2}\\). Since this solution satisfies \\(x<2\\), we keep it. Next, for \\(x\\geq 2\\), \\(|x-2|=x-2\\), so the equation \\(|x-2|=x-1\\) becomes \\(x-2=x-1\\). Here, the equation reduces to \\(-2=-1\\), which signifies we have no solutions here. Hence, our only solution is \\(x=\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n\n",

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nAt the very last step we have used theorems 2.3.9 and 2.3.10. \\(\\Box\\)\nOccasionally we will need a slightly modified version of the limit definition. Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\nDocument 3:\n----\nIf \\(f(i)\\) defines a sequence, and \\(f(x)\\) makes sense, and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\), then it is clear that \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}f(i)=L\\) as well, but it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true. For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0. Consider this, however: Let \\(f(n)=\\sin(n\\pi)\\). This is the sequence\n\\[\\sin(0\\pi),\\sin(1\\pi),\\sin(2\\pi),\\sin(3\\pi),\\ldots=0,0,0,0,\\ldots\\]\nsince \\(\\sin(n\\pi)=0\\) when \\(n\\) is an integer. Thus \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)=0\\). But \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), when \\(x\\) is real, does not exist: as \\(x\\) gets bigger and bigger, the values \\(\\sin(x\\pi)\\) do not get closer and\ncloser to a single value, but take on all values between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) over and over. In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for integer values, the graph is just a sequence of dots. In figure 1.1.1 we see the graphs of two sequences and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.\n\\(f(n)=1/n\\)\n**Theorem 11.1.3**Suppose that \\(a_{n}\\leq b_{n}\\leq c_{n}\\) for all \\(n>N\\), for some \\(N\\). If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}c_{n}=L\\), then \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_{n}=L\\).\nAnd a final useful fact:\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Definition 4.3**.: The line \\(y=c\\) is called a **horizontal asymptote** of the graph of a function \\(y=f(x)\\) if as \\(x\\to-\\infty\\) or as \\(x\\to\\infty\\), \\(f(x)\\to c\\). \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\nNote that in Definition 4.3, we write \\(f(x)\\to c\\) (not \\(f(x)\\to c^{+}\\) or \\(f(x)\\to c^{-}\\)) because we are unconcerned from which direction the values \\(f(x)\\) approach the value \\(c\\), just as long as they do so.4 In our discussion following Example 4.1.1, we determined that, despite the fact that the formula for \\(h(x)\\) reduced to the same formula as \\(f(x)\\), the functions \\(f\\) and \\(h\\) are different, since \\(x=1\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\), but \\(x=1\\) is not in the domain of \\(h\\). If we graph \\(h(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}-\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\) using a graphing calculator, we are surprised to find that the graph looks identical to the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). There is a vertical asymptote at \\(x=-1\\), but near \\(x=1\\), everything seem fine. Tables of values provide numerical evidence which supports the graphical observation.\nFootnote 4: As we shall see in the next section, the graphs of rational functions may, in fact, _cross_ their horizontal asymptotes. If this happens, however, it does so only a _finite_ number of times, and so for each choice of \\(x\\to-\\infty\\) and \\(x\\to\\infty\\), \\(f(x)\\) will approach \\(c\\) from either below (in the case \\(f(x)\\to c^{-}\\)) or above (in the case \\(f(x)\\to c^{+}\\).) We leave \\(f(x)\\to c\\) generic in our definition, however, to allow this concept to apply to less tame specimens in the Precalculus zoo, such as Exercise 50 in Section 10.5.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n**Theorem 11.9.1**: Suppose the power series \\(f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}(x-a)^{n}\\) has radius of convergence \\(R\\). Then\n\\[f^{\\prime}(x) =\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}na_{n}(x-a)^{n-1},\\] \\[\\int f(x)\\,dx =C+\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{a_{n}}{n+1}(x-a)^{n+1},\\]\nand these two series have radius of convergence \\(R\\) as well.\n**Example 11.9.2**: Starting with the geometric series:\n\\[\\frac{1}{1-x}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x^{n}\\]\n\\[\\int\\frac{1}{1-x}\\,dx=-\\ln|1-x|+C=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}\\]\n\\[\\ln|1-x|=C+\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}-\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}\\]\nWe can figure out what \\(C\\) is: When \\(x=0\\), this becomes \\(\\ln|1|=C+0\\), so \\(C=0\\), and \\(\\ln|1-x|=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}-\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}\\), when \\(|x|<1\\). The series does not converge when \\(x=1\\) but does converge when \\(x=-1\\) or \\(1-x=2\\). The interval of convergence is \\([-1,1)\\), or \\(0<1-x\\leq 2\\), so we can use the series to represent \\(\\ln(x)\\) when \\(0<x\\leq 2\\). For example\n\\[\\ln(3/2)=\\ln(1-1/2)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n}\\frac{1}{n+1}\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\\]\nand so\n\\[\\ln(3/2)\\approx\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{24}-\\frac{1}{64}+\\frac{1}{16 0}-\\frac{1}{384}+\\frac{1}{896}=\\frac{909}{2240}\\approx 0.406.\\]\nBecause this is an alternating series with decreasing terms, we know that the true value is between \\(909/2240\\) and \\(909/2240-1/2048=29053/71680\\approx.4053\\), so correct to two decimal places the value is \\(0.41\\).\nWhat about \\(\\ln(9/4)\\)? Since \\(9/4\\) is larger than \\(2\\) we cannot use the series directly, but\n\\[\\ln(9/4)=\\ln((3/2)^{2})=2\\ln(3/2)\\approx 0.82,\\]\nso in fact we get a lot more from this one calculation than first meets the eye. To estimate the true value accurately we actually need to be a bit more careful. When we multiply by two we know that the true value is between \\(0.8106\\) and \\(0.812\\), so rounded to two decimal places the true value is \\(0.81\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

What temperature values in degrees Celsius are equivalent to the temperature range \\(50^{\\circ}F\\) to \\(95^{\\circ}F\\)? (Refer to Exercise 35 in Section 2.1 for assistance if needed.)\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n**Solution.**\n1. We first note that the independent variable here is \\(t\\), chosen because it represents time. Secondly, the function is broken up into two rules: one formula for values of \\(t\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\) inclusive, and another for values of \\(t\\) greater than \\(20\\). Since \\(t=10\\) satisfies the inequality \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), we use the first formula listed, \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), to find \\(h(10)\\). We get \\(h(10)=-5(10)^{2}+100(10)=500\\). Since \\(t\\) represents the number of seconds since lift-off and \\(h(t)\\) is the height above the ground in feet, the equation \\(h(10)=500\\) means that \\(10\\) seconds after lift-off, the model rocket is \\(500\\) feet above the ground. To find \\(h(60)\\), we note that \\(t=60\\) satisfies \\(t>20\\), so we use the rule \\(h(t)=0\\). This function returns a value of \\(0\\) regardless of what value is substituted in for \\(t\\), so \\(h(60)=0\\). This means that \\(60\\) seconds after lift-off, the rocket is \\(0\\) feet above the ground; in other words, a minute after lift-off, the rocket has already returned to Earth.\n2. Since the function \\(h\\) is defined in pieces, we need to solve \\(h(t)=375\\) in pieces. For \\(0\\leq t\\leq 20\\), \\(h(t)=-5t^{2}+100t\\), so for these values of \\(t\\), we solve \\(-5t^{2}+100t=375\\). Rearranging terms, we get \\(5t^{2}-100t+375=0\\), and factoring gives \\(5(t-5)(t-15)=0\\). Our answers are \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\), and since both of these values of \\(t\\) lie between \\(0\\) and \\(20\\), we keep both solutions. For \\(t>20\\), \\(h(t)=0\\), and in this case, there are no solutions to \\(0=375\\). In terms of the model rocket, solving \\(h(t)=375\\) corresponds to finding when, if ever, the rocket reaches \\(375\\) feet above the ground. Our two answers, \\(t=5\\) and \\(t=15\\) correspond to the rocket reaching this altitude _twice_ - once \\(5\\) seconds after launch, and again \\(15\\) seconds after launch.12\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n* 50 feet by 50 feet; maximum area is 2500 feet; he can raise 100 average alpacas.\n* The largest rectangle has area 12.25 square inches.\n* 2 seconds.\n* The rocket reaches its maximum height of 500 feet 10 seconds after lift-off.\n* The hammer reaches a maximum height of approximately 13.62 feet. The hammer is in the air approximately 1.61 seconds.\n25. 1. The applied domain is \\([0,\\infty)\\). 2. The height function is this case is \\(s(t)=-4.9t^{2}+15t\\). The vertex of this parabola is approximately \\((1.53,11.48)\\) so the maximum height reached by the marble is \\(11.48\\) meters. It hits the ground again when \\(t\\approx 3.06\\) seconds. 2. The revised height function is \\(s(t)=-4.9t^{2}+15t+25\\) which has zeros at \\(t\\approx-1.20\\) and \\(t\\approx 4.26\\). We ignore the negative value and claim that the marble will hit the ground after \\(4.26\\) seconds. 3. Shooting down means the initial velocity is negative so the height functions becomes \\(s(t)=-4.9t^{2}-15t+25\\).\n26. Make the vertex of the parabola \\((0,10)\\) so that the point on the top of the left-hand tower where the cable connects is \\((-200,100)\\) and the point on the top of the right-hand tower is \\((200,100)\\). Then the parabola is given by \\(p(x)=\\frac{9}{4000}x^{2}+10\\). Standing \\(50\\) feet to the right of the left-hand tower means you're standing at \\(x=-150\\) and \\(p(-150)=60.625\\). So the cable is \\(60.625\\) feet above the bridge deck there.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n29. \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\infty\\right)\\)\n30. \\(\\left(-\\infty,-1\\right]\\cup\\left\\{0\\right\\}\\cup\\left[1,\\infty\\right)\\)\n31. \\(\\left[-6,-3\\right]\\cup\\left[-2,\\infty\\right)\\)\n32. \\(\\left(-\\infty,1\\right)\\cup\\left(2,\\frac{3+\\sqrt{17}}{2}\\right)\\)\n33. \\(P(x)\\geq 50\\) on \\(\\left[10,15\\right]\\).

However, since the model is valid only for \\(t\\), \\(0\\leq t\\leq 12\\), we restrict our answer and find it is warmer than \\(42^{\\circ}\\) Fahrenheit from 7:22 AM to 6 PM.\n36. \\(h(t)\\geq 250\\) on \\([10-5\\sqrt{2},10+5\\sqrt{2}]\\approx[2.93,17.07]\\).

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nIf $x=4*cost(t)$ and $y=8*sin(x)$, what is $y{''}_{xx}$ at t=pi/3?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nSuppose a mass \\(m\\) is hung on a spring with spring constant \\(k\\). If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. 1. We know \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\\) is the real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\tan(t)=\\sqrt{3}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), so \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The real number \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})\\) lies in the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\sqrt{3}\\). We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\). 3. We can apply Theorem 10.27 directly and obtain \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=-5\\). However, working it through provides us with yet another opportunity to understand why this is the case. Letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-5)\\), we have that \\(t\\) belongs to the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). 4. We start simplifying \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)\\) by letting \\(t=\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\). Then \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\) for some \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Since \\(\\tan(t)<0\\), we know, in fact, \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\). One way to proceed is to use The Pythagorean Identity, \\(1+\\operatorname{cot}^{2}(t)=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\), since this relates the reciprocals of \\(\\tan(t)\\) and \\(\\sin(t)\\) and is valid for all \\(t\\) under consideration.4 From \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\), we get \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\frac{4}{3}\\). Substituting, we get \\(1+\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2}=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\) so that \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=\\pm\\frac{5}{3}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\), we choose \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), so \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). 2. 1. If we let \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\), then \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\tan(t)=x\\). We look for a way to express \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Before we get started using identities, we note that \\(\\tan(2t)\\) is undefined when \\(2t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 tells us we need to exclude values of \\(t\\) where \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. The only members of this family which lie in \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) are \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), which means the values of \\(t\\) under consideration are \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\cup\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{ 4}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Returning to \\(\\arctan(2t)\\), we note the double angle identity \\(\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}\\), is valid for all the values of \\(t\\) under consideration, hence we get \\[\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\]\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n3. From \\(3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi=2\\pi\\), we get \\(\\arccos(2x-1)=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). As we saw in Section 10.6, there are two possible ranges for the arcsecant function. Fortunately, both ranges contain \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). Applying Theorem 10.28 / 10.29, we get \\[\\arccos(2x-1) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] \\[\\sec(\\arccos(2x-1)) = \\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\] \\[2x-1 = 2\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Since }\\sec(\\arccos(u))=u\\] \\[x = \\frac{3}{2}\\] To check using our calculator, we need to graph \\(y=3\\arccos(2x-1)+\\pi\\). To do so, we make use of the identity \\(\\arccos(u)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{u}\\right)\\) from Theorems 10.28 and 10.29.16 We see the graph of \\(y=3\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2x-1}\\right)+\\pi\\) and the horizontal line \\(y=2\\pi\\) intersect at \\(\\frac{3}{2}=1.5\\).\n4. With the presence of both \\(\\arctan^{2}(x)\\) ( \\(=(\\arctan(x))^{2}\\)) and \\(\\arctan(x)\\), we substitute \\(u=\\arctan(x)\\). The equation \\(4\\arctan^{2}(x)-3\\pi\\arctan(x)-\\pi^{2}=0\\) becomes \\(4u^{2}-3\\pi u-\\pi^{2}=0\\). Factoring,17 we get \\((4u+\\pi)(u-\\pi)=0\\), so \\(u=\\arctan(x)=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) or \\(u=\\arctan(x)=\\pi\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is in the range of arctangent, but \\(\\pi\\) is not, we only get solutions from the first equation. Using Theorem 10.27, we get Footnote 17: It’s not as bad as it looks... don’t let the \\(\\pi\\) throw you! \\[\\arctan(x) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\] \\[\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = \\tan\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[x = -1\\hskip 56.905512pt\\text{Since }\\tan(\\arctan(u))=u.\\] The calculator verifies our result.\n5. Since the inverse trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, we can solve inequalities featuring these functions using sign diagrams. Since all of the nonzero terms of \\(\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\) are on one side of the inequality, we let \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) and note the domain of \\(f\\) is limited by the \\(\\arccos(x)\\) to \\([-1,1]\\). Next, we find the zeros of \\(f\\) by setting \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)=0\\). We get \\(\\arccos(x)=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), and since the range of arccosine is \\([0,\\pi]\\), we focus our attention on \\(\\arccos(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using Theorem 10.26, we get \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\) as our only zero. Hence, we have two test intervals, \\([-1,0)\\) and \\((0,1]\\). Choosing test values \\(x=\\pm 1\\), we get \\(f(-1)=-3\\pi^{2}<0\\) and \\(f(1)=\\pi^{2}>0\\). Since we are looking for where \\(f(x)=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)<0\\), our answer is \\([-1,0)\\). The calculator confirms that for these values of \\(x\\), the graph of \\(y=\\pi^{2}-4\\arccos^{2}(x)\\) is below \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x\\)-axis.)\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. For the system \\(\\left\\{x=\\sin(t),\\,y=\\csc(t)\\,\\right.\\) for \\(0<t<\\pi\\), we start by graphing \\(x=\\sin(t)\\) and \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) over the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\). We find that the range of \\(x\\) is \\((0,1]\\) while the range of \\(y\\) is \\([1,\\infty)\\). Plotting a few friendly points, we see that \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) gives the point \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\), \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) gives \\((1,1)\\) and \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) returns us to \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\). Since \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=\\pi\\) aren't included in the domain for \\(t\\), (because \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) is undefined at these \\(t\\)-values), we analyze the behavior of the system as \\(t\\) approaches \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\). We find that as \\(t\\to 0^{+}\\) as well as when \\(t\\to\\pi^{-}\\), we get \\(x=\\sin(t)\\to 0^{+}\\) and \\(y=\\csc(t)\\to\\infty\\). Piecing all of this information together, we get that for \\(t\\) near \\(0\\), we have points with very small positive \\(x\\)-values, but very large positive \\(y\\)-values. As \\(t\\) ranges through the interval \\(\\left(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\), \\(x=\\sin(t)\\) is increasing and \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) is decreasing. This means that we are moving to the right and downwards, through \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) to \\((1,1)\\) when \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Once \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), the orientation reverses, and we start to head to the left, since \\(x=\\sin(t)\\) is now decreasing, and up, since \\(y=\\csc(t)\\) is now increasing. We pass back through \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},2\\right)\\) when \\(t=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) back to the points with small positive \\(x\\)-coordinates and large\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n1. We resist the temptation to divide both sides of \\(3\\sin^{3}(x)=\\sin^{2}(x)\\) by \\(\\sin^{2}(x)\\) (What goes wrong if you do?) and instead gather all of the terms to one side of the equation and factor. \\[3\\sin^{3}(x) = \\sin^{2}(x)\\] \\[3\\sin^{3}(x)-\\sin^{2}(x) = 0\\] \\[\\sin^{2}(x)(3\\sin(x)-1) = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Factor out $\\sin^{2}(x)$ from both terms}.\\] We get \\(\\sin^{2}(x)=0\\) or \\(3\\sin(x)-1=0\\). Solving for \\(\\sin(x)\\), we find \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\). The solution to the first equation is \\(x=\\pi k\\), with \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) being the two solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To solve \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\), we use the arcsine function to get \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). We find the two solutions here which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) to be \\(x=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(x=\\pi-\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\). To check graphically, we plot \\(y=3(\\sin(x))^{3}\\) and \\(y=(\\sin(x))^{2}\\) and find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points of these two curves. Some extra zooming is required near \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=\\pi\\) to verify that these two curves do in fact intersect four times.6 Footnote 6: Note that we are _not_ counting the point \\((2\\pi,0)\\) in our solution set since \\(x=2\\pi\\) is not in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\). In the forthcoming solutions, remember that while \\(x=2\\pi\\) may be a solution to the equation, it isn’t counted among the solutions in \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\n\n",

The quantity we are really interested in does not make sense \"at zero,\" and this is why the answer to the original problem (finding a velocity or a slope) was not immediately obvious. In other words, we are generally going to want to figure out what a quantity \"approaches\" in situations where we can't merely plug in a value. If you would like to think about a hard example (which we will analyze later) consider what happens to \\((\\sin x)/x\\) as \\(x\\) approaches zero. Try evaluating this expression on a calculator for smaller and smaller values of \\(x\\); do they seem to approach some fixed value?\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.1**Does \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) approach 1.41 as \\(x\\) approaches 2? In this case it is possible to compute the actual value \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to a high precision to answer the question. But since in general we won't be able to do that, let's not. We might start by computing \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) for values of \\(x\\) close to 2, as we did in the previous sections. Here are some values: \\(\\sqrt{2.05}=1.431782106\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.04}=1.428285686\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.03}=1.424780685\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.02}=1.421267040\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.01}=1.417744688\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.005}=1.415980226\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.004}=1.415627070\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.003}=1.415273825\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.002}=1.414920492\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.001}=1.414567072\\). So it looks at least possible that indeed these values \"approach\" 1.41--already \\(\\sqrt{2.001}\\) is quite close. If we continue this process, however, at some point we will appear to \"stall.\" In fact, \\(\\sqrt{2}=1.414213562\\ldots\\), so we will never even get as far as 1.4142, no matter how long we continue the sequence. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\\[(f(0)+4f(1/4)+2f(1/2)+4f(3/4)+f(1))\\frac{1}{3\\cdot 4}\\approx 0.746855.\\]\nSo the true value of the integral is between \\(0.746855-0.0003=0.746555\\) and \\(0.746855+0.0003=0.7471555\\), both of which round to \\(0.75\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nFigure 8.6.3: A parabola (dashed) approximating a curve (solid).

As we have picked a particular one, we should investigate the magnitude and direction.\n### Chapter 12 Three Dimensions\nWe know how to compute the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\); it's a bit messy but not difficult. It is somewhat easier to work initially with the square of the magnitude, so as to avoid the square root:\n\\[|\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}|^{2} =(a_{2}b_{3}-b_{2}a_{3})^{2}+(b_{1}a_{3}-a_{1}b_{3})^{2}+(a_{1}b_{ 2}-b_{1}a_{2})^{2}\\] \\[=a_{2}^{2}b_{3}^{2}-2a_{2}b_{3}b_{2}a_{3}+b_{2}^{2}a_{3}^{2}+b_{1} ^{2}a_{3}^{2}-2b_{1}a_{3}a_{1}b_{3}+a_{1}^{2}b_{3}^{2}+a_{1}^{2}b_{2}^{2}-2a_{ 1}b_{2}b_{1}a_{2}+b_{1}^{2}a_{2}^{2}\\]\nWhile it is far from obvious, this nasty looking expression can be simplified:\n\\[|\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}|^{2} =(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2})(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+b_{3}^{2})-( a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3})^{2}\\] \\[=|\\mathbf{A}|^{2}|\\mathbf{B}|^{2}-(\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{B})^{2}\\] \\[=|\\mathbf{A}|^{2}|\\mathbf{B}|^{2}-|\\mathbf{A}|^{2}|\\mathbf{B}|^{2 }\\cos^{2}\\theta\\] \\[=|\\mathbf{A}|^{2}|\\mathbf{B}|^{2}(1-\\cos^{2}\\theta)\\] \\[=|\\mathbf{A}|^{2}|\\mathbf{B}|^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta\\] \\[|\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}| =|\\mathbf{A}||\\mathbf{B}|\\sin\\theta\\]\nThe magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\) is thus very similar to the dot product. In particular, notice that if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), the angle between them is zero, so \\(\\sin\\theta=0\\), so \\(|\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}|=0\\), and likewise if they are anti-parallel, \\(\\sin\\theta=0\\), and \\(|\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}|=0\\). Conversely, if \\(|\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}|=0\\) and \\(|\\mathbf{A}|\\) and \\(|\\mathbf{B}|\\) are not zero, it must be that \\(\\sin\\theta=0\\), so \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is parallel or anti-parallel to \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n3. The denominator factors as \\(x\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)\\). We see immediately that \\(x=0\\) is a zero of multiplicity one, but the zeros of \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) aren't as easy to discern. The quadratic doesn't factor easily, so we check the discriminant and find it to be \\((-1)^{2}-4(1)(1)=-3<0\\). We find its zeros are not real so it is an irreducible quadratic. The form of the partial fraction decomposition is then \\[\\frac{3}{x^{3}-x^{2}+x}=\\frac{3}{x\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)}=\\frac{A}{x}+\\frac{ Bx+C}{x^{2}-x+1}\\] Proceeding as usual, we clear denominators and get \\(3=A\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)+(Bx+C)x\\) or \\(3=(A+B)x^{2}+(-A+C)x+A\\). We get \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}A+B&=&0\\\\ -A+C&=&0\\\\ A&=&3\\end{array}\\right.\\] From \\(A=3\\) and \\(A+B=0\\), we get \\(B=-3\\). From \\(-A+C=0\\), we get \\(C=A=3\\). We get \\[\\frac{3}{x^{3}-x^{2}+x}=\\frac{3}{x}+\\frac{3-3x}{x^{2}-x+1}\\]\n4. Since \\(\\frac{4x^{3}}{x^{2}-2}\\) isn't proper, we use long division and we get a quotient of \\(4x\\) with a remainder of \\(8x\\). That is, \\(\\frac{4x^{3}}{x^{2}-2}=4x+\\frac{8x}{x^{2}-2}\\) so we now work on resolving \\(\\frac{8x}{x^{2}-2}\\) into partial fractions. The quadratic \\(x^{2}-2\\), though it doesn't factor nicely, is, nevertheless, reducible. Solving \\(x^{2}-2=0\\)\ngives us \\(x=\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\), and each of these zeros must be of multiplicity one since Theorem 3.14 enables us to now factor \\(x^{2}-2=\\left(x-\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\left(x+\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\). Hence, \\[\\frac{8x}{x^{2}-2}=\\frac{8x}{\\left(x-\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\left(x+\\sqrt{2}\\right)}= \\frac{A}{x-\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{B}{x+\\sqrt{2}}\\] Clearing fractions, we get \\(8x=A\\left(x+\\sqrt{2}\\right)+B\\left(x-\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\) or \\(8x=(A+B)x+(A-B)\\sqrt{2}\\). We get the system \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}A+B&=&8\\\\ (A-B)\\sqrt{2}&=&0\\end{array}\\right.\\] From \\((A-B)\\sqrt{2}=0\\), we get \\(A=B\\), which, when substituted into \\(A+B=8\\) gives \\(B=4\\). Hence, \\(A=B=4\\) and we get \\[\\frac{4x^{3}}{x^{2}-2}=4x+\\frac{8x}{x^{2}-2}=4x+\\frac{4}{x+\\sqrt{2}}+\\frac{4}{ x-\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n5. At first glance, the denominator \\(D(x)=x^{4}+6x^{2}+9\\) appears irreducible. However, \\(D(x)\\) has three terms, and the exponent on the first term is exactly twice that of the second. Rewriting \\(D(x)=\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{2}+6x^{2}+9\\), we see it is a quadratic in disguise and factor \\(D(x)=\\left(x^{2}+3\\right)^{2}\\). Since \\(x^{2}+3\\) clearly has no real zeros, it is irreducible and the form of the decomposition is \\[\\frac{x^{3}+5x-1}{x^{4}+6x^{2}+9}=\\frac{x^{3}+5x-1}{\\left(x^{2}+3\\right)^{2}}= \\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+3}+\\frac{Cx+D}{\\left(x^{2}+3\\right)^{2}}\\] When we clear denominators, we find \\(x^{3}+5x-1=\\left(Ax+B\\right)\\left(x^{2}+3\\right)+Cx+D\\) which yields \\(x^{3}+5x-1=Ax^{3}+Bx^{2}+(3A+C)x+3B+D\\). Our system is \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rcl}A&=&1\\\\ B&=&0\\\\ 3A+C&=&5\\\\ 3B+D&=&-1\\end{array}\\right.\\] We have \\(A=1\\) and \\(B=0\\) from which we get \\(C=2\\) and \\(D=-1\\). Our final answer is \\[\\frac{x^{3}+5x-1}{x^{4}+6x^{2}+9}=\\frac{x}{x^{2}+3}+\\frac{2x-1}{\\left(x^{2}+3 \\right)^{2}}\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n\\(\\bullet\\)\\(\\\nFrom this sketch, we know that the major axis is horizontal, meaning \\(a>b\\). With the vertices located at \\((\\pm 5,0)\\), we get \\(a=5\\) so \\(a^{2}=25\\). We also know that the center is \\((0,0)\\) because the center is the midpoint of the vertices. All that remains is to find \\(b^{2}\\). To that end, we use the fact that the eccentricity \\(e=\\frac{1}{4}\\) which means\n\\[e=\\frac{\\text{distance from the center to a focus}}{\\text{distance from the center to a vertex}}=\\frac{c}{a}=\\frac{c}{5}=\\frac{1}{4}\\]\nfrom which we get \\(c=\\frac{5}{4}\\). To get \\(b^{2}\\), we use the fact that \\(c=\\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\\), so \\(\\frac{5}{4}=\\sqrt{25-b^{2}}\\) from which we get \\(b^{2}=\\frac{375}{16}\\). Substituting all of our findings into the equation \\(\\frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\\), yields our final answer \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{25}+\\frac{16y^{2}}{375}=1\\).\nAs with parabolas, ellipses have a reflective property. If we imagine the dashed lines below representing sound waves, then the waves emanating from one focus reflect off the top of the ellipse and head towards the other focus.\nSuch geometry is exploited in the construction of so-called 'Whispering Galleries'. If a person whispers at one focus, a person standing at the other focus will hear the first person as if they were standing right next to them. We explore the Whispering Galleries in our last example.\n**Example 7.4.5**.: Jamie and Jason want to exchange secrets (terrible secrets) from across a crowded whispering gallery. Recall that a whispering gallery is a room which, in cross section, is half of an ellipse. If the room is 40 feet high at the center and 100 feet wide at the floor, how far from the outer wall should each of them stand so that they will be positioned at the foci of the ellipse?\n\n\n",

The quantity we are really interested in does not make sense \"at zero,\" and this is why the answer to the original problem (finding a velocity or a slope) was not immediately obvious. In other words, we are generally going to want to figure out what a quantity \"approaches\" in situations where we can't merely plug in a value. If you would like to think about a hard example (which we will analyze later) consider what happens to \\((\\sin x)/x\\) as \\(x\\) approaches zero. Try evaluating this expression on a calculator for smaller and smaller values of \\(x\\); do they seem to approach some fixed value?\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.1**Does \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) approach 1.41 as \\(x\\) approaches 2? In this case it is possible to compute the actual value \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to a high precision to answer the question. But since in general we won't be able to do that, let's not. We might start by computing \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) for values of \\(x\\) close to 2, as we did in the previous sections. Here are some values: \\(\\sqrt{2.05}=1.431782106\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.04}=1.428285686\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.03}=1.424780685\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.02}=1.421267040\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.01}=1.417744688\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.005}=1.415980226\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.004}=1.415627070\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.003}=1.415273825\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.002}=1.414920492\\), \\(\\sqrt{2.001}=1.414567072\\). So it looks at least possible that indeed these values \"approach\" 1.41--already \\(\\sqrt{2.001}\\) is quite close. If we continue this process, however, at some point we will appear to \"stall.\" In fact, \\(\\sqrt{2}=1.414213562\\ldots\\), so we will never even get as far as 1.4142, no matter how long we continue the sequence. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n5. The equation \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=-3\\) has the form \\(\\tan(u)=-3\\), whose solution is \\(u=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\). Hence, \\(\\frac{x}{2}=\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\), so \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check, we note \\[\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)+\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\tan\\left(\\arctan(-3)\\right)\\qquad\\quad\\text{(the period of tangent is $\\pi$)}\\] \\[= -3\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{(See Theorem \\ref{eq:2.2})}\\] To determine which of our answers lie in the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we first need to get an idea of the value of \\(2\\arctan(-3)\\). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). For \\(k=0\\), we get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), so we discard this answer and all answers \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) where \\(k<0\\). Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Advancing \\(k\\) to \\(2\\) produces \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\). Once again, we get from \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\) that \\(3\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi<4\\pi\\). Since this is outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we discard \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+4\\pi\\) and all solutions of the form \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) for \\(k>2\\). Graphically, we see \\(y=\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\) and \\(y=-3\\) intersect only once on \\([0,2\\pi)\\) at \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\approx 3.7851\\). Footnote 5: Your instructor will let you know if you should abandon the analytic route at this point and use your calculator. But seriously, what fun would that be?\n6. To solve \\(\\sin(2x)=0.87\\), we first note that it has the form \\(\\sin(u)=0.87\\), which has the family of solutions \\(u=\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\pi-\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of sine here is \\(2x\\), we get \\(2x=\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\pi-\\arcsin(0.87)+2\\pi k\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\arcsin(0.87)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check,\n\nDocument 3:\n----\n1. We begin solving \\(2\\sin(x)\\leq 1\\) by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and zero on the other to get \\(2\\sin(x)-1\\leq 0\\). Next, we let \\(f(x)=2\\sin(x)-1\\) and note that our original inequality is equivalent to solving \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\). We now look to see where, if ever, \\(f\\) is undefined and where \\(f(x)=0\\). Since the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, we can immediately set about finding the zeros of \\(f\\). Solving \\(f(x)=0\\), we have \\(2\\sin(x)-1=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\). The solutions here are \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since we are restricting our attention to \\([0,2\\pi)\\), only \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\) are of concern to us. Next, we choose test values in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) other than the zeros and determine if \\(f\\) is positive or negative there. For \\(x=0\\) we have \\(f(0)=-1\\), for \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) and for \\(x=\\pi\\) we get \\(f(\\pi)=-1\\). Since our original inequality is equivalent to \\(f(x)\\leq 0\\), we are looking for where the function is negative \\((-)\\) or \\(0\\), and we get the intervals \\(\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right]\\cup\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{6},2\\pi\\right)\\). We can confirm our answer graphically by seeing where the graph of \\(y=2\\sin(x)\\) crosses or is below the graph of \\(y=1\\). \\[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{ Fig8}&\\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8}& \\includegraphics[width=142.\n\nDocument 4:\n----\n**Example 8.3.1**: Evaluate \\(\\int\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\,dx\\).

While we could approach \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\) in the same manner as we did the previous two problems, we choose instead to showcase the utility of the Sum to Product Identities. From \\(\\cos(3x)=\\cos(5x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=0\\), and it is the presence of \\(0\\) on the right hand side that indicates a switch to a product would be a good move.7 Using Theorem 10.21, we have that \\(\\cos(5x)-\\cos(3x)=-2\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x+3x}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{5x-3x}{2} \\right)=-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)\\). Hence, the equation \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is equivalent to \\(-2\\sin(4x)\\sin(x)=0\\). From this, we get \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) or \\(\\sin(x)=0\\). Solving \\(\\sin(4x)=0\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\), and the solution to \\(\\sin(x)=0\\) is \\(x=\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The second set of solutions is contained in the first set of solutions,8 so our final solution to \\(\\cos(5x)=\\cos(3x)\\) is \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}k\\) for integers \\(k\\). There are eight of these answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\): \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\).

As we have already mentioned, the distinction between \\(t\\) as a real number and as an angle \\(\\theta=t\\) radians is often blurred. Indeed, we solve \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) in the exact same manner12 as we did in Example 10.2.5 number 2. Our solution is only cosmetically different in that the variable used is \\(t\\) rather than \\(\\theta\\): \\(t=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(t=\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers, \\(k\\). We will study the cosine and sine functions in greater detail in Section 10.5. Until then, keep in mind that any properties of cosine and sine developed in the following sections which regard them as functions of _angles_ in _radian_ measure apply equally well if the inputs are regarded as _real numbers_.\n#### 10.2.2 Exercises\nIn Exercises 1 - 20, find the exact value of the cosine and sine of the given angle.\n1. \\(\\theta=0\\) \\(2.\\ \\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) \\(3.\\ \\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) \\(4.\\ \\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)\n2. \\(\\theta=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) \\(6.\\ \\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) \\(7.\\ \\theta=\\pi\\) \\(8.\\ \\theta=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\)\n3. \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\) \\(10.\\ \\theta=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) \\(11.\\ \\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) \\(12.\\ \\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy&=\\int 2\\,dt\\cr(-1)\\ln|25-y|&=2t+C_{0}\\cr\\ln|25-y|&=-2t-C_{ 0}=-2t+C\\cr|25-y|&=e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t}e^{C}\\cr y-25&=\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-2t}\\cr y&=25 \\pm e^{C}e^{-2t}=25+Ae^{-2t}.}\\]\nHere \\(A=\\pm\\,e^{C}=\\pm\\,e^{-C_{0}}\\) is some non-zero constant. Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\).

Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution.

Using Theorem 10.3 from Section 10.2 with \\(x=-3\\) and \\(y=4\\), we find \\(r=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{4}{5}\\). Applying Theorem 10.17, we get \\(\\cos(2\\theta)=\\cos^{2}(\\theta)-\\sin^{2}(\\theta)=\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2}- \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{2}=-\\frac{7}{25}\\), and \\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=2\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac {3}{5}\\right)=-\\frac{24}{25}\\). Since both cosine and sine of \\(2\\theta\\) are negative, the terminal side of \\(2\\theta\\), when plotted in standard position, lies in Quadrant III.\n2. If your first reaction to '\\(\\sin(\\theta)=x\\)' is 'No it's not, \\(\\cos(\\theta)=x\\)!' then you have indeed learned something, and we take comfort in that. However, context is everything. Here, '\\(x\\)' is just a variable - it does not necessarily represent the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point on The Unit Circle which lies on the terminal side of \\(\\theta\\), assuming \\(\\theta\\) is drawn in standard position. Here, \\(x\\) represents the quantity \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\), and what we wish to know is how to express \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). We will see more of this kind of thing in Section 10.6, and, as usual, this is something we need for Calculus. Since \\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\), we need to write \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) in terms of \\(x\\) to finish the problem. We substitute \\(x=\\sin(\\theta)\\) into the Pythagorean Identity, \\(\\cos^{2}(\\theta)+\\sin^{2}(\\theta)=1\\), to get \\(\\cos^{2}(\\theta)+x^{2}=1\\), or \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\leq\\theta\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\geq 0\\), and thus \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Our final answer is \\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=2x\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\).\n3. We start with the right hand side of the identity and note that \\(1+\\tan^{2}(\\theta)=\\sec^{2}(\\theta)\\). From this point, we use the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities to rewrite \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sec(\\theta)\\) in terms of \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\): \\[\\frac{2\\tan(\\theta)}{1+\\tan^{2}(\\theta)} = \\frac{2\\tan(\\theta)}{\\sec^{2}(\\theta)}=\\frac{2\\left(\\frac{\\sin( \\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\cos^{2}(\\theta)}}=2 \\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\\cos^{2}(\\theta)\\] \\[= 2\\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\\cos(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=\\sin(2\\theta)\\]\n\nDocument 5:\n----\nso \\(G(y)=F(t)+C\\). Now we solve this equation for \\(y\\).\n### First Order Differential Equations\nOf course, there are a few places this ideal description could go wrong: we need to be able to find the antiderivatives \\(G\\) and \\(F\\), and we need to solve the final equation for \\(y\\). The upshot is that the solutions to the original differential equation are the constant solutions, if any, and all functions \\(y\\) that satisfy \\(G(y)=F(t)+C\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.1.9** Consider the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=ky\\). When \\(k>0\\), this describes certain simple cases of population growth: it says that the change in the population \\(y\\) is proportional to the population. The underlying assumption is that each organism in the current population reproduces at a fixed rate, so the larger the population the more new organisms are produced. While this is too simple to model most real populations, it is useful in some cases over a limited time. When \\(k<0\\), the differential equation describes a quantity that decreases in proportion to the current value; this can be used to model radioactive decay.\nThe constant solution is \\(y(t)=0\\); of course this will not be the solution to any interesting initial value problem. For the non-constant solutions, we proceed much as before:\n\n\n",

For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=6\\). In light of Definition 11.8, we can find the \\(\\theta\\) we're after by converting the point with rectangular coordinates \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) to polar form \\((r,\\theta)\\) where \\(r=\\|\\vec{v}\\|>0\\). From Section 11.4, we have \\(\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{-3\\sqrt{3}}{3}=-\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) is a point in Quadrant IV, \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant IV angle. Hence, we pick \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). We may check our answer by verifying \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle=6\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3 }\\right),\\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\).\n3. 1. Since we are given the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\), we'll use the formula \\(\\hat{v}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\right)\\vec{v}\\). For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\), we have \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\hat{v}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). 2. We know from our work above that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\), so to find \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\), we need only find \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|=5-2\\sqrt{5}\\). 3. In the expression \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\), notice that the arithmetic on the vectors comes first, then the magnitude. Hence, our first step is to find the component form of the vector \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\). We get \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle-2\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|=\\|\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{65}\\). 4. To find \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\), we first need \\(\\hat{w}\\). Using the formula \\(\\hat{w}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\vec{w}\\) along with \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{5}\\), which we found the in the previous problem, we get \\(\\hat{w}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{5}},-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5},- \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{ 5}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{25}+\\frac{20}{25}}=\\sqrt{1}=1\\).\nThe process exemplified by number 1 in Example 11.8.4 above by which we take information about the magnitude and direction of a vector and find the component form of a vector is called **resolving** a vector into its components. As an application of this process, we revisit Example 11.8.1 below.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 11.9.2**.: Find the angle between the following pairs of vectors.\n1. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle-\\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle\\)\n2. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\)\n3. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,1\\right\\rangle\\)\n**Solution.** We use the formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\) from Theorem 11.24 in each case below.\n1. We have \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle- \\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle=-3\\sqrt{3}-3\\sqrt{3}=-6\\sqrt{3}\\).

For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\), we find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle =10-10=0\\). Hence, it doesn't matter what \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) are,2\\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|} \\right)=\\arccos(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Footnote 2: Note that there is no ‘zero product property’ for the dot product since neither \\(\\vec{v}\\) nor \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\vec{0}\\), yet \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\n3. We find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 2,1 \\right\\rangle=6-4=2\\). Also \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{5\\sqrt{5}}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2 5}\\right)\\). Since \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\) isn't the cosine of one of the common angles, we leave our answer as \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\right)\\).\nThe vectors \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\) in Example 11.9.2 are called **orthogonal** and we write \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\), because the angle between them is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians \\(=90^{\\circ}\\). Geometrically, when orthogonal vectors are sketched with the same initial point, the lines containing the vectors are perpendicular.\nWe state the relationship between orthogonal vectors and their dot product in the following theorem.\n**Theorem 11.25**.: **The Dot Product Detects Orthogonality:** Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors.

We can check our answers by squaring them and showing that we get \\(z=-2+2i\\sqrt{3}\\).\n2. Proceeding as above, we get \\(z=-16=16\\mathrm{cis}(\\pi)\\). With \\(r=16\\), \\(\\theta=\\pi\\) and \\(n=4\\), we get the four fourth roots of \\(z\\) to be \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(0)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(1)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(2)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{3}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(3)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). Converting these to rectangular form gives \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(w_{1}=-\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(w_{2}=-\\sqrt{2}-i\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}=\\sqrt{2}-i\\sqrt{2}\\).\n3. For \\(z=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), we have \\(z=2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). With \\(r=2\\), \\(\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(n=3\\) the usual computations yield \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)\\), \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{12}\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{ cis}\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{2}=\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\right)\\). If we were to convert these to rectangular form, we would need to use either the Sum and Difference Identities in Theorem 10.16 or the Half-Angle Identities in Theorem 10.19 to evaluate \\(w_{0}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\). Since we are not explicitly told to do so, we leave this as a good, but messy, exercise.\n4. To find the five fifth roots of \\(1\\), we write \\(1=1\\mathrm{cis}(0)\\). We have \\(r=1\\), \\(\\theta=0\\) and \\(n=5\\). Since \\(\\sqrt[5]{1}=1\\), the roots are \\(w_{0}=\\mathrm{cis}(0)=1\\), \\(w_{1}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{3}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{5}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{4}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{8\\pi}{5}\\right)\\). The situation here is even graver than in the previous example, since we have not developed any identities to help us determine the cosine or sine of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\). At this stage, we could approximate our answers using a calculator, and we leave this as an exercise.\n\nDocument 5:\n----\n3. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,1\\right\\rangle\\)\n**Solution.** We use the formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\) from Theorem 11.24 in each case below.\n1. We have \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle- \\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle=-3\\sqrt{3}-3\\sqrt{3}=-6\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=\\sqrt{36}=6\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{3})^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{4}=2\\), \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-6\\sqrt{3}}{12}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}} {2}\\right)=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\).\n2. For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\), we find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle =10-10=0\\). Hence, it doesn't matter what \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) are,2\\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|} \\right)=\\arccos(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Footnote 2: Note that there is no ‘zero product property’ for the dot product since neither \\(\\vec{v}\\) nor \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\vec{0}\\), yet \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\n3. We find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 2,1 \\right\\rangle=6-4=2\\). Also \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{5\\sqrt{5}}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2 5}\\right)\\). Since \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\) isn't the cosine of one of the common angles, we leave our answer as \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\right)\\).\nThe vectors \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\) in Example 11.9.2 are called **orthogonal** and we write \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\), because the angle between them is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians \\(=90^{\\circ}\\). Geometrically, when orthogonal vectors are sketched with the same initial point, the lines containing the vectors are perpendicular.\nWe state the relationship between orthogonal vectors and their dot product in the following theorem.\n**Theorem 11.25**.: **The Dot Product Detects Orthogonality:** Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors. Then \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\) if and only if \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\nTo prove Theorem 11.25, we first assume \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero vectors with \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\). By definition, the angle between \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). By Theorem 11.23, \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). Conversely, if \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) are nonzero vectors and \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\), then Theorem 11.24 gives \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)= \\arccos\\left(\\frac{0}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)=\\arccos(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\). We can use Theorem 11.25 in the following example to provide a different proof about the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines.3\n\n\n",
