Substitute the initial condition y(1) = 1 into the general solution to find the constant of integration: 1 = (2/3)(1)^(3/2) + C. This simplifies to 1 = 2/3 + C, so C = 1/3.\n\n6. Substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get y(t) = (2/3)t^(3/2) + 1/3.\n\n7. Finally, evaluate y(4) by plugging in t = 4 into the equation: y(4) = (2/3)(4)^(3/2) + 1/3 = (2/3)(8) + 1/3 = 16/3 + 1/3 = 17/3. \n\nTherefore, y(4) = 17/3.\n"]}]}

The Taylor series expansion for $\\cos(x)$ is $\\cos(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\cdots$. Substituting $x^2$ into this series, we get $\\cos(x^2) = 1 - \\frac{x^4}{2!} + \\frac{(x^4)^2}{4!} - \\frac{(x^4)^3}{6!} + \\cdots$.\n\n4. Now, substitute these expansions into the original expression: $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{e^\\frac{x^4}{2}-\\cos(x^2)}{x^4} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{(1 + \\frac{x^4}{2} + \\frac{(x^4)^2}{2! \\cdot 2} + \\frac{(x^4)^3}{3! \\cdot 2^2} + \\cdots) - (1 - \\frac{x^4}{2!} + \\frac{(x^4)^2}{4!} - \\frac{(x^4)^3}{6!} + \\cdots)}{x^4}$.\n\n5. Simplify the expression: $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{1 + \\frac{x^4}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{2! \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^4}{3! \\cdot 2^2} + \\cdots - 1 + \\frac{x^4}{2!} - \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\frac{x^4}{6!} - \\cdots}{x^4}$.\n\n6. Cancel out the terms and simplify further: $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{x^4}{2} + \\frac{x^4}{2! \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^4}{3! \\cdot 2^2} + \\frac{x^4}{4! \\cdot 2^3} + \\cdots + \\frac{x^4}{2!} - \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\frac{x^4}{6!} - \\cdots}{x^4}$.\n\n7. As $x$ approaches 0, all terms with $x$ in the numerator will tend to 0, except for the constant terms. Therefore, the limit simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\n8. Thus, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{e^\\frac{x^4}{2}-\\cos(x^2)}{x^4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n"]}]}
