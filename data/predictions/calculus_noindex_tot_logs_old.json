The divergence theorem states that $\\iint_{\\Sigma} \\textbf{F} \\cdot d\\textbf{S} = \\iiint_V \\nabla \\cdot \\textbf{F} dV$, where $\\textbf{F} = (x^3, y^3, z^3)$ and $V$ is the region enclosed by the ellipsoid.\n\n5. The divergence of $\\textbf{F}$ is $\\nabla \\cdot \\textbf{F} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^3) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^3) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(z^3) = 3x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2$.\n\n6. Substituting the divergence into the divergence theorem, we have $\\iint_{\\Sigma} x^3 dy*dz +y^3 dz*dx+z^3 dx*dy = \\iiint_V 3x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2 dV$.\n\n7. In spherical coordinates, $dV = \\rho^2 \\sin(\\phi) d\\rho d\\phi d\\theta$, where $\\rho = 2$ is the radius of the ellipsoid.\n\n8. The triple integral becomes $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\int_0^2 3(2\\cos(\\phi))^2 \\rho^2 \\sin(\\phi) d\\rho d\\phi d\\theta$.\n\n9. Solving the triple integral, we get $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\int_0^2 12\\rho^2 \\cos^2(\\phi) \\sin(\\phi) d\\rho d\\phi d\\theta = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\frac{32\\pi}{3} \\approx 33.510$.\n"]}]}
