        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to divide a set of 8 elements into 5 non-empty ordered subsets?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 3.4 Sets: When order doesn't matter\nAfter receiving numerous complaints about the length of its lines, the ice cream shop decided to reward their customers with an _Ice Cream for a Year_ contest. This contest allows 4 people to win free ice cream for a year! The seven students in the set \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) eagerly enter, along with 100 other people. Out of the 107 entrants, how many ways are there to choose 4 winners? All winners receive the same prize.\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.1, where **order does not matter** and **repeats are not allowed**. We can solve problems of this type with the binomial coefficient formula from Section 1.2.3.\n**Theorem 3.4.1**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of subsets of size \\(k\\) in a set of size \\(n\\) is_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\\]\n_More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: We already proved this in Lemma 1.2.6. Here we repeat the proof from Method 1, using the vocabulary of sets. By Theorem 3.3.9, the number of _ordered_ subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). However, that counts each unordered subset \\(k!\\) times, since \\(k!\\) is the number of permutations of \\(k\\) objects (Theorem 3.3.4). Hence, by the division principle, the number of unordered subsets of size \\(k\\) is\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nUsing Theorem 3.4.1, we can complete the upper-left entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order does not matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.4.2**.: The number of ways to choose 2 fruits from 5 to bring to work on the same day is\n\\[\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!\\cdot 3!}=\\frac{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{2\\cdot 1 \\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=5\\cdot 2=10.\\]\n**Example 3.4.3**.: How many ways are there to select the top 25 NCAA DI football teams (of which there are 128) without ranking them?\nThis is the number of (unordered) subsets of size 25, giving \\(\\binom{128}{25}=\\frac{128!}{25!(128-25)!}=\\frac{128!}{25!103!}\\)\n**Example 3.4.4**.: The number of ways to pick 4 winners out of 107 entrants for the _Ice Cream for a Year_ contest is \\(\\binom{107}{4}=\\frac{107!}{4!\\cdot 103!}=5,160,610\\).\nChoosing the four winners in Example 3.4.4 is the same as eliminating the 103 people who did not win. So the number of ways to choose 103 people out of 107 gives the same answer. This leads us to the following corollary, which is often used to simplify problems.\n**Corollary 3.4.5**.: _These two binomial coefficients are equal: \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\)._\nSurprisingly, the formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) can also be useful in counting certain sequences or strings.\n**Example 3.4.6**.: How many binary strings (from the alphabet \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) have exactly \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-k\\) ones? To form such a binary string, we simply have to choose \\(k\\) positions for the 0's, out of \\(n\\) possible positions. This is the same as choosing an _unordered_ subset of \\(k\\) of the positions in the string (even though the string itself is ordered). Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n\n\n",

Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\frac{7!}{2!3!2!}=210.\\]\nIn the next definition, we generalize Definition 2.9.1, by replacing a set partition by an _ordered set partition_.\n**Definition 4.6.2**.: An **ordered set partition** of a set \\(S\\) is a collection of non-empty subsets \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\) of \\(S\\), such that the intersection of any two of them is trivial and such that the union of all of them is \\(S\\).\nIn other words, the ordered set partition separates the elements of \\(S\\) into subsets \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\) with no overlap. The sets \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\) are called the **blocks** of the ordered set partition.\n**Theorem 4.6.3**.: _The number of ordered set partitions of an \\(n\\)-element set \\(S\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) is the multinomial coefficient_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdots k_{m}!}.\\]\nProof.: We count the number of ordered set partitions of a set \\(S\\) of size \\(n\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) as follows. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\). Out of the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements, there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{(n-k_{1})!}{k_{2}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2})}\\) ways to choose the next block \\(B_{2}\\). If \\(m\\geq 3\\), there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}!}=\\frac{(n-k_{1}-k_{2})!}{k_{3}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2}-k_ {3})!}\\) ways to choose the third block \\(B_{3}\\), and so on. Multiplying these together, all the factorials cancel except for \\(n!\\) in the numerator and the terms \\(k_{1}!,\\ldots,k_{m}!\\) in the denominator. The result follows.\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\). The number of ways we can do this is\n\\[\\binom{11}{4,1,2,4}=\\frac{11!}{4!1!2!4!}=34650.\\]\nIn the next remark, we compare anagrams with ordered set partitions. We will use this to prove Theorem 4.5.7.\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\n\n\n",

(For example, there are 62 options for the second position, since there are 52 letters once both cases are accounted for and 10 digits. We then multiply these possibilities together, since each choice is independent of the others. Therefore, we have\n\\[26\\times 62^{5}\\times 2\\times 29^{5}\\times 10=9\\,771\\,287\\,250\\,890\\,863\\,360\\]\ntotal possible usernames.\n### 2.2 Permutations\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\nTo generalize the preceding example, we now introduce permutations. To do so, let \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(n\\) be a positive integer. An \\(X\\)-string \\(s=x_{1}x_{2}\\ldots x_{n}\\) is called\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c}  & & & & & & & & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\\\  & D & D & D & D & D & & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\\\  & L & L & L & L & L & . & * & * & * & * & * & * & \\\\ U & U & U & U & U & U & @ & L & L & L & L & D & \\\\ \\hline\n26 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 2 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 10 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2.4: String Template\na **permutation** if all \\(n\\) characters used in \\(s\\) are distinct. Clearly, the existence of an \\(X\\)-permutation of length \\(n\\) requires that \\(|X|\\geq n\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nSolution.Both sides count the number of \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\)-strings of length \\(n\\), the right hand side first partitioning them according to positions in the string which are not \\(2\\). (For instance, if \\(6\\) of the positions are not \\(2\\), we must first choose those \\(6\\) positions in \\(C(n,6)\\) ways and then there are \\(2^{6}\\) ways to fill in those six positions by choosing either a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\) for each position.)\n**Example 2.20**.: Explain why, for each non-negative integer \\(n\\),\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n}=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{ n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nSolution.Both sides count the number of bit strings of length \\(2n\\) with half the bits being \\(0^{\\prime}\\)s, with the right side first partitioning them according to the number of \\(1^{\\prime}\\)s occurring in the first \\(n\\) positions of the string. Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\nImagine the folders placed in a row. Then there are \\(17\\) gaps between them. Of these gaps, choose three and place a divider in each. Then this choice divides the folders into four non-empty sets. The first goes to Audrey, the second to Bart, etc. Thus the answer is \\(C(17,3)\\). In Figure 2.22, we illustrate this scheme with Audrey receiving \\(6\\) folders, Bart getting \\(1\\), Cecilia \\(4\\) and Darren \\(7\\).\n**Example 2.23**.: Suppose we redo the preceding problem but drop the restriction that each of the four employees gets at least one folder. Now how many ways can the distribution be made?\nFigure 2.22: Distributing Identical Objects into Distinct Cells\nSolution.The solution involves a \"trick\" of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by _artificially_ inflating everyone's allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get 7 folders, we say that he will get 8. Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by 4, one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of \\(22=18+4\\) folders. Again, choose 3 gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less--and may be zero. So the answer is \\(C(21,3)\\).\n**Example 2.24**.: Again we have the same problem as before, but now we want to count the number of distributions where only Audrey and Cecilia are guaranteed to get a folder. Bart and Darren are allowed to get zero folders. Now the trick is to artificially inflate Bart and Darren's allocation, but leave the numbers for Audrey and Cecilia as is. So the answer is \\(C(19,3)\\).\n**Example 2.25**.: Here is a reformulation of the preceding discussion expressed in terms of integer solutions of inequalities.\n\n\n",

And of course, when \\(n\\) is even, these are exactly the same family.\nOn the other hand, for Example 16.6, there are many extremal families, since for every complementary pair of sets, either member can be selected.\nWe close this brief tasting of extremal set theory with a real classic.\n**Theorem 16.8** (Erdos, Ko, Rado).: _Let \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) be positive integers with \\(n\\geq 2k\\). Then the maximum size of a family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of subsets of \\([n]\\) subject to the restrictions that (1) \\(A\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset\\) for all \\(A,B\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), and (2) \\(|A|=k\\) for all \\(A\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), is \\(\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\)._\nProof.: For the lower bound, consider the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of all \\(k\\) element subset of \\([n]\\) that contain 1.\nFor the upper bound, let \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be a family of subsets of \\([n]\\) satisfying the two constraints. We show that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\). To accomplish this, we consider a circle in the Euclidean plane with \\(n\\) points \\(p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\) equally spaced points around its circumference. Then there are \\(n!\\) different ways (one for each permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\([n]\\)) to place the integers in \\([n]\\) at the points in \\(\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\}\\) in one to one manner.\nFor each permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\([n]\\), let \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) denote the subfamily of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consisting of all sets \\(S\\) from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) whose elements occur in a consecutive block around the circle. Then let \\(t=\\sum_{\\sigma}|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|\\).\nOur first claim is that \\(t\\leq kn!\\). To prove this, let \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation and suppose that \\(|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|=s\\geq 1\\). Then the union of the sets from \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) is a set of points that form a consecutive block of points on the circle. Note that since \\(n\\geq 2k\\), this block does not encompass the entire circle. Accordingly there is a set \\(S\\) whose elements are the first \\(k\\) in a clockwise sense within this block. Since each other set in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) represents a clockwise shift of one of more positions, it follows immediately that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq k\\). Since there are \\(n!\\) permutations, the claim follows.\nWe now claim that for each set \\(S\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), there are exactly \\(nk!(n-k)!\\) permutations \\(\\sigma\\) for which \\(S\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\). Note that there are \\(n\\) positions around the circle and each can be used as the first point in a block of \\(k\\) consecutive positions in which the elements of \\(S\\) can be placed. Then there are \\(k!\\) ways to order the elements of \\(S\\) and \\((n-k)!\\) ways to order the remaining elements. This proves our claim.\nTo complete the proof of the theorem, we note that we have\n\\[|\\mathcal{F}|nk!(n-k)!\\leq t\\leq kn!,\\]\nand this implies that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|le\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThus in particular we have \\(D_{n+1,1}=D_{0}D_{n}\\), \\(D_{n+1,2}=D_{1}D_{n-1}\\), and so on. Plugging these formulas into Equation 6.8 above, we obtain\n\\[D_{n+1}=D_{0}D_{n}+D_{1}D_{n-1}+\\cdots+D_{n}D_{0}\\]\nas desired. Therefore, \\(D_{n}\\) satisfies the same recursion as the Catalan numbers, so \\(D_{n}=C_{n}\\) for all \\(n\\).\n**Theorem 6.6.4**.: _A closed form formula for the \\(n\\)th Catalan number is_\n\\[C_{n}=\\binom{2n}{n}-\\binom{2n}{n+1}=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}.\\] (6.9)\nTheorem 6.6.4 will be proven later in Section 7.6. It is not hard to check that the two formulas for \\(C_{n}\\) in (6.9) are the same.\nCatalan numbers do not just count Dyck paths; in fact, there are 214 different known combinatorial descriptions of the Catalan numbers2! Let's consider some descriptions in the case \\(n=3\\).\nFootnote 2: All of these descriptions can be found in the book “Catalan Numbers” by Richard Stanley.\n**Example 6.6.5**.: The fact that \\(C_{3}=5\\) is equivalent to there being 5 ways to:\n1. put parentheses around 4 letters \\[((xy)z)w,\\ (x(yz))w,\\ (xy)(zw),\\ x((yz)w),\\ x(y(zw));\\]\n2. divide a convex pentagon into triangles;\n3. tile a stair of height 3 with 3 rectangles;\n4. arrange the numbers \\(\\{1,\\ldots,6\\}\\) in a \\(2\\times 3\\) grid so that each row and each column is increasing;\n5. pair the vertices of a hexagon so that the line segments joining paired vertices do not intersect;\n6. draw a rooted binary tree with 4 leaves such that every vertex has either 0 or 2 children (we will see more about trees in Chapter 9).\n7. write down a sequence \\((a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{6})\\) of 1's and \\(-1\\)'s such that each partial sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{j}\\) is nonnegative and the entire sum \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{6}\\) is 0. \\[(1,1,1,-1,-1,-1),(1,1,-1,1,-1,-1),(1,1,-1,1,-1),(1,-1,1,1,-1),(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1)\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.9 Set partitions, the division principle, and equivalence relations\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's short video lecture.\nEquivalence relations and partitions\n#### Set partitions and the division principle\nThe division principle is the most difficult to state in terms of set theory. To do this, we define a _set partition_, which is a a helpful way to organize sets.\n**Definition 2.9.1**.: Let \\(A\\) be a finite set. A non-empty subset \\(B\\) of \\(A\\) is called a **block**. A **set partition** of a finite set \\(A\\) is a set of blocks \\(\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) of \\(A\\) such that:\n1. the blocks are disjoint, that is, \\(B_{i}\\cap B_{j}=\\emptyset\\) for all \\(i\\neq j\\); and\n2. the union of the blocks is \\(A\\), that is \\(B_{1}\\cup B_{2}\\cup\\cdots\\cup B_{k}=A\\).\n**Example 2.9.2**.: The following is a set partition of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}\\):\n\\[\\{\\{1,3,4\\},\\{2,6\\},\\{5,7\\}\\}.\\]\nThe division principle arises when we split a set into blocks of equal sizes. It can be stated as follows.\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n\n\n",

Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green.

The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n**Example 2.32**.: How many different rearrangements of the string:\nMItCHELIKELLERANDWILLIAMTTROTTERAREGENIUSES!!\nare possible if all letters and characters must be used?\nSolution.To answer this question, we note that there are a total of 45 characters distributed as follows: 3 A's, 1 C, 1 D, 7 E's, 1 G, 1 H, 4 I's, 1 K, 5 L's, 2 M's, 2 N's, 1 O, 4 R's, 2 S's, 6 T's, 1 U, 1 W, and 2 !'s. So the number of rearrangements is\n\\[\\frac{45!}{3!1!1!7!1!1!4!1!1!5!2!2!1!1!4!2!6!1!1!2!}.\\]\nJust as with binomial coefficients and the Binomial Theorem, the multinomial coefficients arise in the expansion of powers of a multinomial:\n**Theorem 2.33** (Multinomial Theorem).: _Let \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{r}\\) be nonzero real numbers with \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{r}x_{i}\\neq 0\\). Then for every \\(n\\in\\mathbf{N}_{0}\\),_\n\\[(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{r})^{n}=\\sum_{k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{r}=n}\\binom{n}{k_{ 1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{r}}x_{1}^{k_{1}}x_{2}^{k_{2}}\\cdots x_{r}^{k_{r}}.\\]\n**Example 2.34**.: What is the coefficient of \\(x^{99}y^{60}z^{14}\\) in \\((2x^{3}+y-z^{2})^{100}\\)? What about \\(x^{99}y^{61}z^{13}\\)?\nSolution.By the Multinomial Theorem, the expansion of \\((2x^{3}+y-z^{2})^{100}\\) has terms of the form\n\\[\\binom{100}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3}}(2x^{3})^{k_{1}}y^{k_{2}}(-z^{2})^{k_{3}}=\\binom{ 100}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3}}2^{k_{1}}x^{3k_{1}}y^{k_{2}}(-1)^{k_{3}}z^{2k_{3}}.\\]\nThe \\(x^{99}y^{60}z^{14}\\) arises when \\(k_{1}=33\\), \\(k_{2}=60\\), and \\(k_{3}=7\\), so it must have coefficient\n\\[-\\binom{100}{33,60,7}2^{33}.\\]\nFor \\(x^{99}y^{61}z^{13}\\), the exponent on \\(z\\) is odd, which cannot arise in the expansion of \\((2x^{3}+y-z^{2})^{100}\\), so the coefficient is \\(0\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different different bouquets of 10 balloons are there that contain at least one balloon of each color? In this case, \\(m=10\\) and \\(n=6\\). Hence the number of ways is \\(\\binom{10-1}{6-1}=\\binom{9}{5}\\).\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n**Example 3.5.13**.: When \\(k=5\\) and \\(n=4\\), for the multiset \\(\\{A_{1},A_{1},A_{3},A_{4},A_{4}\\}\\), person \\(A_{1}\\) receives 2 pennies, person \\(A_{2}\\) receives 0 pennies, person \\(A_{3}\\) receives 1 penny, and person \\(A_{4}\\) receives 2 pennies. As another example, if person \\(A_{2}\\) receives all the pennies, then the multiset is \\(\\{A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2}\\}\\).\nThe number of ways to distribute \\(k=5\\) pennies to \\(n=4\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{4+5-1}{5}=\\binom{8}{5}=56\\) ways.\nA further variant of distribution problems is to count _compositions_, meaning lists of nonnegative integers with a fixed length and sum.\n\n\n",

These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right. Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n**Example 5.6.11**.: If 17 people are seated in a circle of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 6 chairs are filled with people.\n_Answer._ The 3 empty chairs partition the circle into \\(n=3\\) \"boxes\" of consecutively filled chairs. Let \\(k+1=6\\), so \\(k=5\\). Since \\(17>15=5\\cdot 3=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=6\\) objects, which are consecutively filled chairs.\nOne of the most fun applications of the pigeonhole principle is to _Ramsey theory_. Here we give one example of this.\n**Example 5.6.12**.: Consider the complete graph \\(K_{6}\\) with 6 vertices (every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge). If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n### Exercises\n1. _Counting Rocks!_ If 5 people pick up 11 rocks in total, show that someone picked up at least 3.\n2. _Counting Socks!_ If a drawer contains 16 black and 16 white socks, how many do you need to pick in order to have a matching pair?\n3.

Each employee is assigned one of the \\(k\\) colors. Making an assignment of the employees to the jobs is the same as making a \\(k\\)-coloring of \\(G\\). If the number of employees is less than the chromatic number \\(C(G)\\), then there is no way to create a proper vertex-coloring of a graph. However, for any \\(k\\geq C(G)\\), we want to find a way to represent the number of different vertex-colorings. In fact, we can do such a thing with a polynomial. Now we want to study the number of ways to \\(k\\)-color a labeled graph.\n**Theorem 12.5.1**.: _If \\(G\\) is a labeled graph with \\(n\\) vertices, there is a polynomial \\(P_{G}(x)\\) having the property that \\(P_{G}(k)\\) is the number of ways to \\(k\\)-color the vertices of \\(G\\) for any positive integer \\(k\\)._\nWhat is amazing about this theorem is that the number of colors can be as large as we want, including much larger than the number of coefficients of the polynomial.\nThe chromatic polynomial is not a generating function because the number of \\(k\\)-colorings is the value \\(P_{G}(k)\\) rather than its \\(k\\)th coefficient.\n**Example 12.5.2**.: If \\(G\\) is the labeled complete graph on \\(n\\) vertices, then \\(P_{G}(x)=x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n+1)\\).\n**Example 12.5.3**.: If \\(G\\) is the empty labeled graph on \\(n\\) vertices, then \\(P_{G}(x)=x^{n}\\).\n**Example 12.5.4**.: If \\(G\\) is the labeled path graph \\(P_{n}\\), then \\(P_{G}(x)=x(x-1)^{n-1}\\).\n**Theorem 12.5.5**.: _If \\(T\\) is a labeled tree with \\(n\\) vertices, then \\(P_{T}(x)=x(x-1)^{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: There are \\(k\\) choices for the color of the first labeled vertex. We now consider the vertices adjacent to this first one. Since these vertices are adjacent to the first labeled vertex, the color used for the first labeled vertex is not an option. So there are \\(k-1\\) choices for the color of any vertex adjacent to the first labeled vertex. We continue in this fashion. We can color the starting vertex with any of the \\(k\\) colors. Then, each branch can be colored with any of the \\((k-1)\\) colors remaining. The branches off those vertices are not connected to the starting vertex anymore, so while one color is removed, the color of the starting vertex is added back. Thus, there will be \\(k-1\\) colors left at all times for the \\(n-1\\) vertices remaining.\n**Theorem 12.5.6**.: _Let \\(G\\) be a labeled graph and \\(\\alpha\\) be an edge of \\(G\\). Let \\(G_{\\ominus\\alpha}\\) be the labeled graph obtained by deleting \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(G_{\\otimes\\alpha}\\) be the labeled graph obtained by contracting the edge \\(\\alpha\\). Then_\n\\[p_{G}(x)=p_{G_{\\ominus\\alpha}}(x)-p_{G_{\\otimes\\alpha}}(x).\\]\nProof.: Let \\(v_{1},v_{2}\\) be the two vertices of \\(G\\) that are connected by the edge \\(\\alpha\\). If we consider the graph \\(G_{\\ominus\\alpha}\\), we have two disjoint methods of creating a \\(k\\)-coloring. The first method is a \\(k\\)-coloring where \\(v_{1}\\) and \\(v_{2}\\) are the same color (since they are no longer adjacent), and the number of these \\(k\\)-coverings is \\(p_{G_{\\otimes\\alpha}}(k)\\). The second method is a \\(k\\)-coloring where \\(v_{1}\\) and \\(v_{2}\\) are different colors, and the number of these \\(k\\)-colorings is \\(p_{G}(k)\\). Thus, \\(p_{G_{\\ominus\\alpha}}(k)=p_{G}(k)+p_{G_{\\otimes\\alpha}}(k)\\). Thus \\(p_{G}(k)=p_{G_{\\ominus\\alpha}}(k)-p_{G_{\\otimes\\alpha}}(k)\\).\n**Example 12.5.7**.: Let \\(G\\) be the labeled graph \\(C_{4}\\). Then \\(G_{\\ominus\\alpha}\\) is a labeled \\(P_{4}\\) and \\(G_{\\otimes\\alpha}\\) is a labeled \\(C_{3}\\). The chromatic polynomial for the labeled \\(P_{4}\\)\n\\[p_{P_{4}}(x)=x(x-1)^{3}=x^{4}-3x^{3}+3x^{2}-x.\\]\nThe chromatic polynomial for the labeled \\(C_{3}\\) is\n\\[p_{C_{3}}(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)=x^{3}-3x^{2}+2x.\\]\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nColoring the edges of a complete graph with n vertices in 2 colors (red and blue), what is the smallest n that guarantees there is either a 4-clique in red or a 5-clique in blue?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 10.4.9**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(k\\) colors \\(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{k}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n**Ramsey's theorem** says that the Ramsey number \\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is always finite; that is, there does exist some sufficiently large \\(n\\) for which the statement is true. But what is the minimum such number \\(n=R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\)? This is in general an unsolved problem, and the study of computing the Ramsey numbers is called _Ramsey theory_, and is one of a large class of optimization problems in graph theory involving coloring graphs.\n### Exercises\n1.

We start with a classical example.\n**Example 10.4.1**.: Six people walk into a room; some of the people know each other already and others do not. Prove that either some three of them all mutually know each other, or some three of them all mutually do not know each other.\nTo get a handle on the above problem, we can first model it as a graph theory problem; consider a graph on \\(6\\) vertices that represent the people, and where each pair of people is connected either by a solid or dashed edge according to whether they know each other or not, as shown:\nIn the above graph, notice that the vertices numbered \\(3,4,6\\) all mutually do not know each other. Their induced subgraph is a smaller complete graph \\(K_{3}\\), with all its edges the same \"color\" (where the two colors are solid and dashed in this case, but any two colors would work). To state our problem more precisely in terms of graphs, we make the following two definitions.\n**Definition 10.4.2**.: An \\(m\\)**-clique** in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to \\(K_{m}\\).\n**Definition 10.4.3**.: Suppose a graph \\(G\\) has every edge assigned a color. A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\).

Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 5.7 Additional problems for Chapter 5\n1.

Suppose that 80 chairs are arranged in a _row_. Prove that if 75 people sit in this row of 80 chairs, then there are at least 13 consecutively filled chairs.\n7. 1. Look up the statement of the Well-Ordering Principle. Explain how it is similar to and different from induction. 2. Prove the Well-Ordering principle using only strong induction and the axiom that 0 is smaller than every positive integer, as follows. 1.

For any \\(a\\geq 2\\), generalize Exercise 12b from Section 4.2 to show \\((x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{a})^{p}\\equiv x_{1}^{p}+\\cdots+x_{a}^{p}\\bmod p\\). 2. Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9. In this problem, we will prove Fermat's Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument. 1. Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nHow many ways are there to arrange 9 people in a line such that no one is standing in their correct position?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1. How many three-digit positive integers are even?\n2. _Counting Rocks!_ You have 6 distinct rocks and 2 identical buckets. How many different ways can you put 3 rocks in each bucket?\n3. In how many ways can you attach the letters of MATH in some order to a piece of string? (If you turn the string over so that the order of the letters is reversed, it is not considered a different possibility. So for instance, MATH and HTAM are considered the same ordering.)\n4. There are 10 people in a dance class. How many ways can they pair off into 5 pairs of dance partners? (Gender does not matter in making the pairings.)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nProof.: By Theorem 3.2.9, there are \\(n\\) choices for the first object, then \\(n-1\\) choices for the second object, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on until there is only one 1 choice remaining for the \\(n\\)th object. So there are \\(n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=n!\\) permutations in total.\n**Remark 3.3.5**.: If there are 0 objects, then there is only one way to arrange them (do nothing). This can be thought of as the \"empty sequence\" or \"empty string\". Therefore, we set \\(0!=1\\).\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of ordered subsets of size \\(k\\) from a set with \\(n\\) elements is_\n\\[n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\] (3.1)\n_More generally, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: An ordered subset of size \\(k\\) is a sequence of length \\(k\\) chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) in which no two entries are equal. There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\n\n",

Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2. We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 5.7 Additional problems for Chapter 5\n1.

If 30 numbers are chosen from 1 to 82, then show that there is a group of at least 5 of them such that the difference between any two numbers in this group is less than 12.\n5. Suppose that 64 chairs are arranged in a circle. Prove that if 57 people sit in this circle of 64 chairs, then there are at least 9 consecutively filled chairs.\n6. Suppose that 80 chairs are arranged in a _row_. Prove that if 75 people sit in this row of 80 chairs, then there are at least 13 consecutively filled chairs.\n7. 1. Look up the statement of the Well-Ordering Principle. Explain how it is similar to and different from induction. 2. Prove the Well-Ordering principle using only strong induction and the axiom that 0 is smaller than every positive integer, as follows. 1. Let \\(P(n)\\) be the statement that any subset of the natural numbers containing \\(n\\) has a least element.\n2. Prove \\(P(0)\\). 3. Prove that if \\(P(0),P(1),\\ldots,P(n)\\) are all true, then \\(P(n+1)\\) is true.\n8. Let \\(p\\) be a prime. Fermat's Little Theorem states that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), for any positive integer \\(a\\). For example, when \\(p=7\\): then \\(7\\) divides \\(1^{7}-1\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(2^{7}-2\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(3^{7}-3\\); etc. 1. For any \\(a\\geq 2\\), generalize Exercise 12b from Section 4.2 to show \\((x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{a})^{p}\\equiv x_{1}^{p}+\\cdots+x_{a}^{p}\\bmod p\\). 2. Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9. In this problem, we will prove Fermat's Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument. 1. Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\n\n",

Here is the way we can use this. Suppose we want to prove \\(F=G\\) where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are both mathematical formulas. Then we simply have to find a collection of objects such that both \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are the answer to the question \"how many are there in the collection\"?\n**Example 5.3.2**.: Suppose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers. Here is a combinatorial proof that\n\\[a\\cdot b=\\underbrace{b+b+\\cdots+b}_{a\\text{ summands}}\\]\nwhere the sum has \\(a\\) copies of \\(b\\). By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\nProof.: Note that \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players out of a team of \\(2n\\) soccer players. We will count that in another way by separating the \\(2n\\) soccer players into two groups, by putting a gold jersey on \\(n\\) of the soccer players and a green jersey on the other \\(n\\) soccer players. From the first group, we choose \\(k\\) soccer players with gold jerseys. In order to choose \\(n\\) soccer players altogether, we need to choose \\(n-k\\) soccer players with green jerseys. Symbolically,\n\\[\\underbrace{1,2,\\ldots,n}_{\\text{choose $k$}},\\ \\ \\underbrace{n+1,n+2,\\ldots,2n}_{\\text{ choose $n-k$}}.\\]\nSo there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{n-k}\\) ways to do that.\nThe choice of the number \\(k\\) was arbitrary and so we need to consider all the possible values of \\(k\\), which could be as small as \\(0\\) and as big as \\(n\\). So we need to add up the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players as \\(k\\) varies between \\(0\\) and \\(n\\). This gives us:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### Subsets\nInformally, a _subset_ is a set contained in a bigger set.\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

With this convention, graphs can be described _precisely_ with a text file:\n1. The first line of the file contains a single integer \\(n\\), the number of vertices in the graph.\n2. Each of the remaining lines of the file contains a pair of distinct integers and specifies an edge of the graph.\nFigure 1.1: Necklaces made with three colors\nWe illustrate this convention in Figure 1.2 with a text file and the diagram for the graph \\(G\\) it defines.\nMuch of the notation and terminology for graphs is quite natural.

If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\nFigure 15.1: The 16 colorings of the vertices of a square.\nby a different angle.)\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\n\n",

Typically, the number of permutations of three letters is \\(3!=6\\). However, two of the letters in ZOO are the same. After we label the two \\(O\\)'s as \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), the six permutations are:\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}&&\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_ {1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathbb{Z}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathbb{Z} .\\end{array}\\]\nHowever, the number of anagrams is half of 6, since each anagram of ZOO appears 2 times on this list. Recognizing that each row gives a different anagram, we can list the \\(6/2=3\\) anagrams of the word ZOO. They are: ZOO, OZO, and OOZ.\n**Example 4.5.3**.: The word SASSY has 20 anagrams. Typically, the number of permutations of five letters is \\(5!=120\\). In the list of these permutations, each anagram is written \\(3!=6\\) times, corresponding to the rearrangement of the three S's. So the number of anagrams is \\(5!/3!=20\\).\n**Example 4.5.4**.: How many anagrams are there for FORTCOLLINS? One approach is to say that there are 11 letters in total, but two of these are L and two of these are O. So in the list of 11! permutations of the letters, each word is written four times (the three extra times correspond to switching the locations of the two L's, switching the locations of the two O's, and switching both the two L's and the two O's). Hence the total number of anagrams is \\(11!/4\\).\n**Example 4.5.5**.: Let \\(W\\) be a binary string of length \\(n\\), having \\(k\\) zeros and \\(n-k\\) ones. Then the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) because the anagram is determined exactly by the location of the \\(k\\) zeros.\nThe same ideas from the previous examples lead to the following definition and theorem:\n**Definition 4.5.6**.: Let \\(n\\) be a natural number. Let \\(k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) be \\(m\\) positive natural numbers such that\n\\[k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}=n.\\]\nLet \\(W\\) be a word with \\(n\\) letters of \\(m\\) different types, in which the letter of type \\(i\\) appears \\(k_{i}\\) times, for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\). The multinomial coefficient\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}\\]\nis defined to be the number of anagrams of \\(W\\).\n**Theorem 4.5.7**.: _The multinomial coefficient has the following formula:_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot k_{m}!}.\\] (4.1)\nWe prove Theorem 4.5.7 in Section 4.6.\n**Example 4.5.8**.: How many anagrams are there for the word MISSISSIPPI? In this case \\(n=11\\), \\(m=4\\), \\(k_{1}=4\\) (the I's), \\(k_{2}=1\\) (the M), \\(k_{3}=2\\) (the P's) and \\(k_{4}=4\\) (the S's). So the answer is \\(11!/(4!\\cdot 1!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 4!)\\).\nExercises\n1. How many anagrams does the word BANANA have? For example, NABNAA and NANABA are two anagrams of BANANA.\n2.

(For example, there are 62 options for the second position, since there are 52 letters once both cases are accounted for and 10 digits. We then multiply these possibilities together, since each choice is independent of the others. Therefore, we have\n\\[26\\times 62^{5}\\times 2\\times 29^{5}\\times 10=9\\,771\\,287\\,250\\,890\\,863\\,360\\]\ntotal possible usernames.\n### 2.2 Permutations\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\nTo generalize the preceding example, we now introduce permutations. To do so, let \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(n\\) be a positive integer. An \\(X\\)-string \\(s=x_{1}x_{2}\\ldots x_{n}\\) is called\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c}  & & & & & & & & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\\\  & D & D & D & D & D & & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\\\  & L & L & L & L & L & . & * & * & * & * & * & * & \\\\ U & U & U & U & U & U & @ & L & L & L & L & D & \\\\ \\hline\n26 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 2 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 10 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2.4: String Template\na **permutation** if all \\(n\\) characters used in \\(s\\) are distinct.

If \\(S\\subset\\Omega\\) has size \\(k\\), then the complement \\(\\Omega-S\\) has size \\(n-k\\). If \\(k\\) is even, then \\(n-k\\) is odd and vice-versa. Each subset has exactly one complement, so we can pair each subset of even size with exactly one subset of odd size. In conclusion, when \\(n\\) is odd, there is a bijection between the set \\(A\\) (resp. \\(B\\)) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) of even (resp. odd) size taking \\(S\\) to \\(\\Omega-S\\).\nThe proof above does not work when \\(n\\) is even, so we will set up a different bijection. Here is a motivating example when \\(n=4\\) to see how this bijection works.\n**Example 5.4.11**.: Let \\(\\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\). Its subsets can be paired as follows:\nProof of Proposition 5.4.9 for \\(n\\) even (and odd).: Since \\(\\Omega\\) is nonempty, pick a distinguished element, say \\(1\\in\\Omega\\). Group the subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) into pairs where the two subsets in each pair differ only in whether they contain \\(1\\) or not. Every subset is in exactly one pair. Each pair contains one subset of even size and one subset of odd size. So the number of subsets of odd size and of even size is the same.\nAs another example of a bijective proof, we prove the \"sticks and stones\" theorem (Theorem 3.5.6) again here, using \"M&M's and toothpicks\" instead. The logic we used in Section 3.5 to prove this result is really a bijection in disguise.\n**Proposition 5.4.12**.: _Suppose \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer such that \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). Then the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\) (with repeats allowed) is_\n\\[\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.\\]\nProof.: We first find a set \\(A\\) whose size is the number of ways to choose a set of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\). To do this, let \\(A\\) be the set of cups filled with \\(k\\) M&M's, where there are \\(n\\) different possible colors of M&M's.\nNext, we find a set \\(B\\) whose size is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). Let \\(B\\) be the set of binary sequences consisting of \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-1\\) ones. Such a sequence has \\(n+k-1\\) entries total and is determined by choosing which \\(k\\) positions contain the \\(0\\)'s. So the size of \\(B\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\).\nWe need to find a bijective map between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Fix an ordering of colors, for example, rainbow order with brown at the end. An element of the set \\(A\\) is a cup of \\(k\\) colored M&M's. Given such a cup, spill the M&M's onto a plate and sort them by color, in a row.

Finally, put on color-filter goggles so that all the M&M's look grey. What we see is a row of \\(k\\) grey M&M's and \\(n-1\\) toothpicks. Write a sequence of \\(0\\)'s and \\(1\\)'s by writing a \\(0\\) for each grey M&M and writing a \\(1\\) for each toothpick.

If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n### Exercises\n1. _Counting Rocks!_ If 5 people pick up 11 rocks in total, show that someone picked up at least 3.\n2. _Counting Socks!_ If a drawer contains 16 black and 16 white socks, how many do you need to pick in order to have a matching pair?\n3.

Typically, the number of permutations of three letters is \\(3!=6\\). However, two of the letters in ZOO are the same. After we label the two \\(O\\)'s as \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), the six permutations are:\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}&&\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_ {1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{ZO}_{2}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{ZO}_{1}\\\\ \\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathbb{Z}&&\\mathsf{O}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{1}\\mathbb{Z} .\\end{array}\\]\nHowever, the number of anagrams is half of 6, since each anagram of ZOO appears 2 times on this list. Recognizing that each row gives a different anagram, we can list the \\(6/2=3\\) anagrams of the word ZOO. They are: ZOO, OZO, and OOZ.\n**Example 4.5.3**.: The word SASSY has 20 anagrams. Typically, the number of permutations of five letters is \\(5!=120\\). In the list of these permutations, each anagram is written \\(3!=6\\) times, corresponding to the rearrangement of the three S's. So the number of anagrams is \\(5!/3!=20\\).\n**Example 4.5.4**.: How many anagrams are there for FORTCOLLINS? One approach is to say that there are 11 letters in total, but two of these are L and two of these are O. So in the list of 11! permutations of the letters, each word is written four times (the three extra times correspond to switching the locations of the two L's, switching the locations of the two O's, and switching both the two L's and the two O's). Hence the total number of anagrams is \\(11!/4\\).\n**Example 4.5.5**.: Let \\(W\\) be a binary string of length \\(n\\), having \\(k\\) zeros and \\(n-k\\) ones. Then the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) because the anagram is determined exactly by the location of the \\(k\\) zeros.\nThe same ideas from the previous examples lead to the following definition and theorem:\n**Definition 4.5.6**.: Let \\(n\\) be a natural number. Let \\(k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) be \\(m\\) positive natural numbers such that\n\\[k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}=n.\\]\nLet \\(W\\) be a word with \\(n\\) letters of \\(m\\) different types, in which the letter of type \\(i\\) appears \\(k_{i}\\) times, for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\). The multinomial coefficient\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}\\]\nis defined to be the number of anagrams of \\(W\\).\n**Theorem 4.5.7**.: _The multinomial coefficient has the following formula:_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot k_{m}!}.\\] (4.1)\nWe prove Theorem 4.5.7 in Section 4.6.\n**Example 4.5.8**.: How many anagrams are there for the word MISSISSIPPI? In this case \\(n=11\\), \\(m=4\\), \\(k_{1}=4\\) (the I's), \\(k_{2}=1\\) (the M), \\(k_{3}=2\\) (the P's) and \\(k_{4}=4\\) (the S's). So the answer is \\(11!/(4!\\cdot 1!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 4!)\\).\nExercises\n1. How many anagrams does the word BANANA have? For example, NABNAA and NANABA are two anagrams of BANANA.\n2.

Show that \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2}}\\) is the familiar binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\) and show that the formula in (4.1) is the same as the formula \\(\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) found in Lemma 1.2.6 and Theorem 3.4.1.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.3.2**.: For example, the set \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\) has 6 permutations:\n\\[abc\\quad acb\\quad bac\\quad cab\\quad cba\\]\n**Example 3.3.3**.: To write down a permutation of the set \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}\\), we use sequence notation rather than string notation, since 10 has two digits. One possible permutation is:\n\\[(3,6,7,2,1,10,4,5,9,8).\\]\nRecall that \\(n!=n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\), and we pronounce the symbol \\(n!\\) as \"\\(n\\) factorial\".\n**Theorem 3.3.4**.: _The number of permutations of \\(n\\) objects is \\(n!\\)._\nProof.: By Theorem 3.2.9, there are \\(n\\) choices for the first object, then \\(n-1\\) choices for the second object, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on until there is only one 1 choice remaining for the \\(n\\)th object. So there are \\(n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=n!\\) permutations in total.\n**Remark 3.3.5**.: If there are 0 objects, then there is only one way to arrange them (do nothing). This can be thought of as the \"empty sequence\" or \"empty string\". Therefore, we set \\(0!=1\\).\n**Example 3.3.6**.: When seven students go out for ice cream, there are \\(7!=5040\\) ways for them to line up, since each way corresponds to a permutation of elements from \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\).\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n**Theorem 3.3.9**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of ordered subsets of size \\(k\\) from a set with \\(n\\) elements is_\n\\[n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.\\] (3.1)\n_More generally, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: An ordered subset of size \\(k\\) is a sequence of length \\(k\\) chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) in which no two entries are equal. There are \\(n\\) possibilities for the first entry. Once that entry is chosen, there are only \\(n-1\\) remaining possibilities for the second one, then \\(n-2\\) for the third, and so on. For the final \\(k\\)th entry, there are \\(n-k+1\\) possibilities. The decreasing number of possibilities for each entry guarantees that there are no repeated entries. The formula in (3.1) follows from the multiplication principle.\n\n\n",

In doing this, we find that the number of ternary strings with an even number of 0s is \\((3^{n}+1)/2\\).\nWe can also use exponential generating functions when there are bounds on the number of times a symbol appears, such as in the following example.\n**Example 8.19**.: How many ternary strings of length \\(n\\) have at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\)?\nSolution.To ensure that a symbol appears at least once, we need the following exponential generating function\n\\[x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\\cdots=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^{n}}{n!}.\\]\nYou should notice that this is almost the series for \\(e^{x}\\), except it's missing the first term. Thus, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}x^{n}/n!=e^{x}-1\\). Using this, we now have\n\\[(e^{x}-1)(e^{x}-1)e^{x}=e^{3x}-2e^{2x}+e^{x}\\]\nas the exponential generating function for this problem. Finding the series expansion, we have\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{3^{n}x^{n}}{n!}-2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{2^{n}x^{n}} {n!}+\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^{n}}{n!}.\\]\nNow we can answer the question by reading off the coefficient on \\(x^{n}/n!\\), which is \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\).\nBefore proceeding to an additional example, let's take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\nwhich there are no restrictions, a factor of \\(e^{7x}\\) is introduced. To account for an even number of \\(0\\)s, he uses \\((e^{x}+e^{-x})/2\\). For at least one \\(1\\), a factor of \\(e^{x}-1\\) is required. Finally, \\(1+x+x^{2}/2!+x^{3}/3!\\) accounts for the restriction of at most three \\(2\\)s. The exponential generating function for the number of \\(n\\)-digit passcodes is thus\n\\[e^{7x}\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}(e^{x}-1)\\left(1+x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3! }\\right).\\]\nDave sees this mess written on the whiteboard and groans. He figures they'll be there all day multiplying and making algebra mistakes in trying to find the desired coefficient. Alice points out that they don't really need to find the coefficient on \\(x^{n}/n!\\) for all \\(n\\). Instead, she suggests they use SageMath to just find the coefficient on \\(x^{8}/8!\\).\n``` f(x)=(exp(7*x)*((exp(x)+exp(-1*x))/(2))*(exp(x)-1)*\\) (1+x+x^2/2+x^3/factorial(3))).series(x,9) f(x).List()[8] ```\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBy convention, we set \\(0!=1\\).

If any interested student could be elected to any position (Alice contends this is a big \"if\" since Bob is running), how many different slates of officers can be elected?\nSolution.To count possible officer slates, work from a set \\(X\\) containing the names of the 80 interested students (yes, even poor Bob). A permutation of length four chosen from \\(X\\) is then a slate of officers by considering the first name in the permutation as the President, the second as the Vice President, the third as the Secretary, and the fourth as the Treasurer. Thus, the number of officer slates is \\(P(80,4)=37957920\\).\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\n\n",

By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\nProof.: Note that \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players out of a team of \\(2n\\) soccer players. We will count that in another way by separating the \\(2n\\) soccer players into two groups, by putting a gold jersey on \\(n\\) of the soccer players and a green jersey on the other \\(n\\) soccer players. From the first group, we choose \\(k\\) soccer players with gold jerseys. In order to choose \\(n\\) soccer players altogether, we need to choose \\(n-k\\) soccer players with green jerseys. Symbolically,\n\\[\\underbrace{1,2,\\ldots,n}_{\\text{choose $k$}},\\ \\ \\underbrace{n+1,n+2,\\ldots,2n}_{\\text{ choose $n-k$}}.\\]\nSo there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{n-k}\\) ways to do that.\nThe choice of the number \\(k\\) was arbitrary and so we need to consider all the possible values of \\(k\\), which could be as small as \\(0\\) and as big as \\(n\\). So we need to add up the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players as \\(k\\) varies between \\(0\\) and \\(n\\). This gives us:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.3 Combinations\nTo motivate the topic of this section, we consider another variant on the officer election problem from Example 2.7. Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of 80 students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the \"first\" seat on the executive council and her winning the \"fourth\" seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the 80 students without any regard to order. We'll return to this question after introducing our next concept.\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute \\(C(n,k)\\) in general.\n**Proposition 2.9**.: _If \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are integers with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\), then_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=C(n,k)=\\frac{P(n,k)}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\]\nProof.: If \\(X\\) is an \\(n\\)-element set, then \\(P(n,k)\\) counts the number of \\(X\\)-permutations of length \\(k\\). Each of the \\(C(n,k)\\)\\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) can be turned into \\(k!\\) permutations, and this accounts for each permutation exactly once. Therefore, \\(k!C(n,k)=P(n,k)\\) and dividing by \\(k!\\) gives the formula for the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets.\nUsing Proposition 2.9, we can now determine that \\(C(80,4)=1581580\\) is the number of ways a four-member executive council could be elected from the 80 interested students.\nOur argument above illustrates a common combinatorial counting strategy. We counted one thing and determined that the objects we wanted to count were _over-counted_ the same number of times each, so we divided by that number (\\(k!\\) in this case).\nThe following result is tantamount to saying that choosing elements to belong to a set (the executive council election winners) is the same as choosing those elements which are to be denied membership (the election losers).\n**Proposition 2.10**.: _For all integers \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\),_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}.\\]\n**Example 2.11**.: A Southern restaurant lists 21 items in the \"vegetable\" category of its menu. (Like any good Southern restaurant, macaroni and cheese is _one_ of the vegetable options.) They sell a vegetable plate which gives the customer four different vegetables from the menu. Since there is no importance to the order the vegetables are placed on the plate, there are \\(C(21,4)=5985\\) different ways for a customer to order a vegetable plate at the restaurant.\n\n\n",

Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other.

Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 1.2 Enumeration\nMany basic problems in combinatorics involve counting the number of distributions of objects into cells--where we may or may not be able to distinguish between the objects and the same for the cells. Also, the cells may be arranged in patterns. Here are concrete examples.\nAmanda has three children: Dawn, Keesha and Seth.\n1. Amanda has ten one dollar bills and decides to give the full amount to her children. How many ways can she do this? For example, one way she might distribute the funds is to give Dawn and Keesha four dollars each with Seth receiving the balance--two dollars. Another way is to give the entire amount to Keesha, an option that probably won't make Dawn and Seth very happy. Note that hidden within this question is the assumption that Amanda does not distinguish the individual dollar bills, say by carefully examining their serial numbers. Instead, we intend that she need only decide the _amount_ each of the three children is to receive.\n2. The amounts of money distributed to the three children form a sequence which if written in non-increasing order has the form: \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\) with \\(a_{1}\\geq a_{2}\\geq a_{3}\\) and \\(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=10\\). How many such sequences are there?\n3. Suppose Amanda decides to give each child at least one dollar. How does this change the answers to the first two questions?\n4. Now suppose that Amanda has ten books, in fact the top 10 books from the New York Times best-seller list, and decides to give them to her children. How many ways can she do this? Again, we note that there is a hidden assumption--the ten books are all different.\n5. Suppose the ten books are labeled \\(B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{10}\\). The sets of books given to the three children are pairwise disjoint and their union is \\(\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{10}\\}\\). How many different sets of the form \\(\\{S_{1},S_{2},S_{3}\\}\\) where \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\) and \\(S_{3}\\) are pairwise disjoint and \\(S_{1}\\cup S_{2}\\cup S_{3}=\\{B_{1},B_{2},\\ldots,B_{10}\\}\\)?\n6. Suppose Amanda decides to give each child at least one book. How does this change the answers to the preceding two questions?\n7. How would we possibly answer these kinds of questions if ten was really ten thousand (OK, we're not talking about children any more!) and three was three thousand? Could you write the answer on a single page in a book?\n\n\n",

In doing this, we find that the number of ternary strings with an even number of 0s is \\((3^{n}+1)/2\\).\nWe can also use exponential generating functions when there are bounds on the number of times a symbol appears, such as in the following example.\n**Example 8.19**.: How many ternary strings of length \\(n\\) have at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\)?\nSolution.To ensure that a symbol appears at least once, we need the following exponential generating function\n\\[x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\\cdots=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^{n}}{n!}.\\]\nYou should notice that this is almost the series for \\(e^{x}\\), except it's missing the first term. Thus, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}x^{n}/n!=e^{x}-1\\). Using this, we now have\n\\[(e^{x}-1)(e^{x}-1)e^{x}=e^{3x}-2e^{2x}+e^{x}\\]\nas the exponential generating function for this problem. Finding the series expansion, we have\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{3^{n}x^{n}}{n!}-2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{2^{n}x^{n}} {n!}+\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^{n}}{n!}.\\]\nNow we can answer the question by reading off the coefficient on \\(x^{n}/n!\\), which is \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\).\nBefore proceeding to an additional example, let's take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\nwhich there are no restrictions, a factor of \\(e^{7x}\\) is introduced. To account for an even number of \\(0\\)s, he uses \\((e^{x}+e^{-x})/2\\). For at least one \\(1\\), a factor of \\(e^{x}-1\\) is required. Finally, \\(1+x+x^{2}/2!+x^{3}/3!\\) accounts for the restriction of at most three \\(2\\)s. The exponential generating function for the number of \\(n\\)-digit passcodes is thus\n\\[e^{7x}\\frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}(e^{x}-1)\\left(1+x+\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3! }\\right).\\]\nDave sees this mess written on the whiteboard and groans. He figures they'll be there all day multiplying and making algebra mistakes in trying to find the desired coefficient. Alice points out that they don't really need to find the coefficient on \\(x^{n}/n!\\) for all \\(n\\). Instead, she suggests they use SageMath to just find the coefficient on \\(x^{8}/8!\\).\n``` f(x)=(exp(7*x)*((exp(x)+exp(-1*x))/(2))*(exp(x)-1)*\\) (1+x+x^2/2+x^3/factorial(3))).series(x,9) f(x).List()[8] ```\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBy convention, we set \\(0!=1\\). As an example, \\(7!=7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=5040\\). Now for integers \\(m,n\\) with \\(m\\geq n\\geq 0\\) define \\(P(m,n)\\) by\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)\\cdots(m-n+1).\\]\nFor example, \\(P(9,3)=9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7=504\\) and \\(P(8,4)=8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5=1680\\). Also, a computer algebra system will quickly report that\n\\[P(68,23)=20732231223375515741894286164203929600000.\\]\n**Proposition 2.6**.: _If \\(X\\) is an \\(m\\)-element set and \\(n\\) is a positive integer with \\(m\\geq n\\), then the number of \\(X\\)-strings of length \\(n\\) that are permutations is \\(P(m,n)\\)._\nProof.: The proposition is true since when constructing a permutation \\(s=x_{1}x_{2},\\dots x_{n}\\) from an \\(m\\)-element set, we see that there are \\(m\\) choices for \\(x_{1}\\). After fixing \\(x_{1}\\), we have that for \\(x_{2}\\), there are \\(m-1\\) choices, as we can use any element of \\(X-\\{x_{1}\\}\\). For \\(x_{3}\\), there are \\(m-2\\) choices, since we can use any element in \\(X-\\{x_{1},x_{2}\\}\\). For \\(x_{n}\\), there are \\(m-n+1\\) choices, because we can use any element of \\(X\\) except \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots x_{n-1}\\). Noting that\n\\[P(m,n)=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}=m(m-1)(m-2)\\dots(m-n+1),\\]\nour proof is complete.\nNote that the answer we arrived at in Example 2.5 is simply \\(P(26,6)\\) as we would expect in light of Proposition 2.6.\n**Example 2.7**.: It's time to elect a slate of four class officers (President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer) from the pool of 80 students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. If any interested student could be elected to any position (Alice contends this is a big \"if\" since Bob is running), how many different slates of officers can be elected?\nSolution.To count possible officer slates, work from a set \\(X\\) containing the names of the 80 interested students (yes, even poor Bob). A permutation of length four chosen from \\(X\\) is then a slate of officers by considering the first name in the permutation as the President, the second as the Vice President, the third as the Secretary, and the fourth as the Treasurer. Thus, the number of officer slates is \\(P(80,4)=37957920\\).\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\n\n",

Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2.

See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2.

Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\nWe will now give some examples of the division principle using blocks that are constructed using congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Example 2.9.12**.: How many numbers in the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,40\\}\\) are congruent to 1 modulo 5?\nWe list the numbers between 1 and 40 that are congruent to 1 modulo 5:\n\\[\\{1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36\\}.\\]\nSo the answer is 8. In this example, there is a set partition of \\(S\\) into 5 blocks of size 8, where two numbers are in the same block exactly when they are congruent modulo 5.\nThis example works more generally.\n**Lemma 2.9.13**.: _Suppose \\(N\\) is a multiple of \\(m\\).

To celebrate, the seven students decide to get a large sundae in a bowl, filled with many different scoops of ice cream. There are 10 flavors of ice cream and a large sundae has 15 scoops. Since it is a hot day in Colorado, all of the scoops will melt together, so the order of the scoops does not matter. Each flavor can be used for as many of the 15 scoops as they want. How many different sundaes can student \\(c\\) order?\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.4. To solve problems of this type, we define a _multiset_; intuitively, this is a set whose elements do not need to be different.\n**Example 3.5.1**.: The multiset \\(\\{\\text{apple},\\text{apple},\\text{orange},\\text{pear},\\text{pear}\\}\\) denotes a collection of two identical apples, one orange, and two identical pears.\n**Definition 3.5.2**.: A **multiset** is a set, together with a positive integer multiplicity assigned to each element. Equivalently, it is a set \\(S\\), together with a function \\(f:S\\to\\mathbb{N}-\\{0\\}\\).\nA multiset can be written down in several ways:\n* by listing an element of the set \\(m\\) times if it has multiplicity \\(m\\);\n* by writing the multiplicity as a superscript on the element; (This method can sometimes lead to confusion.)\n* by writing down the function \\(f\\).\n**Example 3.5.3**.: Here are several ways to write the multiset with three 4's, one 5, and two 6's:\n* \\(\\{4,4,4,5,6,6\\}\\) or \\(\\{4,5,4,6,4,6\\}\\) (the order does not matter).\n* \\(\\{4^{\\times 3},5^{\\times 1},6^{\\times 2}\\}\\) Warning! The \\(4^{\\times 3}\\) written here does not mean 4 raised to the power \\(\\times 3\\). It means that 4 occurs 3 times in the multiset.\n* The function \\(f:\\{4,5,6\\}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(f(4)=3\\), \\(f(5)=1\\), and \\(f(6)=2\\).\n**Notation 3.5.4**.: The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements are chosen from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is sometimes written \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). We pronounce this symbol \"\\(n\\) multichoose \\(k\\)\" or \"\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\) with repeats\".\n#### Counting multisets with sticks and stones\nTo count the number of multisets of a certain kind, we use what we call the \"sticks and stones\" method. (In other sources, this is sometimes called the \"stars and bars\" method.) We illustrate this method first with an example.\n**Example 3.5.5**.: Suppose we have an unlimited supply of 5 kinds of fruit: apples, bananas, mangoes, oranges, and pears. Let's write them as A, B, M, O, and P for short. How many ways can we make a bag of 6 fruits?\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\n\n",

If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.

If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n**Definition 10.4.9**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(k\\) colors \\(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{k}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 11.1 A First Taste of Ramsey Theory\nBob likes to think of himself as a wild and crazy guy, totally unpredictable. Most guys do. But Alice says that Bob can't change his basic nature, which is excruciatingly boring. Carlos remarks that perhaps we shouldn't be so hard on Bob, because under certain circumstances, we can all be forced to be dull and repetitive.\nRecall that when \\(n\\) is a positive integer, we let \\([n]=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\). In this chapter, when \\(X\\) is a set and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer with \\(k\\leq|X|\\), we borrow from our line notation for binomial coefficients and let \\(C(X,k)\\) denote the family of all \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\). So \\(|C([n],k)|=C(n,k)\\) whenever \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\).\nRecall that the Pigeon Hole Principle asserts that if \\(n+1\\) pigeons are placed in \\(n\\) holes, then there must be some hole into which two or more pigeons have been placed. More formally, if \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are positive integers, \\(t>n(k-1)\\) and \\(f:[t]\\longrightarrow[n]\\) is any function, then there is a \\(k\\)-element subset \\(H\\subseteq[t]\\) and an element \\(j\\in[n]\\) so that \\(f(i)=j\\) for every \\(i\\in H\\).\nWe now embark on a study of an elegant extension of this basic result, one that continues to fascinate and challenge.\nReturning to the discussion at the start of this section, you might say that an induced subgraph \\(H\\) of a graph \\(G\\) is \"boring\" if it is either a complete subgraph or an independent set. In either case, exactly every pair of vertices in \\(H\\) behaves in exactly the same boring way. So is boredom inevitable? The answer is yes--at least in a relative sense. As a starter, let's show that any graph on six (or more) vertices has a boring subgraph of size three.\n**Lemma 11.1**.: _Let \\(G\\) be any graph with six of more vertices. Then either \\(G\\) contains a complete subgraph of size \\(3\\) or an independent set of size \\(3\\)._\nProof.: Let \\(x\\) be any vertex in \\(G\\). Then split the remaining vertices into two sets \\(S_{1}\\) and\n\\(S_{2}\\) with \\(S_{1}\\) being the neighbors of \\(x\\) and \\(S_{2}\\) the non-neighbors. Since \\(G\\) has at least six vertices, we know that either \\(|S_{1}|\\geq 3\\) or \\(|S_{2}|\\geq 3\\). Suppose first that \\(|S_{1}|\\geq 3\\) and let \\(y_{1}\\), \\(y_{2}\\) and \\(y_{3}\\) be distinct vertices from \\(S_{1}\\). If \\(y_{i}y_{j}\\) is an edge in \\(G\\) for some distinct pair \\(i,j\\in\\{1,23\\}\\), then \\(\\{x,y_{i},y_{j}\\}\\) is a complete subgraph of size \\(3\\) in \\(G\\). On the other hand, if there are no edges among the vertices in \\(\\{y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\\}\\), then we have an independent set of size \\(3\\).\nThe argument when \\(|S_{2}|\\geq 3\\) is dual.\nWe note that the bound of six in the preceding lemma is sharp, as a cycle on five vertices does not contain either a complete set of size \\(3\\) nor an independent set of size \\(3\\).\nNext, here is the statement that generalizes this result.\n**Theorem 11.2** (Ramsey's Theorem for Graphs).: _If \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers, then there exists a least positive integer \\(R(m,n)\\) so that if \\(G\\) is a graph and \\(G\\) has at least \\(R(m,n)\\) vertices, then either \\(G\\) contains a complete subgraph on \\(m\\) vertices, or \\(G\\) contains an independent set of size \\(n\\)._\n\n\n",

We start with a classical example.\n**Example 10.4.1**.: Six people walk into a room; some of the people know each other already and others do not. Prove that either some three of them all mutually know each other, or some three of them all mutually do not know each other.\nTo get a handle on the above problem, we can first model it as a graph theory problem; consider a graph on \\(6\\) vertices that represent the people, and where each pair of people is connected either by a solid or dashed edge according to whether they know each other or not, as shown:\nIn the above graph, notice that the vertices numbered \\(3,4,6\\) all mutually do not know each other. Their induced subgraph is a smaller complete graph \\(K_{3}\\), with all its edges the same \"color\" (where the two colors are solid and dashed in this case, but any two colors would work). To state our problem more precisely in terms of graphs, we make the following two definitions.\n**Definition 10.4.2**.: An \\(m\\)**-clique** in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to \\(K_{m}\\).\n**Definition 10.4.3**.: Suppose a graph \\(G\\) has every edge assigned a color. A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\).

This contest allows 4 people to win free ice cream for a year! The seven students in the set \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) eagerly enter, along with 100 other people. Out of the 107 entrants, how many ways are there to choose 4 winners? All winners receive the same prize.\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.1, where **order does not matter** and **repeats are not allowed**. We can solve problems of this type with the binomial coefficient formula from Section 1.2.3.\n**Theorem 3.4.1**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of subsets of size \\(k\\) in a set of size \\(n\\) is_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\\]\n_More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: We already proved this in Lemma 1.2.6. Here we repeat the proof from Method 1, using the vocabulary of sets. By Theorem 3.3.9, the number of _ordered_ subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). However, that counts each unordered subset \\(k!\\) times, since \\(k!\\) is the number of permutations of \\(k\\) objects (Theorem 3.3.4). Hence, by the division principle, the number of unordered subsets of size \\(k\\) is\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nUsing Theorem 3.4.1, we can complete the upper-left entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order does not matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.4.2**.: The number of ways to choose 2 fruits from 5 to bring to work on the same day is\n\\[\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!\\cdot 3!}=\\frac{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{2\\cdot 1 \\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=5\\cdot 2=10.\\]\n**Example 3.4.3**.: How many ways are there to select the top 25 NCAA DI football teams (of which there are 128) without ranking them?\nThis is the number of (unordered) subsets of size 25, giving \\(\\binom{128}{25}=\\frac{128!}{25!(128-25)!}=\\frac{128!}{25!103!}\\)\n**Example 3.4.4**.: The number of ways to pick 4 winners out of 107 entrants for the _Ice Cream for a Year_ contest is \\(\\binom{107}{4}=\\frac{107!}{4!\\cdot 103!}=5,160,610\\).\nChoosing the four winners in Example 3.4.4 is the same as eliminating the 103 people who did not win. So the number of ways to choose 103 people out of 107 gives the same answer. This leads us to the following corollary, which is often used to simplify problems.\n**Corollary 3.4.5**.: _These two binomial coefficients are equal: \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\)._\nSurprisingly, the formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) can also be useful in counting certain sequences or strings.\n**Example 3.4.6**.: How many binary strings (from the alphabet \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) have exactly \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-k\\) ones? To form such a binary string, we simply have to choose \\(k\\) positions for the 0's, out of \\(n\\) possible positions. This is the same as choosing an _unordered_ subset of \\(k\\) of the positions in the string (even though the string itself is ordered). Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

(See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBy the pigeonhole principle, one of the smaller triangles must contain the striking points of at least two arrows. The distance between these striking points is at most the length of the side of the smaller triangle. It follows that the striking points of those two arrows are within \\(1\\) meter of each other.\n**Example 5.6.6**.: There are \\(n\\) guests at a party, for some integer \\(n\\geq 2\\). Some pairs of them shake hands; (no one shakes hands with themself). Prove that at least two guests shook hands with the same number of people.\nEach guest shook between \\(0\\) and \\(n-1\\) hands. Let's label the boxes by the numbers \\(0\\) through \\(n-1\\) and put a person in box \\(i\\) if they shook hands with exactly \\(i\\) people. At first, it does not look like we can use the pigeonhole principle because there are \\(n\\) people and \\(n\\) boxes.\nHowever, there is one piece of information we did not use. Either box \\(0\\) or box \\(n-1\\) is empty. The reason is that if someone shook \\(0\\) hands, then no one shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests; if someone shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests, then no one shook \\(0\\) hands. Hence we are assigning \\(n\\) people to \\(n-1\\) boxes (labeled either by \\(0\\) through \\(n-2\\) or by \\(1\\) through \\(n-1\\)). By the pigeonhole principle, two people must be assigned to the same box, and hence shook the same number of hands.\n**Proposition 5.6.7**.: _(Pigeonhole principle Version 2) Suppose \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. If we place more than \\(kn\\) objects into \\(n\\) boxes, then some box contains at least \\(k+1\\) objects_\n**Remark 5.6.8**.: To obtain Version 1 from Version 2, substitute the value \\(k=1\\).\nProof.: If each box contained at most \\(k\\) objects, then the total number of objects would be at most \\(kn\\), which is a contradiction.\nTo solve the problem about Colorado at the beginning of the section, we use Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle as follows\n_Answer._ Label the boxes by the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(n=1,000,000\\). People are assigned to the \\(i\\)th box if they have exactly \\(i\\) hairs on their heads. Let \\(k=5\\). Since \\(5,612,000>5,000,000=(5)\\cdot(1,000,000)=k\\cdot n\\), there is a box with at least \\(6=k+1\\) people by the pigeonhole principle (Version 2). These \\(6\\) people all have the same number of hairs on their heads.\n**Remark 5.6.9**.: For pigeonhole principle problems, our recommendation is to:\n* Identify \\(k+1\\), and hence \\(k\\).\n* Define your \\(n\\) boxes (such that if enough objects land in a single box, then you have accomplished the goal of the problem!)\n* Make sure that the number of objects is bigger than \\(k\\cdot n\\).\nWe provide some harder examples.\n**Example 5.6.10**.: If 17 people are seated in a row of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 5 chairs are filled with people.\n_Brainstorm._\n_Answer._ There are 3 empty chairs. These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right. Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n\n\n",

(For instance, if \\(6\\) of the positions are not \\(2\\), we must first choose those \\(6\\) positions in \\(C(n,6)\\) ways and then there are \\(2^{6}\\) ways to fill in those six positions by choosing either a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\) for each position.)\n**Example 2.20**.: Explain why, for each non-negative integer \\(n\\),\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n}=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{ n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nSolution.Both sides count the number of bit strings of length \\(2n\\) with half the bits being \\(0^{\\prime}\\)s, with the right side first partitioning them according to the number of \\(1^{\\prime}\\)s occurring in the first \\(n\\) positions of the string. Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\nImagine the folders placed in a row. Then there are \\(17\\) gaps between them. Of these gaps, choose three and place a divider in each. Then this choice divides the folders into four non-empty sets. The first goes to Audrey, the second to Bart, etc. Thus the answer is \\(C(17,3)\\). In Figure 2.22, we illustrate this scheme with Audrey receiving \\(6\\) folders, Bart getting \\(1\\), Cecilia \\(4\\) and Darren \\(7\\).\n**Example 2.23**.: Suppose we redo the preceding problem but drop the restriction that each of the four employees gets at least one folder. Now how many ways can the distribution be made?\nFigure 2.22: Distributing Identical Objects into Distinct Cells\nSolution.The solution involves a \"trick\" of sorts. First, we convert the problem to one that we already know how to solve. This is accomplished by _artificially_ inflating everyone's allocation by one. In other words, if Bart will get 7 folders, we say that he will get 8. Also, artificially inflate the number of folders by 4, one for each of the four persons. So now imagine a row of \\(22=18+4\\) folders. Again, choose 3 gaps. This determines a non-zero allocation for each person. The actual allocation is one less--and may be zero. So the answer is \\(C(21,3)\\).\n**Example 2.24**.: Again we have the same problem as before, but now we want to count the number of distributions where only Audrey and Cecilia are guaranteed to get a folder. Bart and Darren are allowed to get zero folders. Now the trick is to artificially inflate Bart and Darren's allocation, but leave the numbers for Audrey and Cecilia as is. So the answer is \\(C(19,3)\\).\n**Example 2.25**.: Here is a reformulation of the preceding discussion expressed in terms of integer solutions of inequalities.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.2 Permutations\nBelow each position in the string, we've written the number of options for that position. (For example, there are 62 options for the second position, since there are 52 letters once both cases are accounted for and 10 digits. We then multiply these possibilities together, since each choice is independent of the others. Therefore, we have\n\\[26\\times 62^{5}\\times 2\\times 29^{5}\\times 10=9\\,771\\,287\\,250\\,890\\,863\\,360\\]\ntotal possible usernames.\n### 2.2 Permutations\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\nTo generalize the preceding example, we now introduce permutations. To do so, let \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(n\\) be a positive integer. An \\(X\\)-string \\(s=x_{1}x_{2}\\ldots x_{n}\\) is called\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c}  & & & & & & & & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\# & \\\\  & D & D & D & D & D & & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\% & \\\\  & L & L & L & L & L & . & * & * & * & * & * & * & \\\\ U & U & U & U & U & U & @ & L & L & L & L & D & \\\\ \\hline\n26 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 62 & 2 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 29 & 10 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2.4: String Template\na **permutation** if all \\(n\\) characters used in \\(s\\) are distinct. Clearly, the existence of an \\(X\\)-permutation of length \\(n\\) requires that \\(|X|\\geq n\\).\n\n\n",

If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n### Exercises\n1. _Counting Rocks!_ If 5 people pick up 11 rocks in total, show that someone picked up at least 3.\n2. _Counting Socks!_ If a drawer contains 16 black and 16 white socks, how many do you need to pick in order to have a matching pair?\n3.

And of course, when \\(n\\) is even, these are exactly the same family.\nOn the other hand, for Example 16.6, there are many extremal families, since for every complementary pair of sets, either member can be selected.\nWe close this brief tasting of extremal set theory with a real classic.\n**Theorem 16.8** (Erdos, Ko, Rado).: _Let \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) be positive integers with \\(n\\geq 2k\\). Then the maximum size of a family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of subsets of \\([n]\\) subject to the restrictions that (1) \\(A\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset\\) for all \\(A,B\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), and (2) \\(|A|=k\\) for all \\(A\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), is \\(\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\)._\nProof.: For the lower bound, consider the family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) of all \\(k\\) element subset of \\([n]\\) that contain 1.\nFor the upper bound, let \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) be a family of subsets of \\([n]\\) satisfying the two constraints. We show that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\). To accomplish this, we consider a circle in the Euclidean plane with \\(n\\) points \\(p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\) equally spaced points around its circumference. Then there are \\(n!\\) different ways (one for each permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\([n]\\)) to place the integers in \\([n]\\) at the points in \\(\\{p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}\\}\\) in one to one manner.\nFor each permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\([n]\\), let \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) denote the subfamily of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consisting of all sets \\(S\\) from \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) whose elements occur in a consecutive block around the circle. Then let \\(t=\\sum_{\\sigma}|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|\\).\nOur first claim is that \\(t\\leq kn!\\). To prove this, let \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation and suppose that \\(|\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)|=s\\geq 1\\). Then the union of the sets from \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\) is a set of points that form a consecutive block of points on the circle. Note that since \\(n\\geq 2k\\), this block does not encompass the entire circle. Accordingly there is a set \\(S\\) whose elements are the first \\(k\\) in a clockwise sense within this block. Since each other set in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) represents a clockwise shift of one of more positions, it follows immediately that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|\\leq k\\). Since there are \\(n!\\) permutations, the claim follows.\nWe now claim that for each set \\(S\\in\\mathcal{F}\\), there are exactly \\(nk!(n-k)!\\) permutations \\(\\sigma\\) for which \\(S\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\sigma)\\). Note that there are \\(n\\) positions around the circle and each can be used as the first point in a block of \\(k\\) consecutive positions in which the elements of \\(S\\) can be placed. Then there are \\(k!\\) ways to order the elements of \\(S\\) and \\((n-k)!\\) ways to order the remaining elements. This proves our claim.\nTo complete the proof of the theorem, we note that we have\n\\[|\\mathcal{F}|nk!(n-k)!\\leq t\\leq kn!,\\]\nand this implies that \\(|\\mathcal{F}|le\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\).\n\n\n",

In how many ways can he\nmake such a distribution? At first, this looks a lot like the problem of enumerating integers solutions of equations, except here the lottery tickets are not identical! A ticket bearing the numbers 1, 3, 10, 23, 47, and 50 will almost surely not pay out the same amount as one with the numbers 2, 7, 10, 30, 31, and 48, so who gets which ticket really makes a difference. Hopefully, you have already recognized that the fact that we're dealing with lottery tickets and grandchildren isn't so important here. Rather, the important fact is that we want to distribute distinguishable objects to distinct entities, which calls for counting functions from one set (lottery tickets) to another (grandchildren). In our example, we don't simply want the total number of functions, but instead we want the number of surjections, so that we can ensure that every grandchild gets a ticket.\nFor positive integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), let \\(S(n,m)\\) denote the number of surjections from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Note that \\(S(n,m)=0\\) when \\(n<m\\). In this section, we apply the Inclusion-Exclusion formula to determine a formula for \\(S(n,m)\\). We start by setting \\(X\\) to be the set of all functions from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Then for each \\(f\\in X\\) and each \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,m\\), we say that \\(f\\) satisfies property \\(P_{i}\\) if \\(i\\) is not in the range of \\(f\\).\n**Lemma 7.8**.: _For each subset \\(S\\subseteq[m]\\), \\(N(S)\\) depends only on \\(|S|\\). In fact, if \\(|S|=k\\), then_\n\\[N(S)=(m-k)^{n}.\\]\nProof.: Let \\(|S|=k\\). Then a function \\(f\\) satisfying property \\(P_{i}\\) for each \\(i\\in S\\) is a string of length \\(n\\) from an alphabet consisting of \\(m-k\\) letters. This shows that\n\\[N(S)=(m-k)^{n}.\\qed\\]\nNow the following result follows immediately from this lemma by applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, as there are \\(C(m,k)\\)\\(k\\)-element subsets of \\([m]\\).\n**Theorem 7.9**.: _The number \\(S(n,m)\\) of surjections from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\) is given by:_\n\\[S(n,m)=\\sum_{k=0}^{m}(-1)^{k}\\binom{m}{k}(m-k)^{n}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[S(5,3) =\\binom{3}{0}(3-0)^{5}-\\binom{3}{1}(3-1)^{5}+\\binom{3}{2}(3-2)^{5 }-\\binom{3}{3}(3-3)^{5}\\] \\[=243-96+3-0\\] \\[=150.\\]\nReturning to our lottery ticket distribution problem at the start of the section, we see that there are \\(S(15,4)=1016542800\\) ways for the grandfather to distribute his 15 lottery tickets so that each of the 4 grandchildren receives at least one ticket.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n**Example 3.5.13**.: When \\(k=5\\) and \\(n=4\\), for the multiset \\(\\{A_{1},A_{1},A_{3},A_{4},A_{4}\\}\\), person \\(A_{1}\\) receives 2 pennies, person \\(A_{2}\\) receives 0 pennies, person \\(A_{3}\\) receives 1 penny, and person \\(A_{4}\\) receives 2 pennies. As another example, if person \\(A_{2}\\) receives all the pennies, then the multiset is \\(\\{A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2},A_{2}\\}\\).\nThe number of ways to distribute \\(k=5\\) pennies to \\(n=4\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{4+5-1}{5}=\\binom{8}{5}=56\\) ways.\nA further variant of distribution problems is to count _compositions_, meaning lists of nonnegative integers with a fixed length and sum.\n**Example 3.5.14**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 nonnegative integers have sum equal to 9? Examples include \\((4,0,2,3)\\), \\((0,4,2,3)\\), and \\((0,0,0,9)\\). These are called _compositions_ of 9 of length 4.\nSuch a composition encodes a way to distribute \\(k=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people, where the first number on list indicates the number of pennies to person 1, the second is the number of pennies to person 2, and so on.\nTherefore there are \\(\\binom{4}{9}=\\binom{4+9-1}{9}=\\binom{12}{9}=220\\) compositions of 9 of length 4.\n**Corollary 3.5.15**.: _If \\(m\\geq n\\), the number of ways to distribute \\(m\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people, so that each person must receive at least one penny, is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\n**Example 3.5.16**.: The number of ways to distribute \\(m=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people so that each person gets at least one is \\(\\binom{9-1}{4-1}=\\binom{8}{3}=56\\).\n**Example 3.5.17**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 positive integers have sum equal to 9? Examples include \\((3,2,1,3)\\), \\((1,2,3,3)\\), \\((2,2,2,3)\\), but not \\((4,0,2,3)\\) as 0 is not positive.\nIn this case, by subtracting 1 from each of the elements of the list, it is the same as the number of compositions of 5 of length 4. This matches the problem in Example 3.5.13 and is therefore 56.\n### Exercises\n1. In each of the questions below, there are 7 types of sushi (each costing 1 dollar). 1.

This contest allows 4 people to win free ice cream for a year! The seven students in the set \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) eagerly enter, along with 100 other people. Out of the 107 entrants, how many ways are there to choose 4 winners? All winners receive the same prize.\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.1, where **order does not matter** and **repeats are not allowed**. We can solve problems of this type with the binomial coefficient formula from Section 1.2.3.\n**Theorem 3.4.1**.: _Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). The number of subsets of size \\(k\\) in a set of size \\(n\\) is_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\\]\n_More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are not allowed._\nProof.: We already proved this in Lemma 1.2.6. Here we repeat the proof from Method 1, using the vocabulary of sets. By Theorem 3.3.9, the number of _ordered_ subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). However, that counts each unordered subset \\(k!\\) times, since \\(k!\\) is the number of permutations of \\(k\\) objects (Theorem 3.3.4). Hence, by the division principle, the number of unordered subsets of size \\(k\\) is\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nUsing Theorem 3.4.1, we can complete the upper-left entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order does not matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.4.2**.: The number of ways to choose 2 fruits from 5 to bring to work on the same day is\n\\[\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!\\cdot 3!}=\\frac{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{2\\cdot 1 \\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}=5\\cdot 2=10.\\]\n**Example 3.4.3**.: How many ways are there to select the top 25 NCAA DI football teams (of which there are 128) without ranking them?\nThis is the number of (unordered) subsets of size 25, giving \\(\\binom{128}{25}=\\frac{128!}{25!(128-25)!}=\\frac{128!}{25!103!}\\)\n**Example 3.4.4**.: The number of ways to pick 4 winners out of 107 entrants for the _Ice Cream for a Year_ contest is \\(\\binom{107}{4}=\\frac{107!}{4!\\cdot 103!}=5,160,610\\).\nChoosing the four winners in Example 3.4.4 is the same as eliminating the 103 people who did not win. So the number of ways to choose 103 people out of 107 gives the same answer. This leads us to the following corollary, which is often used to simplify problems.\n**Corollary 3.4.5**.: _These two binomial coefficients are equal: \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\)._\nSurprisingly, the formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) can also be useful in counting certain sequences or strings.\n**Example 3.4.6**.: How many binary strings (from the alphabet \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) have exactly \\(k\\) zeroes and \\(n-k\\) ones? To form such a binary string, we simply have to choose \\(k\\) positions for the 0's, out of \\(n\\) possible positions. This is the same as choosing an _unordered_ subset of \\(k\\) of the positions in the string (even though the string itself is ordered). Therefore, there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such strings.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n#### Subsets\nInformally, a _subset_ is a set contained in a bigger set.\n**Definition 2.5.12**.: A set \\(A\\) is a **subset** of a set \\(B\\) (written \\(A\\subseteq B\\)) if every element of \\(A\\) is also an element of \\(B\\).\nFor instance, \\(\\{2,4\\}\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\), but \\(\\{2,4,5\\}\\not\\subseteq\\{2,3,4\\}\\).\n**Example 2.5.13**.: Let \\(A\\) be any set. Then \\(A\\subseteq A\\) because every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(A\\). Also \\(\\emptyset\\subseteq A\\) because there are no elements of \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\). Picking a subset of \\(S\\) is the same as\n* First, choosing if \\(a_{1}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices),\n* Next, choosing if \\(a_{2}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices), \\(\\vdots\\)\n* Finally, choosing if \\(a_{n}\\) is in the subset or not (2 choices).\nAt each step \\(i\\), there are 2 choices (include \\(a_{i}\\) or not). Since we make a decision \\(n\\) times, the total number of subsets is \\(\\underbrace{2\\cdot 2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot 2}_{n\\text{ times}}=2^{n}\\) by the multiplication principle.\n**Remark 2.5.17**.: Here is a way to visualize this proof when \\(n=3\\). Let's say \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\\}\\).\n\\(a_{2}\\) in subset?n\n**Remark 2.5.18**.: Theorem 2.5.16 even works when \\(n=0\\), since the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\) is the unique set with \\(0\\) elements, and there is \\(1=2^{0}\\) subset of \\(\\emptyset\\), namely \\(\\emptyset\\).\n**Remark 2.5.19**.: There is a more abstract way to think about Theorem 2.5.16. We can make another set \\(T\\), whose elements are the subsets of \\(S\\), which are sets themselves. Then \\(2^{n}\\) is the cardinality of \\(T\\).\n\n\n",

A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.3.4**.: How many lotto tickets are there, if a lotto ticket is a collection of 5 different numbers from \\(\\{1,\\ldots,90\\}\\), where order does not matter?\nWe already know one way to solve this problem! The number of lotto tickets is the number of ways to choose 5 numbers out of 90. This equals\n\\[\\binom{90}{5}=\\frac{90!}{5!\\cdot 85!}=\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 8 6}{5!}=43,949,268.\\]\nWe can do this problem a different way using the division principle to gain a better understanding why we divide by 5!. There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nIn a group of 10 people, each of whom has one of 3 different eye colors, at least how many people must have the same eye color?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**Definition 10.4.3**.: Suppose a graph \\(G\\) has every edge assigned a color. A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBy the pigeonhole principle, one of the smaller triangles must contain the striking points of at least two arrows. The distance between these striking points is at most the length of the side of the smaller triangle. It follows that the striking points of those two arrows are within \\(1\\) meter of each other.\n**Example 5.6.6**.: There are \\(n\\) guests at a party, for some integer \\(n\\geq 2\\). Some pairs of them shake hands; (no one shakes hands with themself). Prove that at least two guests shook hands with the same number of people.\nEach guest shook between \\(0\\) and \\(n-1\\) hands. Let's label the boxes by the numbers \\(0\\) through \\(n-1\\) and put a person in box \\(i\\) if they shook hands with exactly \\(i\\) people. At first, it does not look like we can use the pigeonhole principle because there are \\(n\\) people and \\(n\\) boxes.\nHowever, there is one piece of information we did not use. Either box \\(0\\) or box \\(n-1\\) is empty. The reason is that if someone shook \\(0\\) hands, then no one shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests; if someone shook hands with all \\(n-1\\) of the other guests, then no one shook \\(0\\) hands. Hence we are assigning \\(n\\) people to \\(n-1\\) boxes (labeled either by \\(0\\) through \\(n-2\\) or by \\(1\\) through \\(n-1\\)). By the pigeonhole principle, two people must be assigned to the same box, and hence shook the same number of hands.\n**Proposition 5.6.7**.: _(Pigeonhole principle Version 2) Suppose \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. If we place more than \\(kn\\) objects into \\(n\\) boxes, then some box contains at least \\(k+1\\) objects_\n**Remark 5.6.8**.: To obtain Version 1 from Version 2, substitute the value \\(k=1\\).\nProof.: If each box contained at most \\(k\\) objects, then the total number of objects would be at most \\(kn\\), which is a contradiction.\nTo solve the problem about Colorado at the beginning of the section, we use Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle as follows\n_Answer._ Label the boxes by the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(n=1,000,000\\). People are assigned to the \\(i\\)th box if they have exactly \\(i\\) hairs on their heads. Let \\(k=5\\). Since \\(5,612,000>5,000,000=(5)\\cdot(1,000,000)=k\\cdot n\\), there is a box with at least \\(6=k+1\\) people by the pigeonhole principle (Version 2). These \\(6\\) people all have the same number of hairs on their heads.\n**Remark 5.6.9**.: For pigeonhole principle problems, our recommendation is to:\n* Identify \\(k+1\\), and hence \\(k\\).\n* Define your \\(n\\) boxes (such that if enough objects land in a single box, then you have accomplished the goal of the problem!)\n* Make sure that the number of objects is bigger than \\(k\\cdot n\\).\nWe provide some harder examples.\n**Example 5.6.10**.: If 17 people are seated in a row of 20 chairs, then prove some consecutive set of 5 chairs are filled with people.\n_Brainstorm._\n_Answer._ There are 3 empty chairs. These separate the row into \\(n=4\\) \"boxes\" which we can call the far left, center left, center right, and far right. Each of these parts contains filled chairs, which are consecutively filled since there are no other empty chairs. (It is possible for one part to be empty or to contain only one chair.) Let \\(k=4\\), so that \\(k+1=5\\). Since \\(17>16=4\\cdot 4=k\\cdot n\\), Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle says that some box contains at least \\(k+1=5\\) objects, which means there are at least 5 consecutively filled chairs.\n\n\n",

We label the factors of \\((x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}\\) by \\(F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\). (Each factor equals \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m}\\) but we think of them as being different since one of them is first, second, etc). Let \\(S=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}\\) be the set of the \\(n\\) factors. To make the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) in the product, we need to choose the variable \\(x_{1}\\) from \\(k_{1}\\) of the factors, then choose the variable \\(x_{2}\\) from \\(k_{2}\\) of the factors, and so on.

In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 5.7 Additional problems for Chapter 5\n1.

Fermat's Little Theorem states that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), for any positive integer \\(a\\). For example, when \\(p=7\\): then \\(7\\) divides \\(1^{7}-1\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(2^{7}-2\\); \\(7\\) divides \\(3^{7}-3\\); etc. 1. For any \\(a\\geq 2\\), generalize Exercise 12b from Section 4.2 to show \\((x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{a})^{p}\\equiv x_{1}^{p}+\\cdots+x_{a}^{p}\\bmod p\\). 2. Substitute \\(x_{1}=1,\\ldots,x_{a}=1\\) to show that \\(a^{p}\\equiv a\\bmod p\\), which gives a proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n9. In this problem, we will prove Fermat's Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument. 1. Let \\(S\\) be the set of sequences of length \\(p\\) whose entries are in the alphabet \\(\\{1,\\ldots,a\\}\\) such that not all the entries of the sequence are the same. Explain why \\(|S|=a^{p}-a\\). 2. We say that two sequences in \\(S\\) are equivalent if the entries of one can be rotated to be the entries of the other. For example, when \\(p=5\\), then \\((1,2,3,4,5)\\) is equivalent to \\((2,3,4,5,1)\\). Explain why each equivalence class in \\(S\\) has size \\(p\\). Explain why it is important for \\(p\\) to be prime for this to be true. 3. Use the division principle to show that \\(p\\) divides \\(a^{p}-a\\).\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

There are 10 people in a dance class. How many ways can they pair off into 5 pairs of dance partners?

The coefficient of \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) is the multinomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}\\).

We label the factors of \\((x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m})^{n}\\) by \\(F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\). (Each factor equals \\(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{m}\\) but we think of them as being different since one of them is first, second, etc). Let \\(S=\\{F_{1},\\ldots,F_{n}\\}\\) be the set of the \\(n\\) factors. To make the monomial \\(x_{1}^{k_{1}}\\cdots x_{m}^{k_{m}}\\) in the product, we need to choose the variable \\(x_{1}\\) from \\(k_{1}\\) of the factors, then choose the variable \\(x_{2}\\) from \\(k_{2}\\) of the factors, and so on. This forms an ordered set partition of \\(S\\) with sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\), and so the result follows by Theorem 4.6.3.\n### Exercises\n1.

The sets \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\) are called the **blocks** of the ordered set partition.\n**Theorem 4.6.3**.: _The number of ordered set partitions of an \\(n\\)-element set \\(S\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) is the multinomial coefficient_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{m}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\\cdot k_{2}!\\cdots k_{m}!}.\\]\nProof.: We count the number of ordered set partitions of a set \\(S\\) of size \\(n\\) into blocks of sizes \\(k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{m}\\) as follows. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\). Out of the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements, there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{(n-k_{1})!}{k_{2}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2})}\\) ways to choose the next block \\(B_{2}\\). If \\(m\\geq 3\\), there are \\(\\binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}!}=\\frac{(n-k_{1}-k_{2})!}{k_{3}!(n-k_{1}-k_{2}-k_ {3})!}\\) ways to choose the third block \\(B_{3}\\), and so on. Multiplying these together, all the factorials cancel except for \\(n!\\) in the numerator and the terms \\(k_{1}!,\\ldots,k_{m}!\\) in the denominator. The result follows.\n**Example 4.6.4**.: In Example 4.6.1, the set \\(S\\) is the set of fruits in your refrigerator, \\(m=3\\), and \\(B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\) are the sets of fruit you will eat on each day (in order). Also \\(n=7\\), \\(k_{1}=2\\), \\(k_{2}=3\\), and \\(k_{3}=2\\). So the number of ordered set partitions is \\(\\binom{7}{2,3,2}=210\\).\n**Example 4.6.5**.: Suppose we have 11 different presents, and we would like to give 4 to person \\(a\\), then 1 to person \\(b\\), then 2 to person \\(c\\), then 4 to person \\(d\\). The number of ways we can do this is\n\\[\\binom{11}{4,1,2,4}=\\frac{11!}{4!1!2!4!}=34650.\\]\nIn the next remark, we compare anagrams with ordered set partitions. We will use this to prove Theorem 4.5.7.\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 7.8 Investigation: Partitions and their generating functions\nGenerating functions can be used to enumerate many different combinatorial objects. One very famous such object is called a _partition_. The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n#### Fun with infinite products\nIn the video above, it was shown informally that the generating function for the partition numbers \\(p(n)\\) has the infinite product formula:\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}p(n)x^{n}=\\frac{1}{(1-x)}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(1-x^{2})}\\cdot\\frac {1}{(1-x^{3})}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(1-x^{4})}\\cdots.\\]\nWe now explore infinite products of generating functions in more rigorous detail.\n**Definition 7.8.6**.: Let \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x),\\ldots\\) be an infinite collection of generating functions. We say that the infinite product\n\\[\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}F_{n}(x)=F_{1}(x)F_{2}(x)F_{3}(x)\\cdots\\]\n**converges to \\(G(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}b_{i}x^{i}\\)**, if the partial products\n\\[P_{m}(x)=\\prod_{n=0}^{m}F_{n}(x)=F_{1}(x)F_{2}(x)\\cdots F_{m}(x)\\]\nhave coefficients that eventually match those of \\(G(x)\\). This means that for all \\(i\\), there is some positive integer \\(N\\) such that if \\(m>N\\), the coefficient of \\(x^{i}\\) in \\(P_{m}(x)\\) equals \\(b_{i}\\).\nIf the product converges to \\(G(x)\\), we simply say that the infinite product is **equal** to \\(G(x)\\).\n**Question 7.8.7**.: Suppose \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x),\\ldots\\) are all equal to \\(1+x\\).\n1. Expand the first three partial products: \\[P_{1}(x)=F_{1}(x)=(1+x)=?\\] \\[P_{2}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)=(1+x)^{2}=?\\] \\[P_{3}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)=(1+x)^{3}=?\\]\n2. What is the coefficient of \\(x\\) in your answers to part 1? Find a pattern and determine the coefficient of \\(x\\) in \\(P_{m}(x)\\).\n3. Prove that the infinite product \\[F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdot F_{4}(x)\\cdots=(1+x)(1+x)(1+x)(1+x)\\cdots\\] does **not** converge to any generating function, because the pattern you found in part 2 does not converge.\n**Question 7.8.8**.: Define \\(F_{i}(x)=1+x^{2^{i-1}}\\) for all \\(i\\).\n1. Write out \\(F_{1}(x),F_{2}(x),F_{3}(x)\\), and \\(F_{4}(x)\\).\n2. Expand the first four partial products * \\(P_{1}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\), * \\(P_{2}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\), * \\(P_{3}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\), * \\(P_{4}(x)=F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdot F_{4}(x)\\).\n3. Find a pattern and use it to prove that the infinite product \\[F_{1}(x)\\cdot F_{2}(x)\\cdot F_{3}(x)\\cdots=(1+x)(1+x^{2})(1+x^{4})(1+x^{8})(1 +x^{16})\\cdots\\] does converge, and explain what generating function it converges to.\nFor the next two questions, you may find it helpful to watch the explanation in this section's video for why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-x^{i}}=\\sum p(n)x^{n}\\).\n**Question 7.8.9**.: Recall the definition of \\(q(n)\\) in Definition 7.8.3. Explain why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}(1+x^{i})=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}q(n)x^{n}\\).\n**Question 7.8.10**.: Explain why \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-x^{2i}}=\\sum E(n)x^{n}\\) where \\(E(n)\\) is the number of partitions of \\(n\\) that use only even parts.\n\n\n",

There are \\(90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86\\) ways to pick 5 different numbers from 1 to 90 one at a time. We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it. Since the order of the numbers on a lotto ticket does not matter, we have counted each ticket \\(5!\\) times. Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket. Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of 80 students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the \"first\" seat on the executive council and her winning the \"fourth\" seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the 80 students without any regard to order. We'll return to this question after introducing our next concept.\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute \\(C(n,k)\\) in general.\n**Proposition 2.9**.: _If \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are integers with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\), then_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=C(n,k)=\\frac{P(n,k)}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\]\nProof.: If \\(X\\) is an \\(n\\)-element set, then \\(P(n,k)\\) counts the number of \\(X\\)-permutations of length \\(k\\). Each of the \\(C(n,k)\\)\\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) can be turned into \\(k!\\) permutations, and this accounts for each permutation exactly once. Therefore, \\(k!C(n,k)=P(n,k)\\) and dividing by \\(k!\\) gives the formula for the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets.\nUsing Proposition 2.9, we can now determine that \\(C(80,4)=1581580\\) is the number of ways a four-member executive council could be elected from the 80 interested students.\nOur argument above illustrates a common combinatorial counting strategy. We counted one thing and determined that the objects we wanted to count were _over-counted_ the same number of times each, so we divided by that number (\\(k!\\) in this case).\nThe following result is tantamount to saying that choosing elements to belong to a set (the executive council election winners) is the same as choosing those elements which are to be denied membership (the election losers).\n**Proposition 2.10**.: _For all integers \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\),_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}.\\]\n**Example 2.11**.: A Southern restaurant lists 21 items in the \"vegetable\" category of its menu. (Like any good Southern restaurant, macaroni and cheese is _one_ of the vegetable options.) They sell a vegetable plate which gives the customer four different vegetables from the menu. Since there is no importance to the order the vegetables are placed on the plate, there are \\(C(21,4)=5985\\) different ways for a customer to order a vegetable plate at the restaurant.\n\n\n",

Here is some evidence for this: the cube and the octahedron\nhave the same number of edges, but the number of vertices and faces have been flipped. Similarly, the dodecahedron and icosahedron have the same number of edges, but the number of vertices and faces have been flipped.

Stretch it to lie flat in the plane. This gives a planar graph, where the outside face of the planar map corresponds to the face we removed from the polyhedron.\nThis planar graph has the same values for \\(v\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\).

Here is the way we can use this. Suppose we want to prove \\(F=G\\) where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are both mathematical formulas. Then we simply have to find a collection of objects such that both \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are the answer to the question \"how many are there in the collection\"?\n**Example 5.3.2**.: Suppose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers. Here is a combinatorial proof that\n\\[a\\cdot b=\\underbrace{b+b+\\cdots+b}_{a\\text{ summands}}\\]\nwhere the sum has \\(a\\) copies of \\(b\\). By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\nProof.: Note that \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players out of a team of \\(2n\\) soccer players. We will count that in another way by separating the \\(2n\\) soccer players into two groups, by putting a gold jersey on \\(n\\) of the soccer players and a green jersey on the other \\(n\\) soccer players. From the first group, we choose \\(k\\) soccer players with gold jerseys. In order to choose \\(n\\) soccer players altogether, we need to choose \\(n-k\\) soccer players with green jerseys. Symbolically,\n\\[\\underbrace{1,2,\\ldots,n}_{\\text{choose $k$}},\\ \\ \\underbrace{n+1,n+2,\\ldots,2n}_{\\text{ choose $n-k$}}.\\]\nSo there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{n-k}\\) ways to do that.\nThe choice of the number \\(k\\) was arbitrary and so we need to consider all the possible values of \\(k\\), which could be as small as \\(0\\) and as big as \\(n\\). So we need to add up the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players as \\(k\\) varies between \\(0\\) and \\(n\\). This gives us:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 10.4.3**.: Suppose a graph \\(G\\) has every edge assigned a color. A **monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique** in \\(G\\) is an \\(m\\)-clique all of whose edges are the same color.\nFor example, the graph above has a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique with vertices \\(3,4,6\\), where the edges between them are all dashed.\n**Question 10.4.4**.: How many monochromatic \\(3\\)-cliques can you find in the graph above?\nWe can now rephrase Example 10.4.1 in terms of graph theory:\n**Example 10.4.5**.: Prove that if each edge of \\(K_{6}\\) is colored with one of two colors, then there exists a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique.\nProof of Example 10.4.5.: To prove this, pick one of the vertices \\(x\\), and consider all \\(5\\) edges attached to \\(x\\). Since each of these \\(5\\) edges is either solid or dashed, by the pigeonhole principle, at least three edges share the same color. By symmetry, we can assume that this color is solid, so \\(x\\) is connected to at least three vertices, say \\(y,z,w\\), by solid edges.\nNow, consider the edges in the triangle formed by \\(y,z,w\\). If any of these edges is solid, they form a solid triangle with \\(x\\), and we have a monochromatic (solid) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the left first example below. But if none of the three edges is solid, then the triangle \\(y,z,w\\) is a monochromatic (dashed) \\(3\\)-clique, as in the right example below.\nSo in all cases we do indeed have a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique. This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\n\n\n",

We can partition these arrangements into blocks of size \\(2\\) that have the letters in the same position except for the two O's switched with each other.\n\\[\\{\\{\\text{CLO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2},\\text{CLO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{LO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ CO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LCO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{, LCO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2},\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{LO}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ LO}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CLO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CLO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{L},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{CO}_{1}\\text{L}\\},\\] \\[\\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LCO}_{2},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{LCO}_{1}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LO}_{2}\\text{C},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{L}\\text{ O}_{1}\\text{C}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{CL},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{CL}\\},\\ \\{\\text{O}_{1}\\text{O}_{2}\\text{LC},\\text{ O}_{2}\\text{O}_{1}\\text{LC}\\}\\}\\]\nThus there are \\(24/2=12\\) blocks, or \\(12\\) distinct rearrangements of the letters in COOL. See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\nProof.: If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(a=km+r\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that \\(a-r=km\\), which is divisible by \\(m\\). So \\(a\\equiv r\\bmod m\\) by definition. If \\(m\\) divides \\(a=a-0\\), then \\(a\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\) by definition.\n**Example 2.9.9**.: The hours of a day are described with congruence modulo 12. For example, if it is 11 o'clock and you need to wait 2 hours before eating lunch, then you will eat lunch at 1 o'clock. We write \\(11+2=13\\equiv 1\\bmod 12\\).\n**Example 2.9.10**.: Every even integer is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n**Example 2.9.11**.: The last digit of a number indicates its congruence modulo 10.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table?

If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\nFigure 15.1: The 16 colorings of the vertices of a square.\nby a different angle.)\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nUnlike the generating functions we encountered in Chapter 8, the generating functions we will develop in this chapter will have more than one variable. We begin by associating a monomial with each element of the permutation group involved. In this case, it is \\(D_{8}\\), the dihedral group of the square. To determine the monomial associated to a permutation, we need to write the permutation in cycle notation and then determine the monomial based on the number of cycles of each length. Specifically, if \\(\\pi\\) is a permutation of \\([n]\\) with \\(j_{k}\\) cycles of length \\(k\\) for \\(1\\leq k\\leq n\\), then the monomial associated to \\(\\pi\\) is \\(x_{1}^{j_{1}}x_{2}^{j_{2}}\\cdots x_{n}^{j_{n}}\\). Note that \\(j_{1}+2j_{2}+3j_{3}+\\cdots+nj_{n}=n\\). For example, the permutation \\(r_{1}=(1234)\\) is associated with the monomial \\(x_{4}^{1}\\) since it consists of a single cycle of length \\(4\\). The permutation \\(r_{2}=(13)(24)\\) has two cycles of length \\(2\\), and thus its monomial is \\(x_{2}^{2}\\). For \\(p=(14)(2)(3)\\), we have two \\(1\\)-cycles and one \\(2\\)-cycle, yielding the\nmonomial \\(x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{1}\\). In Table 15.10, we show all eight permutations in \\(D_{8}\\) along with their associated monomials.\nNow let's see how the number of 2-colorings of the square fixed by a permutation can be determined from its cycle structure and associated monomial. If \\(\\pi(i)=j\\), then we know that for \\(\\pi\\) to fix a coloring \\(C\\), vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) must be colored the same in \\(C\\). Thus, the second vertex in a cycle must have the same color as the first. But then the third vertex must have the same color as the second, which is the same color as the first. In fact, all vertices appearing in a cycle of \\(\\pi\\) must have the same color in \\(C\\) if \\(\\pi\\) fixes \\(C\\)! Since we are coloring with the two colors white and gold, we can choose to color the points of each cycle uniformly white or gold. For example, for the permutation \\(v=(12)(34)\\) to fix a coloring of the square, vertices \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) must be colored the same color (\\(2\\) choices) and vertices \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) must be colored the same color (\\(2\\) choices). Thus, there are \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings fixed by \\(v\\). Since there are two choices for how to uniformly color the elements of a cycle, letting \\(x_{i}=2\\) for all \\(i\\) in the monomial associated with \\(\\pi\\) gives the number of colorings fixed by \\(\\pi\\). In Table 15.10, the \"Fixed colorings\" column gives the number of 2-colorings of the square fixed by each permutation. Before, we obtained this manually by considering the action of \\(D_{8}\\) on the set of all 16 colorings. Now we only need the cycle notation and the monomials that result from it to derive this!\nRecall that Burnside's Lemma states that the number of colorings fixed by the action of a group can be obtained by adding up the number fixed by each permutation and dividing by the number of permutations in the group. If we do that instead for the monomials arising from the permutations in a permutation group \\(G\\) in which every cycle of every permutation has at most \\(n\\) entries, we obtain a polynomial known as the\n\n\n",

Then we simply have to find a collection of objects such that both \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are the answer to the question \"how many are there in the collection\"?\n**Example 5.3.2**.: Suppose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers.

By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\nProof.: Note that \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players out of a team of \\(2n\\) soccer players. We will count that in another way by separating the \\(2n\\) soccer players into two groups, by putting a gold jersey on \\(n\\) of the soccer players and a green jersey on the other \\(n\\) soccer players. From the first group, we choose \\(k\\) soccer players with gold jerseys. In order to choose \\(n\\) soccer players altogether, we need to choose \\(n-k\\) soccer players with green jerseys. Symbolically,\n\\[\\underbrace{1,2,\\ldots,n}_{\\text{choose $k$}},\\ \\ \\underbrace{n+1,n+2,\\ldots,2n}_{\\text{ choose $n-k$}}.\\]\nSo there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{n-k}\\) ways to do that.\nThe choice of the number \\(k\\) was arbitrary and so we need to consider all the possible values of \\(k\\), which could be as small as \\(0\\) and as big as \\(n\\). So we need to add up the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players as \\(k\\) varies between \\(0\\) and \\(n\\).

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom.

By repeated application of the Addition Principle, we see that the right-hand side, \\(b+b+\\cdots+b\\), counts the number of students in a school that has \\(a\\) classes with \\(b\\) students each. By the Multiplication Principle, \\(a\\cdot b\\) counts the number of ways to first walk into one of the \\(a\\) classrooms and then single out one of the \\(b\\) students in that class. Thus \\(a\\cdot b\\) is also equal to the total number of students, and so \\(a\\cdot b=b+b+\\cdots+b\\).\nWe can also prove more intricate identities combinatorially.\n**Example 5.3.3**.: Here is a combinatorial proof of Pascal's recurrence in Theorem 4.1.1 that\n\\[\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}.\\]\nProof.: Let's find the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) people from a classroom that has \\(n\\) students and \\(1\\) professor. Since there are \\(n+1\\) people in the room, the answer is \\(\\binom{n+1}{k}\\). On the other hand, we can separate the ways of choosing the group into (i) those that _do not_ contain the teacher and (ii) those that _do_ contain the teacher. There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) choices in case (i) and \\(\\binom{n}{k-1}\\) in case (ii) (since we are choosing only \\(k-1\\) of the students). By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy. The second proof proves an even harder identity, Vandermonde's identity, which reduces to Proposition 5.3.4 when we make a good choice for the variables.\nProof.: Note that \\(\\binom{2n}{n}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players out of a team of \\(2n\\) soccer players. We will count that in another way by separating the \\(2n\\) soccer players into two groups, by putting a gold jersey on \\(n\\) of the soccer players and a green jersey on the other \\(n\\) soccer players. From the first group, we choose \\(k\\) soccer players with gold jerseys. In order to choose \\(n\\) soccer players altogether, we need to choose \\(n-k\\) soccer players with green jerseys. Symbolically,\n\\[\\underbrace{1,2,\\ldots,n}_{\\text{choose $k$}},\\ \\ \\underbrace{n+1,n+2,\\ldots,2n}_{\\text{ choose $n-k$}}.\\]\nSo there are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{n-k}\\) ways to do that.\nThe choice of the number \\(k\\) was arbitrary and so we need to consider all the possible values of \\(k\\), which could be as small as \\(0\\) and as big as \\(n\\). So we need to add up the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) soccer players as \\(k\\) varies between \\(0\\) and \\(n\\). This gives us:\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n} =\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(\\text{\\# choices of $k$ players with gold jerseys})\\cdot(\\text{\\# choices of $n-k$ players with green jerseys})\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{n-k}\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot\\binom{n}{k}\\] \\[=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{k}^{2}\\] \\[=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+ \\binom{n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nHere is another identity.\n**Proposition 5.3.5**.: _(Vandermonde's identity.) Suppose \\(n,m,\\ell\\) are non-negative integers such that \\(0\\leq\\ell\\leq m+n\\)._\n\\[\\binom{n+m}{\\ell}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\ell}\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{m}{\\ell-k}.\\]\n_(In the summation above, we set \\(\\binom{n}{k}=0\\) if \\(k>n\\) and similarly set \\(\\binom{m}{\\ell-k}=0\\) if \\(\\ell-k>m\\).)_\nProof.: By analogy: in your kitchen cabinet, you have \\(n\\) granola bars (all different) and \\(m\\) bags of trail mix (all different). The left hand side counts the number of ways to choose \\(\\ell\\) snacks out of \\(n+m\\) choices.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**1.** Use the techniques of this chapter to find a maximum matching from V1 to V2 in the graph shown in Figure 14.11.

The five possible topics for their final projects are graph algorithms, posets, induction, graph theory, and generating functions. There are five students in the class, and they have each given their professor the list of topics on which they are willing to do their project. Alice is interested in posets or graphs. Bob would be willing to do his project on graph algorithms, posets, or induction. Carlos will only consider posets or graphs. Dave likes generating functions and induction. Yolanda wants to do her project on either graphs or posets. To prevent unauthorized collaboration, the professor does not want to have two students work on the same topic. Is it possible to assign each student a topic from the lists above so that no two students work on the same project? If so, find such an assignment. If not, find an assignment that maximizes the number of students who have assignments from their lists and explain why you cannot satisfy all the students' requests.\n**4**.

We put two lotto tickets in the same pile if the numbers on them are the same, just written in a different order. Then each pile has \\(5!=120\\) lotto tickets in it.

Hence the total number of lotto tickets is \\(\\frac{90\\cdot 89\\cdot 88\\cdot 87\\cdot 86}{5!}\\).\nAn alternative formulation of the division principle is as follows:\n**Division Principle 2:** If \\(a\\) things are grouped evenly into \\(c\\) collections of equal size, the number of things in each collection is \\(a/c\\).\nFor example, if we divide 90 pieces of fruit evenly into 9 baskets, then there are 10 pieces of fruit in each basket.

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n1.

The players mark the squares of the grid with the symbols X and O. This exercise uses Polya's enumeration theorem to investigate the number of different tic-tac-toe boards. (The analysis of _games_ is more complex, since it requires attention to the order the squares are marked and stopping when one player has won the game.)\n* Two tic-tac-toe boards are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by rotating the board or flipping it over. (Imagine that it is drawn on a clear piece of plastic.) Since the \\(9\\times 9\\) grid is a square, the group that acts on it in this manner is the dihedral group \\(D_{8}\\) that we have studied in this chapter. However, as with counting nonisomorphic graphs, we have to be careful to choose the way this group is represented in terms of cycles. Here we are interested in how permutations rearrange the nine squares of the tic-tac-toe board as numbered in Figure 15.16. For example, the effect of the transformation \\(r_{1}\\), which rotates the board \\(90^{\\circ}\\) clockwise, can be represented as a permutation of the nine squares as (13971)(2684)(5). Write each of the eight elements of \\(D_{8}\\) as permutations of the nine squares of a tic-tac-toe board.\n* Find the cycle index of \\(D_{8}\\) in terms of these permutations.\n* Make an appropriate substitution for \\(x_{i}\\) in the cycle index to find a generating function \\(t(X,O)\\) in which the coefficient on \\(X^{i}O^{j}\\) is the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards having \\(i\\) squares filled by symbol X and \\(j\\) squares filled by symbol O. (Notice that some squares might be blank!)\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards are there?\n* How many nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards have three X's and three O's?\n* When playing tic-tac-toe, the players alternate turns, each drawing their symbol in a single unoccupied square during a turn. Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 15.1 Coloring the Vertices of a Square\nLet's begin by coloring the vertices of a square using white and gold. If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\nFigure 15.1: The 16 colorings of the vertices of a square.\nby a different angle.)\nWhen it comes to flipping the square, there are four axes about which we can flip it: vertical, horizontal, positive-slope diagonal, and negative-slope diagonal. We denote these flips by \\(v\\), \\(h\\), \\(p\\), and \\(n\\), respectively. Now notice that \\(v(1)=2\\), \\(v(2)=1\\), \\(v(3)=4\\), and \\(v(4)=3\\). For the flip about the horizontal axis, we have \\(h(1)=4\\), \\(h(2)=3\\), \\(h(3)=2\\), and \\(h(4)=1\\). For \\(p\\), we have \\(p(1)=3\\), \\(p(2)=2\\), \\(p(3)=1\\), and \\(p(4)=4\\). Finally, for \\(n\\) we find \\(n(1)=1\\), \\(n(2)=4\\), \\(n(3)=3\\), and \\(n(4)=2\\). There is one more transformation that we must mention; the transformation that does nothing to the square is called the **identity transformation**, denoted \\(\\iota\\). It has \\(\\iota(1)=1\\), \\(\\iota(2)=2\\), \\(\\iota(3)=3\\), and \\(\\iota(4)=4\\).\nNow that we've identified the eight transformations of the square, let's make a table showing which colorings from Figure 15.1 are left unchanged by the application of each transformation. Not surprisingly, the identity transformation leaves all of the colorings unchanged. Because \\(r_{1}\\) moves the vertices cyclically, we see that only \\(C_{1}\\) and \\(C_{16}\\) remain unchanged when it is applied. Any coloring with more than one color would have a vertex of one color moved to one of the other color. Let's consider which colorings are fixed by \\(v\\), the flip about the vertical axis. For this to happen, the color at position \\(1\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(2\\), and the color at position \\(3\\) must be the same as the color at position \\(4\\). Thus, we would expect to find \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings unchanged by \\(v\\). Examining Figure 15.1, we see that these colorings are \\(C_{1}\\), \\(C_{6}\\), \\(C_{8}\\), and \\(C_{16}\\). Performing a similar analysis for the remaining five transformations leads to Table 15.2.\n\n\n",

In how many ways can we choose 4 balls, if at least 2 are red?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 2.7 Multinomial Coefficients\nLet \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n**Example 2.32**.: How many different rearrangements of the string:\nMItCHELIKELLERANDWILLIAMTTROTTERAREGENIUSES!!\nare possible if all letters and characters must be used?\nSolution.To answer this question, we note that there are a total of 45 characters distributed as follows: 3 A's, 1 C, 1 D, 7 E's, 1 G, 1 H, 4 I's, 1 K, 5 L's, 2 M's, 2 N's, 1 O, 4 R's, 2 S's, 6 T's, 1 U, 1 W, and 2 !'s. So the number of rearrangements is\n\\[\\frac{45!}{3!1!1!7!1!1!4!1!1!5!2!2!1!1!4!2!6!1!1!2!}.\\]\nJust as with binomial coefficients and the Binomial Theorem, the multinomial coefficients arise in the expansion of powers of a multinomial:\n**Theorem 2.33** (Multinomial Theorem).: _Let \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{r}\\) be nonzero real numbers with \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{r}x_{i}\\neq 0\\). Then for every \\(n\\in\\mathbf{N}_{0}\\),_\n\\[(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{r})^{n}=\\sum_{k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{r}=n}\\binom{n}{k_{ 1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{r}}x_{1}^{k_{1}}x_{2}^{k_{2}}\\cdots x_{r}^{k_{r}}.\\]\n**Example 2.34**.: What is the coefficient of \\(x^{99}y^{60}z^{14}\\) in \\((2x^{3}+y-z^{2})^{100}\\)? What about \\(x^{99}y^{61}z^{13}\\)?\nSolution.By the Multinomial Theorem, the expansion of \\((2x^{3}+y-z^{2})^{100}\\) has terms of the form\n\\[\\binom{100}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3}}(2x^{3})^{k_{1}}y^{k_{2}}(-z^{2})^{k_{3}}=\\binom{ 100}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3}}2^{k_{1}}x^{3k_{1}}y^{k_{2}}(-1)^{k_{3}}z^{2k_{3}}.\\]\nThe \\(x^{99}y^{60}z^{14}\\) arises when \\(k_{1}=33\\), \\(k_{2}=60\\), and \\(k_{3}=7\\), so it must have coefficient\n\\[-\\binom{100}{33,60,7}2^{33}.\\]\nFor \\(x^{99}y^{61}z^{13}\\), the exponent on \\(z\\) is odd, which cannot arise in the expansion of \\((2x^{3}+y-z^{2})^{100}\\), so the coefficient is \\(0\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\n\n\n",

The criteria that define a valid record identifier are recursive. A valid record identifier of length \\(n\\geq 2\\) can be constructed in the following ways:\n* beginning with any upper-case letter other than \\(D\\) and followed by any valid\nrecord identifier of length \\(n-1\\);\n* beginning with \\(1C,2K,\\) or \\(7J\\) and followed by any valid record identifier of length \\(n-2\\); or\n* beginning with \\(D\\) and followed by any string of \\(n-1\\) decimal digits.\nLet \\(r(n)\\) denote the number of valid record identifiers of length \\(n\\). We take \\(r(0)=1\\) and note that \\(r(1)=26\\). Find a recursion for \\(r(n)\\) when \\(n\\geq 2\\) and use it to compute \\(r(5)\\).\n**2.** Consider a \\(1\\times n\\) checkerboard. The squares of the checkerboard are to be painted white and gold, but no two consecutive squares may both be painted white. Let \\(p(n)\\) denote the number of ways to paint the checkerboard subject to this rule. Find a recursive formula for \\(p(n)\\) valid for \\(n\\geq 3\\).\n**3.** Give a recursion for the number \\(g(n)\\) of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) that do not contain \\(102\\) as a substring.\n**4.** A \\(2\\times n\\) checkerboard is to be tiled using two types of tiles. The first tile is a \\(1\\times 1\\) square tile. The second tile is called an \\(L\\)-tile and is formed by removing the upper-right \\(1\\times 1\\) square from a \\(2\\times 2\\) tile. The \\(L\\)-tiles can be used in any of the four ways they can be rotated. (That is, the \"missing square\" can be in any of four positions.) Let \\(t(n)\\) denote the number of tilings of the \\(2\\times n\\) checkerboard using \\(1\\times 1\\) tiles and \\(L\\)-tiles. Find a recursive formula for \\(t(n)\\) and use it to determine \\(t(7)\\).\n**5.** Let \\(S\\) be the set of strings on the alphabet \\(\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\) that do not contain \\(12\\) or \\(20\\) as a substring.
