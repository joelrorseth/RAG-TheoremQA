Something similar is true for line integrals of a certain form.\n**Theorem 16.3.1 Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals**  Suppose a curve \\(C\\) is given by the vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\), with \\({\\bf a}={\\bf r}(a)\\) and \\({\\bf b}={\\bf r}(b)\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=f({\\bf b})-f({\\bf a}),\\]\nprovided that \\({\\bf r}\\) is sufficiently nice.\nProof.: We write \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\\rangle\\), so that \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}=\\langle x^{\\prime}(t),y^{\\prime}(t),z^{\\prime}(t)\\rangle\\). Also, we know that \\(\\nabla f=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle\\). Then\n\\[\\int_{C}\\nabla f\\cdot d{\\bf r}=\\int_{a}^{b}\\langle f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}\\rangle \\cdot\\langle x^{\\prime}(t),y^{\\prime}(t),z^{\\prime}(t)\\rangle\\,dt=\\int_{a}^{b }f_{x}x^{\\prime}+f_{y}y^{\\prime}+f_{z}z^{\\prime}\\,dt.\\]\nBy the chain rule (see section 14.4) \\(f_{x}x^{\\prime}+f_{y}y^{\\prime}+f_{z}z^{\\prime}=df/dt\\), where \\(f\\) in this context means \\(f(x(t),y(t),z(t))\\), a function of \\(t\\). In other words, all we have is\n\\[\\int_{a}^{b}f^{\\prime}(t)\\,dt=f(b)-f(a).\\]\nIn this context, \\(f(a)=f(x(a),y(a),z(a))\\). Since \\({\\bf a}={\\bf r}(a)=\\langle x(a),y(a),z(a)\\rangle\\), we can write \\(f(a)=f({\\bf a})\\)--this is a bit of a cheat, since we are simultaneously using \\(f\\) to mean \\(f(t)\\) and \\(f(x,y,z)\\), and since \\(f(x(a),y(a),z(a))\\) is not technically the same as \\(f(\\langle x(a),y(a),z(a)\\rangle)\\), but the concepts are clear and the different uses are compatible. Doing the same for \\(b\\), we get\n\n\n",

The condition \\(F(c)=F(d)\\) means the outputs from the function (the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the ordered pairs) are the same. We see that the points \\((-1,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are both elements of \\(F\\) with \\(F(-1)=1\\) and \\(F(2)=1\\). Since \\(-1\\neq 2\\), we have established that \\(F\\) is _not_ one-to-one. 2. Graphically, we see the horizontal line \\(y=1\\) crosses the graph more than once. Hence, the graph of \\(F\\) fails the Horizontal Line Test.\nWe have shown that the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Example 5.2.1 are one-to-one. This means they are invertible, so it is natural to wonder what \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(g^{-1}(x)\\) would be. For \\(f(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{5}\\), we can think our way through the inverse since there is only one occurrence of \\(x\\). We can track step-by-step what is done to \\(x\\) and reverse those steps as we did at the beginning of the chapter. The function \\(g(x)=\\frac{2x}{1-x}\\) is a bit trickier since \\(x\\) occurs in two places. When one evaluates \\(g(x)\\) for a specific value of \\(x\\), which is first, the \\(2x\\) or the \\(1-x\\)? We can imagine functions more complicated than these so we need to develop a general methodology to attack this problem.

Use the procedure outlined on Page 384 and your graphing calculator to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\). Note that since \\(f(0)=0\\), it should be the case that \\(f^{-1}(0)=0\\).

What is the value of c?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 2.3.4** It seems clear that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\). Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\nand the variable of the limit was not \\(x\\) but \\(\\Delta x\\). The \\(x\\) was the variable of the original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, \\(x\\) was essentially a fixed quantity, telling us at what point we wanted the slope. (In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we focused on the time 2.) The quantity \\(a\\) of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always interested in what happened as \\(\\Delta x\\) became very close to zero.\nArmed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way. The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated; the good news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect, and this can be proved once and for all.\nLet's show carefully that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x+4=6\\). This is not something we \"need\" to prove, since it is \"obviously\" true. But if we couldn't prove it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.\n\n\n",

We note directly that the domain of \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4}{x}\\) is \\(x\\neq 0\\). By definition, a polynomial has all real numbers as its domain. Hence, \\(g\\) can't be a polynomial.\n2. Even though \\(p(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x}\\) simplifies to \\(p(x)=x^{2}+4\\), which certainly looks like the form given in Definition 3.1, the domain of \\(p\\), which, as you may recall, we determine _before_ we simplify, excludes \\(0\\). Alas, \\(p\\) is not a polynomial function for the same reason \\(g\\) isn't.\n3. After what happened with \\(p\\) in the previous part, you may be a little shy about simplifying \\(q(x)=\\frac{x^{3}+4x}{x^{2}+4}\\) to \\(q(x)=x\\), which certainly fits Definition 3.1. If we look at the domain of \\(q\\) before we simplified, we see that it is, indeed, all real numbers. A function which can be written in the form of Definition 3.1 whose domain is all real numbers is, in fact, a polynomial.\n4. We can rewrite \\(f(x)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) as \\(f(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is not a natural number, \\(f\\) is not a polynomial.\n5. The function \\(h(x)=|x|\\) isn't a polynomial, since it can't be written as a combination of powers of \\(x\\) even though it can be written as a piecewise function involving polynomials. As we shall see in this section, graphs of polynomials possess a quality2 that the graph of \\(h\\) does not. Footnote 2: Some authors say \\(f(x)=0\\) has degree \\(-\\infty\\) for reasons not even we will go into.\n\n\n",

The solutions to \\(\\cos(u)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) are \\(u=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Since the argument of cosecant here is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)\\), \\[\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi= \\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] To solve \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\), we first add \\(\\pi\\) to both sides \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k+\\pi\\] A common error is to treat the '\\(2\\pi k\\)' and '\\(\\pi\\)' terms as 'like' terms and try to combine them when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the '\\(\\pi\\)' and '\\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)' terms to get \\[\\frac{1}{3}x=\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\] We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get \\[x=3\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)=\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\] Solving the other equation, \\(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) produces \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n4. To solve \\(\\cos(3x)=2-\\cos(x)\\), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that \\(\\cos(3x)=4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\). \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(3x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 4\\cos^{3}(x)-3\\cos(x)&=&2-\\cos(x)\\\\ 2\\cos^{3}(x)-2\\cos(x)-2&=&0\\\\ 4u^{3}-2u-2&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\).\nTo solve \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\), we need the techniques in Chapter 3 to factor \\(4u^{3}-2u-2\\) into \\((u-1)\\left(4u^{2}+4u+2\\right)\\). We get either \\(u-1=0\\) or \\(4u^{2}+2u+2=0\\), and since the discriminant of the latter is negative, the only real solution to \\(4u^{3}-2u-2=0\\) is \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), so \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The only solution which lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) is \\(x=0\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(y=2-\\cos(x)\\) on the same set of axes over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) shows that the graphs intersect at what appears to be \\((0,1)\\), as required. \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=3\\cos(x)-2}\\) \\(y=\\cos(3x)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y=2-\\cos(x)}\\)\n\n\n",

Taking a cue from the previous problem, we begin solving \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)=1-\\log_{7}(3-x)\\) by first collecting the logarithms on the same side, \\(\\log_{7}(1-2x)+\\log_{7}(3-x)=1\\), and then using the Product Rule to get \\(\\log_{7}[(1-2x)(3-x)]=1\\). Rewriting this as an exponential equation gives \\(7^{1}=(1-2x)(3-x)\\) which gives the quadratic equation \\(2x^{2}-7x-4=0\\). Solving, we find \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x=4\\). Graphing, we find \\(y=f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) and \\(y=g(x)=1-\\frac{\\ln(3-x)}{\\ln(7)}\\) intersect only at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Checking \\(x=4\\) in the original equation produces \\(\\log_{7}(-7)=1-\\log_{7}(-1)\\), which is a clear domain violation.\n5. Starting with \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)=\\log_{2}(6-x)+3\\), we gather the logarithms to one side and get \\(\\log_{2}(x+3)-\\log_{2}(6-x)=3\\). We then use the Quotient Rule and convert to an exponential equation \\[\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\right)=3\\iff 2^{3}=\\frac{x+3}{6-x}\\] This reduces to the linear equation \\(8(6-x)=x+3\\), which gives us \\(x=5\\). When we graph \\(f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x+3)}{\\ln(2)}\\) and \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\ln(6-x)}{\\ln(2)}+3\\), we find they intersect at \\(x=5\\).\n6. Starting with \\(1+2\\log_{4}(x+1)=2\\log_{2}(x)\\), we gather the logs to one side to get the equation \\(1=2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\log_{4}(x+1)\\). Before we can combine the logarithms, however, we need a common base. Since 4 is a power of 2, we use change of base to convert \\[\\log_{4}(x+1)=\\frac{\\log_{2}(x+1)}{\\log_{2}(4)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Hence, our original equation becomes \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log_{2}(x+1)\\right)\\] \\[1 = 2\\log_{2}(x)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(x^{2}\\right)-\\log_{2}(x+1)\\] Power Rule \\[1 = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}\\right)\\] Quotient Rule Rewriting this in exponential form, we get \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{x+1}=2\\) or \\(x^{2}-2x-2=0\\).

Defining \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3\\), we get the domain of \\(r\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\), due to the presence of the logarithm. To find the zeros of \\(r\\), we set \\(r(x)=\\left(\\log_{2}(x)\\right)^{2}-2\\log_{2}(x)-3=0\\) which results in a 'quadratic in disguise.' We set \\(u=\\log_{2}(x)\\) so our equation becomes \\(u^{2}-2u-3=0\\) which gives us \\(u=-1\\) and \\(u=3\\).

Since we want \\(y(0)=40\\), we substitute and solve for \\(A\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{40&=25+Ae^{0}\\cr 15&=A,}\\]\nand so \\(y=25+15e^{-2t}\\) is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that \\(y\\) is never 25, so this makes sense for all values of \\(t\\). However, if we allow \\(A=0\\) we get the solution \\(y=25\\) to the differential equation, which would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require \\(y(0)=25\\). Thus, \\(y=25+Ae^{-2t}\\) describes all solutions to the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2(25-y)\\), and all solutions to the associated initial value problems. \\(\\sqcup\\)\\(\\sqcup\\)\nWhy could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of \\(y\\) were on one side of the equation and all instances of \\(t\\) were on the other; of course, in this case the only \\(t\\) was originally hidden, since we didn't write \\(dy/dt\\) in the original equation. This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution. If \\(y\\neq 25\\),\n\\[\\int{1\\over 25-y}\\,dy =\\int 2t\\,dt\\] \\[(-1)\\ln|25-y| =t^{2}+C_{0}\\] \\[\\ln|25-y| =-t^{2}-C_{0}=-t^{2}+C\\] \\[|25-y| =e^{-t^{2}+C}=e^{-t^{2}}e^{C}\\] \\[y-25 =\\pm\\,e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}\\] \\[y =25\\pm e^{C}e^{-t^{2}}=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}.\\]\nAs before, all solutions are represented by \\(y=25+Ae^{-t^{2}}\\), allowing \\(A\\) to be zero. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSuppose a mass \\(m\\) is hung on a spring with spring constant \\(k\\). If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Can we measure its integraion over the rectangle $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ using the Tonelli's Theorem? Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWe now turn our attention to reflections. We know from Section 1.1 that to reflect a point \\((x,y)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis, we replace \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\). If \\((x,y)\\) is on the graph of \\(f\\), then \\(y=f(x)\\), so replacing \\(y\\) with \\(-y\\) is the same as replacing \\(f(x)\\) with \\(-f(x)\\). Hence, the graph of \\(y=-f(x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(x\\)-axis. Similarly, the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\) is the graph of \\(f\\) reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis. Returning to the language of inputs and outputs, multiplying the output from a function by \\(-1\\) reflects its graph across the \\(x\\)-axis, while multiplying the input to a function by \\(-1\\) reflects the graph across the \\(y\\)-axis.4\n**Theorem 1.4**.: **Reflections.** Suppose \\(f\\) is a function.\n* To graph \\(y=-f(x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(x\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\n* To graph \\(y=f(-x)\\), reflect the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis by multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\).\nApplying Theorem 1.4 to the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) given at the beginning of the section, we can graph \\(y=-f(x)\\) by reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis\nBy reflecting the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis, we obtain the graph of \\(y=f(-x)\\).\nWith the addition of reflections, it is now more important than ever to consider the order of transformations, as the next example illustrates.\n**Example 1.7.2**.: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\). Use the graph of \\(f\\) from Example 1.7.1 to graph the following functions. Also, state their domains and ranges.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. The mere sight of \\(\\sqrt{-x}\\) usually causes alarm, if not panic. When we discussed domains in Section 1.4, we clearly banished negatives from the radicands of even roots. However, we must remember that \\(x\\) is a variable, and as such, the quantity \\(-x\\) isn't always negative. For example, if \\(x=-4\\), \\(-x=4\\), thus \\(\\sqrt{-x}=\\sqrt{-(-4)}=2\\) is perfectly well-defined. To find the domain analytically, we set \\(-x\\geq 0\\) which gives \\(x\\leq 0\\), so that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,0]\\). Since \\(g(x)=f(-x)\\), Theorem 1.4 tells us that the graph of \\(g\\) is the reflection of the graph of \\(f\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis. We accomplish this by multiplying each \\(x\\)-coordinate on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(-1\\), so that the points \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,1)\\), and \\((4,2)\\) move to \\((0,0)\\), \\((-1,1)\\), and \\((-4,2)\\), respectively. Graphically, we see that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,0]\\) and the range of \\(g\\) is the same as the range of \\(f\\), namely \\([0,\\infty)\\). 2. To determine the domain of \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{3-x}\\), we solve \\(3-x\\geq 0\\) and get \\(x\\leq 3\\), or \\((-\\infty,3]\\). To determine which transformations we need to apply to the graph of \\(f\\) to obtain the graph of \\(j\\), we rewrite \\(j(x)=\\sqrt{-x+3}=f(-x+3)\\). Comparing this formula with \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we see that not only are we multiplying the input \\(x\\) by \\(-1\\), which results in a reflection across the \\(y\\)-axis, but also we are adding \\(3\\), which indicates a horizontal shift to the left. Does it matter in which order we do the transformations? If so, which order is the correct order? Let's consider the point \\((4,2)\\) on the graph of \\(f\\). We refer to the discussion leading up to Theorem 1.3. We know \\(f(4)=2\\) and wish to find the point on \\(y=j(x)=f(-x+3)\\) which corresponds to \\((4,2)\\). We set \\(-x+3=4\\) and solve. Our first step is to subtract \\(3\\) from both sides to get \\(-x=1\\). Subtracting \\(3\\) from the \\(x\\)-coordinate \\(4\\) is shifting the point \\((4,2)\\) to the left. From \\(-x=1\\), we then multiply5 both sides by \\(-1\\) to get \\(x=-1\\). Multiplying the \\(x\\)-coordinate by \\(-1\\) corresponds to reflecting the point about the \\(y\\)-axis. Hence, we perform the horizontal shift first, then follow it with the reflection about the \\(y\\)-axis. Starting with \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we let \\(j_{1}(x)\\) be the intermediate function which shifts the graph of \\(f\\)\\(3\\) units to the left, \\(j_{1}(x)=f(x+3)\\). Footnote 5: Or divide - it amounts to the same thing.\nTo obtain the function \\(j\\), we reflect the graph of \\(j_{1}\\) about \\(y\\)-axis. Theorem 1.4 tells us we have \\(j(x)=j_{1}(-x)\\). Putting it all together, we have \\(j(x)=j_{1}(-x)=f(-x+3)=\\sqrt{-x+3}\\), which is what we want.6 From the graph, we confirm the domain of \\(j\\) is \\((-\\infty,3]\\) and we get that the range is \\([0,\\infty)\\). Footnote 6: If we had done the reflection first, then \\(j_{1}(x)=f(-x)\\). Following this by a shift left would give us \\(j(x)=j_{1}(x+3)=f(-(x+3))=f(-x-3)=\\sqrt{-x-3}\\) which isn’t what we want. However, if we did the reflection first and followed it by a shift to the right 3 units, we would have arrived at the function \\(j(x)\\). We leave it to the reader to verify the details.\n\n\n",

What is the limit of $g(x)/x$ as $x$ goes to infinity?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIt probably seems obvious that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2}x^{2}=4\\), and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obvious. If we write \\(x^{2}=x\\cdot x\\), and ask what happens when \\(x\\) approaches 2, we might say something like, \"Well, the first \\(x\\) approaches 2, and the second \\(x\\) approaches 2, so the product must approach \\(2\\cdot 2\\).\" In fact this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word \"must.\" Is it really true that if \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) approaches \\(b\\) then \\(xy\\) approaches \\(ab\\)? It is, but it is not really obvious, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might be quite complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then\nwe don't have to worry about it ever again. When we say that \\(x\\) might be \"complicated\" we really mean that in practice it might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:\n**Theorem 2.3.5** Suppose \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=M\\). Then\n\\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)g(x)=LM\\).\n_Proof._ We have to use the official definition of limit to make sense of this. So given any \\(\\epsilon\\) we need to find a \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) implies \\(|f(x)g(x)-LM|<\\epsilon\\). What do we have to work with? We know that we can make \\(f(x)\\) close to \\(L\\) and \\(g(x)\\) close to \\(M\\), and we have to somehow connect these facts to make \\(f(x)g(x)\\) close to \\(LM\\).\nWe use, as is so often the case, a little algebraic trick:\n\\[\\eqalign{|f(x)g(x)-LM|&=|f(x)g(x)-f(x)M+f(x)M-LM|\\cr&=|f(x)(g(x)-M)+(f(x)-L)M| \\cr&\\leq|f(x)(g(x)-M)|+|(f(x)-L)M|\\cr&=|f(x)||g(x)-M|+|f(x)-L||M|.\\cr}\\]\nThis is all straightforward except perhaps for the \"\\(\\leq\\)\". That is an example of the **triangle inequality**, which says that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any real numbers then \\(|a+b|\\leq|a|+|b|\\). If you look at a few examples, using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you should quickly understand why this is true; we will not prove it formally.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow this looks exactly like a derivative, namely \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\), that is, the function \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g(x)\\). If this all withstands scrutiny, we then get\n\\[{d\\over dx}f(g(x))=f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x).\\]\nUnfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what we mean by \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\) involves what happens when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 _but not equal to 0_. The qualification is very important, since we must be able to divide by \\(\\Delta x\\). But when \\(\\Delta x\\) is close to 0 but not equal to 0, \\(\\Delta g=g(x+\\Delta x))-g(x)\\) is close to 0 _and possibly equal to 0_. This means it doesn't really make sense to divide by \\(\\Delta g\\). Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to avoid this difficulty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details, which can be found in many calculus books. Note that many functions \\(g\\) do have the property that \\(g(x+\\Delta x)-g(x)\\neq 0\\) when \\(\\Delta x\\) is small, and for these functions the argument above is fine.\nThe chain rule has a particularly simple expression if we use the Leibniz notation for the derivative. The quantity \\(f^{\\prime}(g(x))\\) is the derivative of \\(f\\) with \\(x\\) replaced by \\(g\\); this can be written \\(df/dg\\). As usual, \\(g^{\\prime}(x)=dg/dx\\). Then the chain rule becomes\n\n\n",

First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\); roughly this says that there is no \"hole\" or \"jump\" at \\(x=a\\). We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\n\n",

A careful reading of the definition of continuous reveals the phrase \"_at every point in its domain._\" Because the location of the asymptote, \\(x=0\\), is not in the domain of the function, and because the rest of the function is continuous, we say that (d) is continuous. **Differentiability.** If a function has a derivative at every point, we say the function is **differentiable**. We can see that the tangent line is well-defined at every point on the graph in (c). Therefore, we say that (c) is a differentiable function.\n**Definition 2.5.4**: **Differentiable at a Point** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable at point \\(a\\) if \\(f^{\\prime}(a)\\) exists. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 2.5.5**: **Differentiable** A function \\(f\\) is differentiable if is differentiable at every point (excluding endpoints and isolated points in the domain of \\(f\\)) in the domain of \\(f\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n**THEOREM 14.2.6** Polynomials are continuous everywhere.

A vector function \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) gives the position of a point in terms of the parameter \\(t\\), which is often time, but need not be. Suppose \\(s\\) is the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use \\(s\\) for the variable, we get \\({\\bf r}(s)\\), the position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has traveled.\n\n\n",

Let's try to prove it. We will want to be able to show that \\(|x^{2}-4|<\\epsilon\\) whenever \\(0<|x-2|<\\delta\\), by choosing \\(\\delta\\) carefully. Is there any connection between \\(|x-2|\\) and \\(|x^{2}-4|\\)? Yes, and it's not hard to spot, but it is not so simple as the previous example. We can write \\(|x^{2}-4|=|(x+2)(x-2)|\\). Now when \\(|x-2|\\) is small, part of \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|\\) is small, namely \\((x-2)\\). What about \\((x+2)\\)? If \\(x\\) is close to 2, \\((x+2)\\) certainly can't be too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let's recall the \"game\" version of what is going on here. You get to pick an \\(\\epsilon\\) and I have to pick a \\(\\delta\\) that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny values of \\(\\epsilon\\) I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently \"bad\" move like \\(\\epsilon=1000\\). I expect that \\(\\epsilon\\) is going to be small, and that the corresponding \\(\\delta\\) will be small, certainly less than 1. If \\(\\delta\\leq 1\\) then \\(|x+2|<5\\) when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) (because if \\(x\\) is within 1 of 2, then \\(x\\) is between 1 and 3 and \\(x+2\\) is between 3 and 5). So then I'd be trying to show that \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\). So now how can I pick \\(\\delta\\) so that \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\) implies \\(5|x-2|<\\epsilon\\)? This is easy: use \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\), so \\(5|x-2|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\). But what if the \\(\\epsilon\\) you choose is not small? If you choose \\(\\epsilon=1000\\), should I pick \\(\\delta=200\\)? No, to keep things \"sane\" I will never pick a \\(\\delta\\) bigger than 1. Here's the final \"game strategy:\" When you pick a value for \\(\\epsilon\\) I will pick \\(\\delta=\\epsilon/5\\) or \\(\\delta=1\\), whichever is smaller. Now when \\(|x-2|<\\delta\\), I know both that \\(|x+2|<5\\) and that \\(|x-2|<\\epsilon/5\\). Thus \\(|(x+2)(x-2)|<5(\\epsilon/5)=\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n",

Analysis of \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=\\tan(x)+3\\) reveals two different trigonometric functions, so an identity is in order. Since \\(\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)\\), we get \\[\\sec^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\] \\[1+\\tan^{2}(x) = \\tan(x)+3\\quad\\text{(Since $\\sec^{2}(x)=1+\\tan^{2}(x)$.)}\\] \\[\\tan^{2}(x)-\\tan(x)-2 = 0\\] \\[u^{2}-u-2 = 0\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{Let $u=\\tan(x)$.}\\] \\[(u+1)(u-2) = 0\\]\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\n\n\n",

Then \\({\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle\\), \\(|{\\bf r}^{\\prime}(t)|=a\\), and \\({\\bf T}(t)=\\langle-a\\sin t,a\\cos t,0\\rangle/a\\). Now \\({\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)=\\langle-a\\cos t,-a\\sin t,0\\rangle/a\\) and \\(|{\\bf T}^{\\prime}(t)|=1\\). Finally, \\(\\kappa=1/a\\): the curvature of a circle is everywhere the reciprocal of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous example is \\(1/2\\); this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius \\(2\\), as shown in figure 13.3.1.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Find the length of \\(\\langle t^{2},\\sin t,\\cos t\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,1]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Find the length of the curve \\(y=x^{3/2}\\), \\(x\\in[1,9]\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Set up an integral to compute the length of \\(\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,e^{t}\\rangle\\), \\(t\\in[0,5]\\).

Just as \\({\\bf v}(t)\\) is a vector describing how \\({\\bf r}(t)\\) changes, so is \\({\\bf v}^{\\prime}(t)\\) a vector describing how \\({\\bf v}(t)\\) changes, namely, \\({\\bf a}(t)={\\bf v}^{\\prime}(t)={\\bf r}^{\\prime\\prime}(t)\\) is the **acceleration vector**.\n#### Example 13.4.1\nSuppose \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle\\cos t,\\sin t,1\\rangle\\). Then \\({\\bf v}(t)=\\langle-\\sin t,\\cos t,0\\rangle\\) and \\({\\bf a}(t)=\\langle-\\cos t,-\\sin t,0\\rangle\\). This describes the motion of an object traveling on a circle of radius 1, with constant \\(z\\) coordinate 1. The velocity vector is of course tangent to the curve; note that \\({\\bf a}\\cdot{\\bf v}=0\\), so \\({\\bf v}\\) and \\({\\bf a}\\) are perpendicular. In fact, it is not hard to see that \\({\\bf a}\\) points from the location of the object to the center of the circular path at \\((0,0,1)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

What is the numeric of the double integral of the function f(x,y)=x*y^3 exp^{x^2+y^2} over I?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. Since 16 is a power of 2, we can rewrite \\(2^{3x}=16^{1-x}\\) as \\(2^{3x}=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{1-x}\\). Using properties of exponents, we get \\(2^{3x}=2^{4(1-x)}\\). Using the one-to-one property of exponential functions, we get \\(3x=4(1-x)\\) which gives \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\). To check graphically, we set \\(f(x)=2^{3x}\\) and \\(g(x)=16^{1-x}\\) and see that they intersect at \\(x=\\frac{4}{7}\\approx 0.5714\\).\n2. We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\). Using the Power Rule, we get \\(-0.1t\\ln(3)=\\ln(2)\\), so we divide both sides by \\(-0.1\\ln(3)\\) to get \\(t=-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.1\\ln(3)}=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\). On the calculator, we graph \\(f(x)=2000\\) and \\(g(x)=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1x}\\) and find that they intersect at \\(x=-\\frac{10\\ln(2)}{\\ln(3)}\\approx-6.3093\\).\n3. We first note that we can rewrite the equation \\(9\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) as \\(3^{2}\\cdot 3^{x}=7^{2x}\\) to obtain \\(3^{x+2}=7^{2x}\\). Since it is not convenient to express both sides as a power of 3 (or 7 for that matter) we use the natural log: \\(\\ln\\left(3^{x+2}\\right)=\\ln\\left(7^{2x}\\right)\\). The power rule gives \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\). Even though this equation appears very complicated, keep in mind that \\(\\ln(3)\\) and \\(\\ln(7)\\) are just constants. The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other. We then divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(x\\), which we obtain by factoring. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ x\\ln(3)+2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&2x\\ln(7)-x\\ln(3)\\\\ 2\\ln(3)&=&x(2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3))\\quad\\mbox{Factor}.\\\\ x&=&\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\end{array}\\] Graphing \\(f(x)=9\\cdot 3^{x}\\) and \\(g(x)=7^{2x}\\) on the calculator, we see that these two graphs intersect at \\(x=\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{2\\ln(7)-\\ln(3)}\\approx 0.7866\\).\n\n\n",

Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.\n#### Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions\nFinally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. To determine the domain of \\(j\\), we solve \\(9x\\geq 0\\) to find \\(x\\geq 0\\). Our domain is once again \\([0,\\infty)\\). We recognize \\(j(x)=f(9x)\\) and by Theorem 1.6, we obtain the graph of \\(j\\) by dividing the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(f\\) by \\(9\\). From the graph, we see the range of \\(j\\) is also \\([0,\\infty)\\).\n3. Solving \\(\\frac{x+3}{2}\\geq 0\\) gives \\(x\\geq-3\\), so the domain of \\(m\\) is \\([-3,\\infty)\\). To take advantage of what we know of transformations, we rewrite \\(m(x)=-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}}+1\\), or \\(m(x)=-f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+1\\). Focusing on the inputs first, we note that the input to \\(f\\) in the formula for \\(m(x)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}\\). Multiplying the \\(x\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) corresponds to a horizontal stretching by a factor of \\(2\\), and adding the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) corresponds to a shift to the left by \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). As before, we resolve which to perform first by thinking about how we would find the point on \\(m\\) corresponding to a point on \\(f\\), in this case, \\((4,2)\\). To use \\(f(4)=2\\), we solve \\(\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}=4\\). Our first step is to subtract the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) (the horizontal shift) to obtain \\(\\frac{1}{2}x=\\frac{5}{2}\\). Next, we multiply by \\(2\\) (the horizontal stretching) and obtain \\(x=5\\). We define two intermediate functions to handle first the shift, then the stretching. In accordance with Theorem 1.3, \\(m_{1}(x)=f\\left(x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=\\sqrt{x+\\frac{3}{2}}\\) will shift the graph of \\(f\\) to the left \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) units.\n\n\n",

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\). If we can find \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) so that \\(\\partial Q/\\partial x-\\partial P/\\partial y=1\\), then the area is also\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy.\\]\nIt is quite easy to do this: \\(P=0,Q=x\\) works, as do \\(P=-y,Q=0\\) and \\(P=-y/2,Q=x/2\\).\n##### Example 16.4.3\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Essentially the same argument works for \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\); unfortunately, it is more difficult to show that most functions are equal to their Maclaurin series.\n**EXAMPLE 11.11.3** Find a polynomial approximation for \\(e^{x}\\) near \\(x=2\\) accurate to \\(\\pm 0.005\\).\nFrom Taylor's theorem:\n\\[e^{x}=\\sum_{n=0}^{N}{e^{2}\\over n!}\\,(x-2)^{n}+{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}(x-2)^{N+1},\\]\nsince \\(f^{(n)}(x)=e^{x}\\) for all \\(n\\). We are interested in \\(x\\) near \\(2\\), and we need to keep \\(|(x-2)^{N+1}|\\) in check, so we may as well specify that \\(|x-2|\\leq 1\\), so \\(x\\in[1,3]\\). Also\n\\[\\left|{e^{z}\\over(N+1)!}\\right|\\leq{e^{3}\\over(N+1)!},\\]\nso we need to find an \\(N\\) that makes \\(e^{3}/(N+1)!\\leq 0.005\\). This time \\(N=5\\) makes \\(e^{3}/(N+1)!<0.0015\\), so the approximating polynomial is\n\\[e^{x}=e^{2}+e^{2}(x-2)+{e^{2}\\over 2}(x-2)^{2}+{e^{2}\\over 6}(x-2)^{3}+{e^{2} \\over 24}(x-2)^{4}+{e^{2}\\over 120}(x-2)^{5}\\pm 0.0015.\\]\nThis presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also need to approximate \\(e^{2}\\), and any approximation we use will increase the error, but we will not pursue this complication. \\(\\sqcap\\)\nNote well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on a small interval, even though the series for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(e^{x}\\) converge for all \\(x\\); this is typical. To get the same accuracy on a larger interval would require more terms.\nExercises 11.11.\n1. Find a polynomial approximation for \\(\\cos x\\) on \\([0,\\pi]\\), accurate to \\(\\pm 10^{-3}\\)\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.4.2.** Let \\(f(x)=12x^{5}-20x^{4}+19x^{3}-6x^{2}-2x+1\\).\n1. Find all of the complex zeros of \\(f\\) and state their multiplicities.\n2. Factor \\(f(x)\\) using Theorem 3.14\n**Solution.**\n1. Since \\(f\\) is a fifth degree polynomial, we know that we need to perform at least three successful divisions to get the quotient down to a quadratic function. At that point, we can find the remaining zeros using the Quadratic Formula, if necessary. Using the techniques developed in Section 3.3, we get\n\\[\\begin{array}{r|rrrrrrr}\\frac{1}{2}&12&-20&19&-6&-2&1\\\\ &\\downarrow&6&-7&6&0&-1\\\\ \\hline 12&-14&12&0&-2&0\\\\ \\downarrow&6&-4&4&2\\\\ \\hline 12&-8&8&4&0\\\\ \\downarrow&-4&4&-4\\\\ \\hline 12&-12&12&0\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\nOur quotient is \\(12x^{2}-12x+12\\), whose zeros we find to be \\(\\frac{1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). From Theorem 3.14, we know \\(f\\) has exactly \\(5\\) zeros, counting multiplicities, and as such we have the zero \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) with multiplicity \\(2\\), and the zeros \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), each of multiplicity \\(1\\).\n2. Applying Theorem 3.14, we are guaranteed that \\(f\\) factors as \\[f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x-\\left[ \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\left(x-\\left[\\frac{1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right]\\right)\\]\nA true test of Theorem 3.14 (and a student's mettle!) would be to take the factored form of \\(f(x)\\) in the previous example and multiply it out9 to see that it really does reduce to the original formula \\(f(x)=12x^{5}-20x^{4}+19x^{3}-6x^{2}-2x+1\\). When factoring a polynomial using Theorem 3.14, we say that it is **factored completely over the complex numbers**, meaning that it is impossible to factor the polynomial any further using complex numbers. If we wanted to completely factor \\(f(x)\\) over the **real numbers** then we would have stopped short of finding the nonreal zeros of \\(f\\) and factored \\(f\\) using our work from the synthetic division to write \\(f(x)=\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(12x^{2}-12 x+12\\right)\\), or \\(f(x)=12\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)\\). Since the zeros of \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) are nonreal, we call \\(x^{2}-x+1\\) an **irreducible quadratic** meaning it is impossible to break it down any further using _real_ numbers.

Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) transform the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane into the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane. Finally, the small vectors we need to approximate an area will be \\(\\langle f_{u},g_{u},0\\rangle\\,du\\) and \\(\\langle f_{v},g_{v},0\\rangle\\,dv\\). The cross product of these is \\(\\langle 0,0,f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}\\rangle\\,du\\,dv\\) with length \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\,du\\,dv\\). The quantity \\(|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\) is usually denoted\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial(x,y)}{\\partial(u,v)}\\right|=|f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}|\\]\nand called the **Jacobian**. Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant\n\\[\\left|\\matrix{f_{u}&g_{u}\\cr f_{v}&g_{v}\\cr}\\right|,\\]\nwhich may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)\nBecause there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.\n**Example 15.7.1**.: Integrate \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\) over the region \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\\leq 2\\).\nThe equation \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\) describes an ellipse as in figure 15.7.5; the region of integration is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation \\(x=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\). Substituting into the function itself we get\n\\[x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2u^{2}+2v^{2}.\\]\nThe boundary of the ellipse is \\(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}=2\\), so the boundary of the corresponding region in the \\(u\\)-\\(v\\) plane is \\(2u^{2}+2v^{2}=2\\) or \\(u^{2}+v^{2}=1\\), the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration simpler.\nNext, we compute the Jacobian, using \\(f=\\sqrt{2}u-\\sqrt{2/3}v\\) and \\(g=\\sqrt{2}u+\\sqrt{2/3}v\\):\n\\[f_{u}g_{v}-g_{u}f_{v}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2/3}=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nHence the new integral is\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{R}(2u^{2}+2v^{2})\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,du\\,dv,\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe have cheated a bit in the previous two paragraphs. It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\n\n",

If we identify \\(g(x)=2^{x}\\), we see \\(f(x)=g(x-1)-3\\). We pick the points \\(\\left(-1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) on the graph of \\(g\\) along with the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) to track through the transformations. By Theorem 1.7 we first add \\(1\\) to the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the points on the graph of \\(g\\) (shifting \\(g\\) to the right \\(1\\) unit) to get \\(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,1)\\) and \\((2,2)\\). The horizontal asymptote remains \\(y=0\\). Next, we subtract \\(3\\) from the \\(y\\)-coordinates, shifting the graph down \\(3\\) units. We get the points \\(\\left(0,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\), \\((1,-2)\\) and \\((2,-1)\\) with the horizontal asymptote now at \\(y=-3\\). Connecting the dots in the order and manner as they were on the graph of \\(g\\), we get the graph below. We see that the domain of \\(f\\) is the same as \\(g\\), namely \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), but that the range of \\(f\\) is \\((-3,\\infty)\\).\n2. The graph of \\(f\\) passes the Horizontal Line Test so \\(f\\) is one-to-one, hence invertible. To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), we normally set \\(y=f(x)\\), interchange the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then proceed to solve for \\(y\\). Doing so in this situation leads us to the equation \\(x=2^{y-1}-3\\). We have yet to discuss how to solve this kind of equation, so we will attempt to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}\\) from a procedural perspective. If we break \\(f(x)=2^{x-1}-3\\) into a series of steps, we find \\(f\\) takes an input \\(x\\) and applies the steps 1. subtract 1 2. put as an exponent on 2 3. subtract 3 Clearly, to undo subtracting 1, we will add 1, and similarly we undo subtracting 3 by adding 3. How do we undo the second step? The answer is we use the logarithm. By definition, \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\) undoes exponentiation by 2. Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow as \\(x\\) approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one \\(-\\infty\\) and one \\(+\\infty\\), but only the size is important).

Answer true or false.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nbetween \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between \\(t_{0}\\) and \\(t_{1}\\) the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably convince you that this is so. But we can do better than \"experimentation\"--we can prove that this is so.\nWe start with the simplified version:\n**THEOREM 6.5.1 Rolle's Theorem** Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) has a derivative on the interval \\((a,b)\\), is continuous on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(f(a)=f(b)\\). Then at some value \\(c\\in(a,b)\\), \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n_Proof._ We know that \\(f(x)\\) has a maximum and minimum value on \\([a,b]\\) (because it is continuous), and we also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility is removed.\nIf the maximum or minimum occurs at a point \\(c\\), other than an endpoint, where \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\), then we have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that \\(f(x)=f(a)=f(b)\\) at every \\(x\\in[a,b]\\), so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere in \\((a,b)\\). Then we may choose any \\(c\\) at all to get \\(f^{\\prime}(c)=0\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and geometry. Referring to figure 4.3.2, \\(x\\) is the measure of the angle in radians.

The relation \\(R\\) consists of all points \\((x,y)\\) whose \\(y\\)-coordinate is greater than \\(|x|\\). If we graph \\(y=|x|\\), then we want all of the points in the plane _above_ the points on the graph. Dotting the graph of \\(y=|x|\\) as we have done before to indicate that the points on the graph itself are not in the relation, we get the shaded region below on the left.\n2. For a point to be in \\(S\\), its \\(y\\)-coordinate must be less than or equal to the \\(y\\)-coordinate on the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). This is the set of all points _below_ or _on_ the parabola \\(y=2-x^{2}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n3. Finally, the relation \\(T\\) takes the points whose \\(y\\)-coordinates satisfy both the conditions given in \\(R\\) and those of \\(S\\). Thus we shade the region between \\(y=|x|\\) and \\(y=2-x^{2}\\), keeping those points on the parabola, but not the points on \\(y=|x|\\). To get an accurate graph, we need to find where these two graphs intersect, so we set \\(|x|=2-x^{2}\\). Proceeding as before, breaking this equation into cases, we get \\(x=-1,1\\).

The curve \\(y^{2}-x-4=0\\) describes a parabola since exactly one of the variables is squared. Rewriting this in standard form, we get \\(y^{2}=x+4\\) and we see that the vertex is \\((-4,0)\\) and the parabola opens to the right. Using the test points \\((-5,0)\\) and \\((0,0)\\), we find that the solution to the inequality includes the region to the right of, or 'inside', the parabola. The points on the parabola itself are also part of the solution, since the vertex \\((-4,0)\\) satisfies the inequality. We now turn our attention to \\(x<y+2\\). Proceeding as before, we write \\(x-y-2<0\\) and focus our attention on \\(x-y-2=0\\), which is the line \\(y=x-2\\). Using the test points \\((0,0)\\) and \\((0,-4)\\), we find points in the region above the line \\(y=x-2\\) satisfy the inequality. The points on the line \\(y=x-2\\) do not satisfy the inequality, since the \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0,-2)\\) does not. We see that these two regions do overlap, and to make the graph more precise, we seek the intersection of these two curves. That is, we need to solve the system of nonlinear equations \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}(E1)&y^{2}&=&x+4\\\\ (E2)&y&=&x-2\\end{array}\\right.\\] Solving \\(E1\\) for \\(x\\), we get \\(x=y^{2}-4\\). Substituting this into \\(E2\\) gives \\(y=y^{2}-4-2\\), or \\(y^{2}-y-6=0\\). We find \\(y=-2\\) and \\(y=3\\) and since \\(x=y^{2}-4\\), we get that the graphs intersect at \\((0,-2)\\) and \\((5,3)\\). Putting all of this together, we get our final answer below. \\[\\xy\n\n\n",

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\).

This has vector equation \\({\\bf r}=\\langle v\\cos u,v\\sin u,2-v\\sin u\\rangle\\). We compute \\({\\bf r}_{u}=\\langle-v\\sin u,v\\cos u,-v\\cos u\\rangle\\), \\({\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle\\cos u,\\sin u,-\\sin u\\rangle\\), and \\({\\bf r}_{u}\\times{\\bf r}_{v}=\\langle 0,-v,-v\\rangle\\). To match the orientation of \\(C\\) we need to use the normal \\(\\langle 0,v,v\\rangle\\). The curl of \\({\\bf F}\\) is \\(\\langle 0,0,1+2y\\rangle=\\langle 0,0,1+2v\\sin u\\rangle\\), and the surface integral from Stokes's Theorem is\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{1}(1+2v\\sin u)v\\,dv\\,du=\\pi.\\]\nIn this case the surface integral was more work to set up, but the resulting integral is somewhat easier.\nProof of Stokes's Theorem.: We can prove here a special case of Stokes's Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses Green's Theorem.\nSuppose the surface \\(D\\) of interest can be expressed in the form \\(z=g(x,y)\\), and let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q,R\\rangle\\). Using the vector function \\({\\bf r}=\\langle x,y,g(x,y)\\rangle\\) for the surface we get the surface integral\n\\[\\eqalign{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\cdot d{\\bf S}&=\\int \\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}\\langle R_{y}-Q_{z},P_{z}-R_{x},Q_{x}-P_{y}\\rangle\\cdot \\langle-g_{x},-g_{y},1\\rangle\\,dA\\cr&=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{E}-R_{y}g_{x}+Q_ {z}g_{x}-P_{z}g_{y}+R_{x}g_{y}+Q_{x}-P_{y}\\,dA.}\\]\nHere \\(E\\) is the region in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane directly below the surface \\(D\\).\nFor the line integral, we need a vector function for \\(\\partial D\\). If \\(\\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle\\) is a vector function for \\(\\partial E\\) then we may use \\({\\bf r}(t)=\\langle x(t),y(t),g(x(t),y(t))\\rangle\\) to represent \\(\\partial D\\).

We find \\(N(0)=\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{0}}=\\frac{84}{2800}=\\frac{3}{100}\\). Since \\(N(t)\\) measures the number of people who have heard the rumor in hundreds, \\(N(0)\\) corresponds to 3 people.

I’d wager Jeff, Jamie, and Jason started it. So much for telling your best friends something in confidence!\n2. We could simply note that \\(N(t)\\) is written in the form of Equation 6.7, and identify \\(L=84\\). However, to see why the answer is 84, we proceed analytically. Since the domain of \\(N\\) is restricted to \\(t\\geq 0\\), the only end behavior of significance is \\(t\\to\\infty\\). As we've seen before,15 as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), we have \\(1997e^{-t}\\to 0^{+}\\) and so \\(N(t)\\approx\\frac{84}{1+\\text{very small }(+)}\\approx 84\\). Hence, as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), \\(N(t)\\to 84\\). This means that as time goes by, the number of people who will have heard the rumor approaches 8400. Footnote 15: See, for example, Example 6.1.2.\n3. To find how long it takes until 4200 people have heard the rumor, we set \\(N(t)=42\\). Solving \\(\\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-t}}=42\\) gives \\(t=\\ln(2799)\\approx 7.937\\).

We begin solving \\(2000=1000\\cdot 3^{-0.1t}\\) by dividing both sides by 1000 to isolate the exponential which yields \\(3^{-0.1t}=2\\). Since it is inconvenient to write 2 as a power of 3, we use the natural log to get \\(\\ln\\left(3^{-0.1t}\\right)=\\ln(2)\\).

The equation \\((x+2)\\ln(3)=2x\\ln(7)\\) is actually a linear equation and as such we gather all of the terms with \\(x\\) on one side, and the constants on the other.

For example, since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1/x)=0\\), it is clear that also \\(\\lim_{i\\to\\infty}(1/i)=0\\), that is, the numbers\n\\[{1\\over 1},{1\\over 2},{1\\over 3},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 5},{1\\over 6},\\ldots\\]\nget closer and closer to 0.

In general, whenever you want to know \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) you should first attempt to compute \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some reason \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)\\) does not exist, it may still be true that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n)\\) exists, but you'll have to figure out another way to compute it.\nIt is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence.

For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, \\(31/32,\\ldots\\) is not increasing, because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term \\(3/4\\) it is increasing, so the theorem tells us that the sequence \\(3/4,7/8,15/16,31/32,\\ldots\\) converges. Since convergence depends only on what happens as \\(n\\) gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can't turn a convergent sequence into a divergent one.\n**Example 11.1.14** Show that \\(\\{n^{1/n}\\}\\) converges.\nWe first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\). Consider the real function \\(f(x)=x^{1/x}\\) when \\(x\\geq 1\\). We can compute the derivative, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{1/x}(1-\\ln x)/x^{2}\\), and note that when \\(x\\geq 3\\) this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, \\(n^{1/n}>(n+1)^{1/(n+1)}\\) when \\(n\\geq 3\\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when \\(n\\geq 3\\), and so the sequence converges.

If \\(\\theta=\\pi\\), we repeat the argument with the difference being \\(\\vec{w}=k\\vec{v}\\) where \\(k<0\\).

In this case, \\(k=\\frac{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}>0\\).\nThe Law of Cosines yields \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}-2\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w} \\|\\cos(\\theta)\\). From Example 11.9.1, we know \\(\\|\\vec{v}-\\vec{w}\\|^{2}=\\|\\vec{v}\\|^{2}-2(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})+\\|\\vec{w}\\|^{2}\\).

What is \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nNow we can codify this by giving a precise definition to replace the fuzzy, \"gets closer and closer\" language we have used so far. Henceforward, we will say something like \"the limit of \\((-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2})/\\Delta x\\) as \\(\\Delta x\\) goes to zero is \\(-19.6\\),\" and abbreviate this mouthful\n### Limits\n#### 2.3.1 Limit\nSuppose \\(f\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nThe \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\delta\\) here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a very precise way, that \\(f(x)\\) can be made as close as desired to \\(L\\) (that's the \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\) part) by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\) (the \\(0<|x-a|<\\delta\\) part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must happen if \\(x=a\\), that is, if \\(|x-a|=0\\). This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting \\(a\\) for \\(x\\) doesn't even make sense.\nMake sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks about \\(f(x)\\), but the function and the variable might have other names. In the discussion above, the function we analyzed was\n\\[\\frac{-19.6\\Delta x-4.9\\Delta x^{2}}{\\Delta x}.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 4.10.2**: What happens to the function \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity? It seems clear that as \\(x\\) gets larger and larger, \\(1/x\\) gets closer and closer to zero, so \\(\\cos(1/x)\\) should be getting closer and closer to \\(\\cos(0)=1\\). \\(\\sqcap\\)__\nAs with ordinary limits, these concepts can be made precise. Roughly, we want \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) to mean that we can make \\(f(x)\\) arbitrarily large by making \\(x\\) close enough to \\(a\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) should mean we can make \\(f(x)\\) as close as we want to \\(L\\) by making \\(x\\) large enough. Compare this definition to the definition of limit in section 2.3, definition 2.3.2.\n**Definition 4.10.3** If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=\\infty\\) if for every \\(N>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) such that whenever \\(|x-a|<\\delta\\), \\(f(x)>N\\). We can extend this in the obvious ways to define \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=-\\infty\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\), and \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Definition 4.10.4** Limit at infinity If \\(f\\) is a function, we say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is an \\(N>0\\) so that whenever \\(x>N\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We may similarly define \\(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=L\\), and using the idea of the previous definition, we may define \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}f(x)=\\pm\\infty\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe include these definitions for completeness, but we will not explore them in detail. Suffice it to say that such limits behave in much the same way that ordinary limits do; in particular there are some analogs of theorem 2.3.6.\nNow consider this limit:\n\n\n",

(AP)\n### Exercises 8.6.\nIn the following problems, compute the trapezoid and Simpson approximations using 4 subintervals, and compute the error estimate for each. (Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIf \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then \\(L\\) is a good approximation of \\(f\\) so long as \\(x\\) is \"not too far\" from \\(a\\). Put another way, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\) then under a microscope \\(f\\) will look very much like a straight line. Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\). Then \\(f^{\\prime}(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{x+4})\\). The linear approximation to \\(f\\) at \\(x=5\\) is \\(L(x)=1/(2\\sqrt{5+4})(x-5)+\\sqrt{5+4}=(x-5)/6+3\\). As an immediate application we can approximate square roots of numbers near 9 by hand. To estimate \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), we substitute 6 into the linear approximation instead of into \\(f(x)\\), so \\(\\sqrt{6+4}\\approx(6-5)/6+3=19/6\\approx 3.1\\overline{6}\\). This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a \"reality check\" on a more complex calculation.

Here it is:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1^{2}}+{1\\over 2^{2}}+{1\\over 3^{2}}+\\cdots+{1\\over n^{2}}<1+ \\int_{1}^{n}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x^{2}}\\,dx=1+1=2,\\]\nrecalling that we computed this improper integral in section 9.7. Since the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}s_{n}=L\\leq 2\\), and so the series converges to some number at most 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that \\(L=\\pi^{2}/6\\approx 1.6\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nWe already know that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.

If \\(f(x)=\\ln(x^{3}+2)\\) compute \\(f^{\\prime}(e^{1/3})\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n### 4.8 Implicit Differentiation\nAs we have seen, there is a close relationship between the derivatives of \\(e^{x}\\) and \\(\\ln x\\) because these functions are inverses. Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.\nWe will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of \\(\\ln x\\). Let's write \\(y=\\ln x\\) and then \\(x=e^{\\ln x}=e^{y}\\), that is, \\(x=e^{y}\\). We say that this equation defines the function \\(y=\\ln x\\) implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression \\(y=\\ldots\\), it is true that if \\(x=e^{y}\\) then \\(y\\) is in fact the natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of \\(y\\) is that \\(x=e^{y}\\); what can we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIf \\(x\\) is positive, then this is the function \\(y=x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(1\\). (Recall that when \\(y=f(x)=mx+b\\), the derivative is the slope \\(m\\).) If \\(x\\) is negative, then we're dealing with the function \\(y=-x\\), whose derivative is the constant \\(-1\\). If \\(x=0\\), then the function has a corner, i.e., there is no tangent line. A tangent line would have to point in the direction of the curve--but there are _two_ directions of the curve that come together at the origin. We can summarize this as\n\\[y^{\\prime}=\\cases{1&if $x>0$;\\cr-1&if $x<0$;\\cr\\hbox{undefined}&if $x=0$.}\\]\n##### Example 2.4.5\nDiscuss the derivative of the function \\(y=x^{2/3}\\), shown in figure 2.4.1. We will later see how to compute this derivative; for now we use the fact that \\(y^{\\prime}=(2/3)x^{-1/3}\\). Visually this looks much like the absolute value function, but it technically has a cusp, not a corner. The absolute value function has no tangent line at \\(0\\) because there are (at least) two obvious contenders--the tangent line of the left side of the curve and the tangent line of the right side. The function \\(y=x^{2/3}\\) does not have a tangent line at \\(0\\), but unlike the absolute value function it can be said to have a single direction: as we approach \\(0\\) from either side the tangent line becomes closer and closer to a vertical line; the curve is vertical at \\(0\\). But as before, if you imagine traveling along the curve, an abrupt change in direction is required at \\(0\\): a full \\(180\\) degree turn.\nIn practice we won't worry much about the distinction between these examples; in both cases the function has a \"sharp point\" where there is no tangent line and no derivative.\n### 2.4 The Derivative\n\n\n",

Not surprisingly, non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more general equations.\nSuppose \\(\\phi(t,y)\\) is a function of two variables. A more general class of first order differential equations has the form \\(\\dot{y}=\\phi(t,y)\\). This is not necessarily a linear first order equation, since \\(\\phi\\) may depend on \\(y\\) in some complicated way; note however that \\(\\dot{y}\\) appears in a very simple form. Under suitable conditions on the function \\(\\phi\\), it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable property.\n##### Example 17.4.1\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=t-y^{2}\\) is a first order non-linear equation, because \\(y\\) appears to the second power. We will not be able to solve this equation. \\(\\Box\\)\n##### Example 17.4.2\nThe equation \\(\\dot{y}=y^{2}\\) is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of variables. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\).

In other cases we can try variation of parameters as we did in the first order case.\nSince as before \\(a\\neq 0\\), we can always divide by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(\\ddot{y}\\) equal to 1. Thus, to simplify the discussion, we assume \\(a=1\\). We know that the differential equation \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\) has a general solution \\(Ay_{1}+By_{2}\\). As before, we guess a particular solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\); this time we use the guess \\(y=u(t)y_{1}+v(t)y_{2}\\).

(The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: _To compute a certain sort of integral over a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations._\nNote that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.\n**Theorem 16.4.1**: **Green's Theorem**  If the vector field \\({\\bf F}=\\langle P,Q\\rangle\\) and the region \\(D\\) are sufficiently nice, and if \\(C\\) is the boundary of \\(D\\) (\\(C\\) is a closed curve), then\n\\[\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_{D}{\\partial Q\\over\\partial x}-{\\partial P\\over \\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy,\\]\nprovided the integration on the right is done counter-clockwise around \\(C\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nTo indicate that an integral \\(\\int_{C}\\) is being done over a closed curve in the counter-clockwise direction, we usually write \\(\\oint_{C}\\). We also use the notation \\(\\partial D\\) to mean the boundary of \\(D\\)**oriented** in the counterclockwise direction. With this notation, \\(\\oint_{C}=\\int_{\\partial D}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.\nHere is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely,\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}1\\,dA\\]\ncomputes the area of region \\(D\\). If we can find \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) so that \\(\\partial Q/\\partial x-\\partial P/\\partial y=1\\), then the area is also\n\\[\\int_{\\partial D}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy.\\]\nIt is quite easy to do this: \\(P=0,Q=x\\) works, as do \\(P=-y,Q=0\\) and \\(P=-y/2,Q=x/2\\).\n##### Example 16.4.3\nAn ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, is given by\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.\\]\nWe find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green's theorem. To do this we need a vector equation for the boundary; one such equation is \\(\\langle a\\cos t,b\\sin t\\rangle\\), as \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). We can easily verify this by substitution:\n\\[\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=\\frac{a^{2}\\cos^{2}t}{a^{2}}+\\frac{b^ {2}\\sin^{2}t}{b^{2}}=\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t=1.\\]\nLet's consider the three possibilities for \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) above: Using \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}0\\,dx+x\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}a\\cos(t)b\\cos(t)\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab\\cos ^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nUsing \\(-y\\) and \\(0\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-y\\,dx+0\\,dy=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-b\\sin(t)(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}ab \\sin^{2}(t)\\,dt.\\]\nFinally, using \\(-y/2\\) and \\(x/2\\) gives\n\\[\\oint_{C}-\\frac{y}{2}\\,dx+\\frac{x}{2}\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}-\\frac{b\\sin(t)}{2}(-a\\sin(t))\\,dt+\\frac{a\\cos(t)} {2}(b\\cos(t))\\,dt\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab\\sin^{2}t}{2}+\\frac{ab\\cos^{2}t}{2}\\,dt= \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\frac{ab}{2}\\,dt=\\pi ab.\\]\nThe first two integrals are not particularly difficult, but the third is very easy, though the choice of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) seems more complicated. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\n",

Consider what happens as we move from one term to the next in this series:\n\\[\\cdots+\\frac{n^{5}}{5^{n}}+\\frac{(n+1)^{5}}{5^{n+1}}+\\cdots\\]\nThe denominator goes up by a factor of 5, \\(5^{n+1}=5\\cdot 5^{n}\\), but the numerator goes up by much less: \\((n+1)^{5}=n^{5}+5n^{4}+10n^{3}+10n^{2}+5n+1\\), which is much less than \\(5n^{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large, because \\(5n^{4}\\) is much less than \\(n^{5}\\).

Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}1/n^{4}\\) is a convergent \\(p\\)-series, \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}5/n^{4}\\) converges also. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 11.3.7** Show that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) diverges.\nThis also follows from theorem 11.2.2: Since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) is a \\(p\\)-series with \\(p=1/2<1\\), it diverges, and so does \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). \\(\\Box\\)\nSince it is typically difficult to compute the value of a series exactly, a good approximation is frequently required. In a real sense, a good approximation is only as good as we know it is, that is, while an approximation may in fact be good, it is only valuable in practice if we can guarantee its accuracy to some degree. This guarantee is usually easy to come by for series with decreasing positive terms.\n**Example 11.3.8** Approximate \\(\\sum 1/n^{2}\\) to two decimal places.\nReferring to figure 11.3.1, if we approximate the sum by \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}1/n^{2}\\), the error we make is the total area of the remaining rectangles, all of which lie under the curve \\(1/x^{2}\\) from \\(x=N\\) out to infinity. So we know the true value of the series is larger than the approximation, and no bigger than the approximation plus the area under the curve from \\(N\\) to infinity.

Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If \\(\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}=0\\) then also \\(\\ddot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=0\\), by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}\\). We want this to be \\(f(t)\\), that is, we need \\(\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2}=f(t)\\). So we would very much like these equations to be true:\n\\[\\dot{u}y_{1}+\\dot{v}y_{2} =0\\] \\[\\dot{u}\\dot{y}_{1}+\\dot{v}\\dot{y}_{2} =f(t).\\]\nThis is a system of two equations in the two unknowns \\(\\dot{u}\\) and \\(\\dot{v}\\), so we can solve as usual to get \\(\\dot{u}=g(t)\\) and \\(\\dot{v}=h(t)\\). Then we can find \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works out and is worth a try.\n**Example 17.7.1**: Consider the equation \\(\\ddot{y}-5\\dot{y}+6y=\\sin t\\). We can solve this by the method of undetermined coefficients, but we will use variation of parameters. The solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{2t}+Be^{3t}\\), so the simultaneous equations to be solved are\n\\[\\dot{u}e^{2t}+\\dot{v}e^{3t} =0\\] \\[2\\dot{u}e^{2t}+3\\dot{v}e^{3t} =\\sin t.\\]\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[\\eqalign{g^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)g(t)&=y_{1}^{\\prime}-y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)(y_{1}-y_{2 })\\cr&=(y_{1}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{1})-(y_{2}^{\\prime}+p(t)y_{2})\\cr&=f(t)-f(t)=0.}\\]\nIn other words, \\(g(t)=y_{1}-y_{2}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Turning this around, any solution to the linear equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\), call it \\(y_{1}\\), can be written as \\(y_{2}+g(t)\\), for some particular \\(y_{2}\\) and some solution \\(g(t)\\) of the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\). Since we already know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) will give us all of them.\nHow might we find that one particular solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\)? Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\n\n",

The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the **squeeze theorem**.\n##### 4.3.1 Squeeze Theorem\nSuppose that \\(g(x)\\leq f(x)\\leq h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) close to \\(a\\) but not equal to \\(a\\). If \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}g(x)=L=\\lim_{x\\to a}h(x)\\), then \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\).\nThis theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won't prove it here, but point out that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that \\(f(x)\\) is trapped between \\(g(x)\\) below and \\(h(x)\\) above, and that at \\(x=a\\), both \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) approach the same value. This means the situation looks something like figure 4.3.1. The wiggly curve is \\(x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\), the upper and lower curves are \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(-x^{2}\\). Since the sine function is always between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), \\(-x^{2}\\leq x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)\\leq x^{2}\\), and it is easy to see that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^{2}=0=\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\). It is not so easy to see directly, that is algebraically, that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}x^{2}\\sin(\\pi/x)=0\\), because the \\(\\pi/x\\) prevents us from simply plugging in \\(x=0\\). The squeeze theorem makes this \"hard limit\" as easy as the trivial limits involving \\(x^{2}\\).\nTo do the hard limit that we want, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}(\\sin x)/x\\), we will find two simpler functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(g(x)\\leq(\\sin x)/x\\leq h(x)\\), and so that \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)=\\lim_{x\\to 0}h(x)\\).

We know that \\(z\\) has two square roots, and in keeping with the notation in Theorem 11.17, we'll call them \\(w_{0}\\) and \\(w_{1}\\). We get \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt{4}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{(2\\pi/3)}{2}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{2}(0)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt{4}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{(2\\pi/3)}{2}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{2}(1)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\right)\\). In rectangular form, the two square roots of \\(z\\) are \\(w_{0}=1+i\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(w_{1}=-1-i\\sqrt{3}\\). We can check our answers by squaring them and showing that we get \\(z=-2+2i\\sqrt{3}\\).\n2. Proceeding as above, we get \\(z=-16=16\\mathrm{cis}(\\pi)\\). With \\(r=16\\), \\(\\theta=\\pi\\) and \\(n=4\\), we get the four fourth roots of \\(z\\) to be \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(0)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), \\(w_{1}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(1)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(2)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{5\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{3}=\\sqrt[4]{16}\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{4}+\\tfrac{2\\pi}{4}(3)\\right) =2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\tfrac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)\\). Converting these to rectangular form gives \\(w_{0}=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(w_{1}=-\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(w_{2}=-\\sqrt{2}-i\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}=\\sqrt{2}-i\\sqrt{2}\\).\n3. For \\(z=\\sqrt{2}+i\\sqrt{2}\\), we have \\(z=2\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\).

If we were to convert these to rectangular form, we would need to use either the Sum and Difference Identities in Theorem 10.16 or the Half-Angle Identities in Theorem 10.19 to evaluate \\(w_{0}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\). Since we are not explicitly told to do so, we leave this as a good, but messy, exercise.\n4. To find the five fifth roots of \\(1\\), we write \\(1=1\\mathrm{cis}(0)\\). We have \\(r=1\\), \\(\\theta=0\\) and \\(n=5\\). Since \\(\\sqrt[5]{1}=1\\), the roots are \\(w_{0}=\\mathrm{cis}(0)=1\\), \\(w_{1}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{2}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\right)\\), \\(w_{3}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{5}\\right)\\) and \\(w_{4}=\\mathrm{cis}\\left(\\frac{8\\pi}{5}\\right)\\). The situation here is even graver than in the previous example, since we have not developed any identities to help us determine the cosine or sine of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}\\). At this stage, we could approximate our answers using a calculator, and we leave this as an exercise.\n\n\n",

To find the domain of \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\), we proceed as above. Since the domain of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) is defined for all \\(x\\), we get that the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of \\(G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\), like that of \\(F(x)=\\arctan(x)\\), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=\\pi\\). Following Theorem 1.7, we graph \\(y=g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) starting with \\(y=G(x)=\\arccos(x)\\) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of \\(2\\) and following that with a vertical shift upwards by \\(\\pi\\). This latter transformation is the one which affects the range, making it now \\((\\pi,2\\pi)\\). To check this graphically, we encounter a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite \\(g(x)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+\\pi\\) in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have that \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\) when \\(\\frac{x}{2}>0\\), or, in this case, when \\(x>0\\). Hence, for \\(x>0\\), we have \\(g(x)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi\\). When \\(\\frac{x}{2}<0\\), we can use the same argument in number 1c that gave us \\(\\arccos(-2)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) to give us \\(\\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)\\).\nHence, for \\(x<0\\), \\(g(x)=\\pi+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+\\pi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{x}\\right)+2\\pi\\). What about \\(x=0\\)? We know \\(g(0)=\\operatorname{arccot}(0)+\\pi=\\pi\\), and neither of the formulas for \\(g\\) involving arctangent will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph \\(y=g(x)\\) on our calculators, we need to write it as a piecewise defined function:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Suppose the curve \\(z=x\\) in the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) plane is rotated around the \\(z\\) axis.

When constructing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1. As \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\to 1^{-}\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\to 0^{+}\\), so that \\(\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\to\\infty\\) producing a vertical asymptote at \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Using a similar analysis, we get that as \\(x\\to\\frac{\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\); as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{-}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to\\infty\\); and as \\(x\\to\\frac{3\\pi}{2}^{+}\\), \\(\\tan(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Plotting this information and performing the usual 'copy and paste' produces:\nThe graph of \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\nFrom the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\). To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\). To show that it is exactly \\(\\pi\\), suppose \\(p\\) is a positive real number so that \\(\\tan(x+p)=\\tan(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\). For \\(x=0\\), we have \\(\\tan(p)=\\tan(0+p)=\\tan(0)=0\\), which means \\(p\\) is a multiple of \\(\\pi\\). The smallest positive multiple of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi\\) itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for \\(y=\\tan(x)\\) the interval \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\), and use as our 'quarter marks' \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). From the graph, we see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.\nIt should be no surprise that \\(K(x)=\\cot(x)\\) behaves similarly to \\(J(x)=\\tan(x)\\). Plotting \\(\\cot(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,2\\pi]\\) results in the graph below.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}\\hline x&\\cot(x)&(x,\\cot(x))\\\\ \\hline 0&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\frac{5\\pi}{4}&1&\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},1\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{3\\pi}{2}&0&\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},0\\right)\\\\ \\hline\\frac{7\\pi}{4}&-1&\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{4},-1\\right)\\\\ \\hline 2\\pi&\\text{undefined}&\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\]\nThe graph of \\(y=\\cot(x)\\) over \\([0,2\\pi]\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n5. We begin this problem in the same manner we began the previous two problems. To help us see the forest for the trees, we let \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\), so our goal is to find a way to express \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\tan(t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\), we know \\(\\cos(t)=x\\) where \\(0\\leq t\\leq\\pi\\), but since we are after an expression for \\(\\tan(t)\\), we know we need to throw out \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) from consideration. Hence, either \\(0\\leq t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t\\leq\\pi\\) so that, geometrically, \\(t\\) corresponds to an angle in Quadrant I or Quadrant II. One approach3 to finding \\(\\tan(t)\\) is to use the quotient identity \\(\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\cos(t)}\\). Substituting \\(\\cos(t)=x\\) into the Pythagorean Identity \\(\\cos^{2}(t)+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\) gives \\(x^{2}+\\sin^{2}(t)=1\\), from which we get \\(\\sin(t)=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Since \\(t\\) corresponds to angles in Quadrants I and II, \\(\\sin(t)\\geq 0\\), so we choose \\(\\sin(t)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\). Thus, Footnote 3: Alternatively, we could use the identity: \\(1+\\tan^{2}(t)=\\sec^{2}(t)\\). Since \\(x=\\cos(t)\\), \\(\\sec(t)=\\frac{1}{\\cos(t)}=\\frac{1}{x}\\). The reader is invited to work through this approach to see what, if any, difficulties arise. \\[\\tan(t)=\\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\cos(t)}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\] To determine the values of \\(x\\) for which this equivalence is valid, we consider our substitution \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\). Since the domain of \\(\\arccos(x)\\) is \\([-1,1]\\), we know we must restrict \\(-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\). Additionally, since we had to discard \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we need to discard \\(x=\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=0\\). Hence, \\(\\tan\\left(\\arccos\\left(x\\right)\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{x}\\) is valid for \\(x\\) in \\([-1,0)\\cup(0,1]\\).\n4. We proceed as in the previous problem by writing \\(t=\\arccos(x)\\) so that \\(t\\) lies in the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]\\) with \\(\\sin(t)=x\\). We aim to express \\(\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=\\cos(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Since \\(\\cos(2t)\\) is defined everywhere, we get no additional restrictions on \\(t\\) as we did in the previous problem. We have three choices for rewriting \\(\\cos(2t)\\): \\(\\cos^{2}(t)-\\sin^{2}(t)\\), \\(2\\cos^{2}(t)-1\\) and \\(1-2\\sin^{2}(t)\\). Since we know \\(x=\\sin(t)\\), it is easiest to use the last form: \\[\\cos\\left(2\\arcsin(x)\\right)=\\cos(2t)=1-2\\sin^{2}(t)=1-2x^{2}\\]\n\n\n",

What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn this series the sizes of the terms decrease, that is, \\(|a_{n}|\\) forms a decreasing sequence, but this is not required in an alternating series. As with positive term series, however, when the terms do have decreasing sizes it is easier to analyze the series, much easier, in fact, than positive term series. Consider pictorially what is going on in the alternating harmonic series, shown in figure 11.4.1. Because the sizes of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) are decreasing, the partial sums \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and since the \"jumps\" (that is, the \\(a_{i}\\) terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums \\(s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\\dots\\) converges as well.\nThere's nothing special about the alternating harmonic series--the same argument works for any alternating sequence with decreasing size terms. The alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.\n**THEOREM 11.4.1** Suppose that \\(\\{a_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\). Then the alternating series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\\) converges.\n_Proof._ The odd numbered partial sums, \\(s_{1}\\), \\(s_{3}\\), \\(s_{5}\\), and so on, form a non-increasing sequence, because \\(s_{2k+3}=s_{2k+1}-a_{2k+2}+a_{2k+3}\\leq s_{2k+1}\\), since \\(a_{2k+2}\\geq a_{2k+3}\\). This\nFigure 11.4.1: The alternating harmonic series.\nsequence is bounded below by \\(s_{2}\\), so it must converge, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=L\\). Likewise, the partial sums \\(s_{2}\\), \\(s_{4}\\), \\(s_{6}\\), and so on, form a non-decreasing sequence that is bounded above by \\(s_{1}\\), so this sequence also converges, say \\(\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k}=M\\). Since \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_{n}=0\\) and \\(s_{2k+1}=s_{2k}+a_{2k+1}\\),\n\\[L=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}s_{2k+1}=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}(s_{2k}+a_{2k+1})=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty }s_{2k}+\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}a_{2k+1}=M+0=M,\\]\nso \\(L=M\\), the two sequences of partial sums converge to the same limit, and this means the entire sequence of partial sums also converges to \\(L\\).\nAnother useful fact is implicit in this discussion.

Figure 6.4.1 shows a tangent line to \\(y=x^{2}\\) at three different magnifications.\nIf we want to approximate \\(f(b)\\), because computing it exactly is difficult, we can approximate the value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some \\(a\\) close to \\(b\\).\n**Example 6.4.1**: Let \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x+4}\\).

This rounds to 3.17 while the square root of 10 is actually 3.16 to two decimal places, so this estimate is only accurate to one decimal place. This is not too surprising, as 10 is really not very close to 9; on the other hand, for many calculations, 3.2 would be accurate enough. \\(\\Box\\)\nWith modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations.

Since the argument of cosine here is \\(2x\\), this means \\(2x=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(2x=\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To check these answers analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer \\(k\\) we have \\[\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{5\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right)\\] (the period of cosine is \\[2\\pi\\] ) \\[= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\nSimilarly, we find \\(\\cos\\left(2\\left[\\frac{7\\pi}{12}+\\pi k\\right]\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+2 \\pi k\\right)=\\cos\\left(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}\\right)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). To determine which of our solutions lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\), we substitute integer values for \\(k\\). The solutions we keep come from the values of \\(k=0\\) and \\(k=1\\) and are \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{12}\\), \\(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{19\\pi}{12}\\). Using a calculator, we graph \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) over \\([0,2\\pi)\\) and examine where these two graphs intersect. We see that the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the decimal representations of our exact answers.\n2. Since this equation has the form \\(\\csc(u)=\\sqrt{2}\\), we rewrite this as \\(\\sin(u)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and find \\(u=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(u=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\).

To check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify. Footnote 3: Do you see why? \\[\\csc\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{15\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\right]-\\pi\\right) = \\csc\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k-\\pi\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}+2\\pi k\\right)\\] \\[= \\csc\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\] \\[= \\sqrt{2}\\] (the period of cosecant is \\[2\\pi\\] ) The family \\(x=\\frac{21\\pi}{4}+6\\pi k\\) checks similarly. Despite having infinitely many solutions, we find that _none_ of them lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). To verify this graphically, we use a reciprocal identity to rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that \\(y=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x-\\pi\\right)}\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{2}\\) do not intersect at all over the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThis gives \\(u=-1\\) or \\(u=2\\). Since \\(u=\\tan(x)\\), we have \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\) or \\(\\tan(x)=2\\). From \\(\\tan(x)=-1\\), we get \\(x=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). To solve \\(\\tan(x)=2\\), we employ the arctangent function and get \\(x=\\arctan(2)+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From the first set of solutions, we get \\(x=\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x=\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\) as our answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using the same sort of argument we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get \\(x=\\arctan(2)\\) and \\(x=\\pi+\\arctan(2)\\) as answers from our second set of solutions which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant as a cosine and graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{(\\cos(x))^{2}}\\) and \\(y=\\tan(x)+3\\) to find the \\(x\\)-values of the points where they intersect.\n3. In the equation \\(\\cos(2x)=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\), we obtain a 'quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past. \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\cos(2x)&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\\\ 2\\cos^{2}(x)-1&=&3\\cos(x)-2\\end{array}\\] (Since \\(\\cos(2x)=2\\cos^{2}(x)-1\\).) \\[\\begin{array}{rcl}2\\cos^{2}(x)-3\\cos(x)+1&=&0\\\\ 2u^{2}-3u+1&=&0\\end{array}\\] Let \\(u=\\cos(x)\\). This gives \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(u=1\\). Since \\(u=\\cos(x)\\), we get \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(\\cos(x)=1\\). Solving \\(\\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\), we get \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) or \\(x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}+2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). From \\(\\cos(x)=1\\), we get \\(x=2\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). The answers which lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\) are \\(x=0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), and \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). Graphing \\(y=\\cos(2x)\\) and \\(y=3\\cos(x)-2\\), we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect in three places on \\([0,2\\pi)\\), and the \\(x\\)-coordinates of these points confirm our results.\n\n\n",

Of course, if \\(a=0\\) this is really a first order equation, so we assume \\(a\\neq 0\\). Also, much as in exercise 20 of section 17.5, if \\(c=0\\) we can solve the related first order equation \\(a\\dot{h}+bh=f(t)\\), and then solve \\(h=\\dot{y}\\) for \\(y\\). So we will only examine examples in which \\(c\\neq 0\\).\nSuppose that \\(y_{1}(t)\\) and \\(y_{2}(t)\\) are solutions to \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=f(t)\\), and consider the function \\(h=y_{1}-y_{2}\\). We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:\n\\[a(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime\\prime}+b(y_{1}-y_{2})^{\\prime}+c(y_{1}-y_{2})=ay_{1}^{ \\prime\\prime}+by_{1}^{\\prime}+cy_{1}-(ay_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}+by_{2}^{\\prime}+ cy_{2})=f(t)-f(t)=0.\\]\nSo \\(h\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation \\(a\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+cy=0\\). Since we know how to find all such \\(h\\), then with just one particular solution \\(y_{2}\\) we can express all possible solutions \\(y_{1}\\), namely, \\(y_{1}=h+y_{2}\\), where now \\(h\\) is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we approached the first order linear equation.\nTo make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution \\(y_{2}\\). This turns out to be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if \\(f(t)\\) is of a certain simple form, we can find a solution using the **method of undetermined coefficients**, sometimes more whimsically called the **method of judicious guessing**.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* Find the solution for the mass-spring equation \\(3\\ddot{y}+12\\dot{y}+24y=2\\sin t\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\n* Consider the differential equation \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=\\cos(\\omega t)\\), with \\(m\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\) all positive and \\(b^{2}<2mk\\); this equation is a model for a damped mass-spring system with external driving force \\(\\cos(\\omega t)\\).

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n2. Proceeding as before, we determine the domain of \\(g\\) by solving \\(x+1=0\\). As before, we find the domain of \\(g\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,\\infty)\\). To write \\(g(x)\\) in the form requested, we need to get a common denominator \\[g(x) = 2-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\qquad=\\ \\ \\frac{2}{1}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2)(x+1)}{(1)(x+1)}-\\frac{3}{x+1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x+2)-3}{x+1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\] This formula is now completely simplified.\n3. The denominators in the formula for \\(h(x)\\) are both \\(x^{2}-1\\) whose zeros are \\(x=\\pm 1\\). As a result, the domain of \\(h\\) is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,1)\\cup(1,\\infty)\\). We now proceed to simplify \\(h(x)\\). Since we have the same denominator in both terms, we subtract the numerators. We then factor the resulting numerator and denominator, and cancel out the common factor. \\[h(x) = \\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}-\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{\\left(2x^{2}-1\\right)-(3x-2)}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-1-3x+2}{x^{2}-1}\\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{2x^{2}-3x+1}{x^{2}-1}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\ \\ \\ =\\ \\ \\frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\\] \\[= \\ \\frac{2x-1}{x+1}\\]\n4. To find the domain of \\(r\\), it may help to temporarily rewrite \\(r(x)\\) as \\[r(x)=\\frac{\\frac{2x^{2}-1}{x^{2}-1}}{\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}}\\] We need to set all of the denominators equal to zero which means we need to solve not only \\(x^{2}-1=0\\), but also \\(\\frac{3x-2}{x^{2}-1}=0\\). We find \\(x=\\pm 1\\) for the former and \\(x=\\frac{2}{3}\\) for the latter. Our domain is \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup\\left(-1,\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{2}{3},1\\right)\\cup (1,\\infty)\\). We simplify \\(r(x)\\) by rewriting the division as multiplication by the reciprocal and then by canceling the common factor\n\n\n",

In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding \\(\\nabla\\times{\\bf F}\\) entirely. \\(\\Box\\)\n**EXAMPLE 16.8.5** Let \\({\\bf F}=\\langle-y^{2},x,z^{2}\\rangle\\), and let the curve \\(C\\) be the intersection of the cylinder \\(x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\) with the plane \\(y+z=2\\), oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above.

Again, it turns out that what we already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=0\\) looks like \\(Ae^{P(t)}\\). We now make an inspired guess: consider the function \\(v(t)e^{P(t)}\\), in which we have replaced the constant parameter \\(A\\) with the function \\(v(t)\\). This technique is called **variation of parameters**. For convenience write this as \\(s(t)=v(t)h(t)\\) where \\(h(t)=e^{P(t)}\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. Now let's compute a bit with \\(s(t)\\):\n\\[\\eqalign{s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)&=v(t)h^{\\prime}(t)+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)+p(t)v(t)h (t)\\cr&=v(t)(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t))+v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)\\cr&=v^{\\prime}(t)h(t).}\\]\nThe last equality is true because \\(h^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)h(t)=0\\), since \\(h(t)\\) is a solution to the homogeneous equation. We are hoping to find a function \\(s(t)\\) so that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)+p(t)s(t)=f(t)\\); we will have such a function if we can arrange to have \\(v^{\\prime}(t)h(t)=f(t)\\), that is, \\(v^{\\prime}(t)=f(t)/h(t)\\). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an anti-derivative of \\(f(t)/h(t)\\). Putting this all together, the general solution to \\(\\dot{y}+p(t)y=f(t)\\) is\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.4** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+7\\dot{y}+10y=e^{-2t}\\). Following the last example we might guess \\(Ce^{-2t}\\), but since this is a solution to the homogeneous equation it cannot work. Instead we guess \\(Cte^{-2t}\\). Then\n\\[(-2Ce^{-2t}-2Ce^{-2t}+4Cte^{-2t})+7(Ce^{-2t}-2Cte^{-2t})+10Cte^{-2t}=e^{-2t}(-3C).\\]\nThen \\(C=-1/3\\) and the solution is \\(Ae^{-5t}+Be^{-2t}-(1/3)te^{-2t}\\).\nIn general, if \\(f(t)=e^{kt}\\) and \\(k\\) is one of the roots of the characteristic equation, then we guess \\(Cte^{kt}\\) instead of \\(Ce^{kt}\\). If \\(k\\) is the only root of the characteristic equation, then \\(Cte^{kt}\\) will not work, and we must guess \\(Ct^{2}e^{kt}\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.5** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}-6\\dot{y}+9y=e^{3t}\\). The characteristic equation is \\(r^{2}-6r+9=(r-3)^{2}\\), so the general solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(Ae^{3t}+Bte^{3t}\\). Guessing \\(Ct^{2}e^{3t}\\) for the particular solution, we get\n\\[(9Ct^{2}e^{3t}+6Cte^{3t}+6Cte^{3t}+2Ce^{3t})-6(3Ct^{2}e^{3t}+2Cte^{3t})+9Ct^{2} e^{3t}=e^{3t}2C.\\]\nThe solution is thus \\(Ae^{3t}+Bte^{3t}+(1/2)t^{2}e^{3t}\\).\nIt is common in various physical systems to encounter an \\(f(t)\\) of the form \\(a\\cos(\\omega t)+b\\sin(\\omega t)\\).\n**EXAMPLE 17.6.6** Find the general solution to \\(\\ddot{y}+6\\dot{y}+25y=\\cos(4t)\\). The roots of the characteristic equation are \\(-3\\pm 4i\\), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\). For a particular solution, we guess \\(C\\cos(4t)+D\\sin(4t)\\). Substituting as usual:\n\\[\\eqalign{(-16C\\cos(4t)&+-16D\\sin(4t))+6(-4C\\sin(4t)+4D\\cos(4t))+25(C\\cos(4t)+ D\\sin(4t))\\cr&=(24D+9C)\\cos(4t)+(-24C+9D)\\sin(4t).\\cr}\\]\nTo make this equal to \\(\\cos(4t)\\) we need\n\\[\\eqalign{24D+9C&=1\\cr 9D-24C&=0\\cr}\\]\nwhich gives \\(C=1/73\\) and \\(D=8/219\\). The full solution is then \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))+(1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\).\n**476**: **Chapter 17 Differential Equations**\nThe function \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\) is a damped oscillation as in example 17.5.3, while \\((1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\) is a simple undamped oscillation. As \\(t\\) increases, the sum \\(e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))\\) approaches zero, so the solution\n\\[e^{-3t}(A\\cos(4t)+B\\sin(4t))+(1/73)\\cos(4t)+(8/219)\\sin(4t)\\]\n\n\n",

Hence, \\(f^{-1}\\) should 1. add 3 2. take the logarithm base 2 3. add 1 In symbols, \\(f^{-1}(x)=\\log_{2}(x+3)+1\\).\n\n\n",

Is the lone local maximum a global maximum? Here we must look more closely at the graph. We know that on the closed interval \\([-\\sqrt{3}/3,\\sqrt{3}/3]\\) there is a global maximum at \\(x=-\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and a global minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\). So the question becomes: what happens between \\(-2\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\)? Since there is a local minimum at \\(x=\\sqrt{3}/3\\), the graph must continue up to the right, since there are no more critical values. This means no value of \\(f\\) will be less than \\(-2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) between \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) and \\(2\\), but it says nothing about whether we might find a value larger than the local maximum \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\). How can we tell? Since the function increases to the right of \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\), we need to know what the function values do \"close to\" \\(2\\). Here the easiest test is to pick a number and do a computation to get some idea of what's going on. Since \\(f(1.9)=4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\), there is no global maximum at \\(-\\sqrt{3}/3\\), and hence no global maximum at all. (How can we tell that \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\)? We can use a calculator to approximate the right hand side; if it is not even close to \\(4.959\\) we can take this as decisive. Since \\(2\\sqrt{3}/9\\approx 0.3849\\), there's really no question. Funny things can happen in the rounding done by computers and calculators, however, so we might be a little more careful, especially if the values come out quite close. In this case we can convert the relation \\(4.959>2\\sqrt{3}/9\\) into \\((9/2)4.959>\\sqrt{3}\\) and ask whether this is true. Since the left side is clearly larger than \\(4\\cdot 4\\) which is clearly larger than \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), this settles the question.)\n\n\n",

Since \\(x=-3\\) continues to make trouble in the denominator, we know the line \\(x=-3\\) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\). Since \\(x=3\\) no longer produces a \\(0\\) in the denominator, we have a hole at \\(x=3\\). To find the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the hole, we substitute \\(x=3\\) into \\(\\frac{x+2}{x+3}\\) and find the hole is at \\(\\left(3,\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\). When we graph \\(y=g(x)\\) using a calculator, we clearly see the vertical asymptote at \\(x=-3\\), but everything seems calm near \\(x=3\\). Hence, as \\(x\\to-3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\infty\\), as \\(x\\to-3^{+}\\), \\(g(x)\\to-\\infty\\), as \\(x\\to 3^{-}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\frac{5}{6}^{-}\\), and as \\(x\\to 3^{+}\\), \\(g(x)\\to\\frac{5}{6}^{+}\\).\n3. The domain of \\(h\\) is all real numbers, since \\(x^{2}+9=0\\) has no real solutions. Accordingly, the graph of \\(y=h(x)\\) is devoid of both vertical asymptotes and holes.\n\n\n",

(Finding the maximum values of the second and fourth derivatives can be challenging for some of these; you may use a graphing calculator or computer software to estimate the maximum values.) If you have access to Sage or similar software, approximate each integral to two decimal places. You can use this Sage worksheet to get started.\n1. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}x\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 2. \\(\\int_{0}^{3}x^{2}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 4. \\(\\int_{1}^{3}\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 5. \\(\\int_{1}^{2}\\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 6. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}x\\sqrt{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 7. \\(\\int_{1}^{5}\\frac{x}{1+x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 8. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{3}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 9. \\(\\int_{0}^{1}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\) 10. \\(\\int_{1}^{4}\\sqrt{1+1/x}\\,dx\\Rightarrow\\)\n11. Using Simpson's rule on a parabola \\(f(x)\\), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate \\(f\\) will be \\(f\\) itself. Remarkably, Simpson's rule also computes the integral of a cubic function \\(f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d\\) exactly. Show this is true by showing that \\[\\int_{x_{0}}^{x_{2}}f(x)\\,dx=\\frac{x_{2}-x_{0}}{3\\cdot 2}(f(x_{0})+4f((x_{0}+x_{ 2})/2)+f(x_{2})).\\] Note that the right hand side of this equation is exactly the Simpson approximation for the cubic. This does require a bit of messy algebra, so you may prefer to use Sage.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow the sum of the areas under all parabolas is\n\\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+f(x _{4})+\\cdots+f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n}))=\\] \\[{\\Delta x\\over 3}(f(x_{0})+4f(x_{1})+2f(x_{2})+4f(x_{3})+2f(x _{4})+\\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_{n})).\\]\nThis is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients; note that \\(n\\) must be even for this to make sense. This approximation technique is referred to as **Simpson's Rule**.\nAs with the trapezoid method, this is useful only with an error estimate:\n**Theorem 8.6.3**: Suppose \\(f\\) has a fourth derivative \\(f^{(4)}\\) everywhere on the interval \\([a,b]\\), and \\(|f^{(4)}(x)|\\leq M\\) for all \\(x\\) in the interval. With \\(\\Delta x=(b-a)/n\\), an error estimate for Simpson's approximation is\n\\[E(\\Delta x)=\\frac{b-a}{180}M(\\Delta x)^{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{5}}{180n^{4}}M.\\]\n**Example 8.6.4**: Let us again approximate \\(\\int_{0}^{1}e^{-x^{2}}\\,dx\\) to two decimal places. The fourth derivative of \\(f=e^{-x^{2}}\\) is \\((16x^{4}-48x^{2}+12)e^{-x^{2}}\\); on \\([0,1]\\) this is at most 12 in absolute value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.005\\), but taking a cue from our earlier example, let's require \\(E(\\Delta x)<0.001\\):\n\\[\\frac{1}{180}(12)\\frac{1}{n^{4}} <0.001\\] \\[\\frac{200}{3} <n^{4}\\] \\[2.86\\approx\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{200}{3}} <n\\]\nSo we try \\(n=4\\), since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error estimate is \\(12/180/4^{4}<0.0003\\) and the approximation is\n\n\n",

The slope of the tangent line is \\(f_{x}(a,b)\\), so\n\\[f_{x}(a,b)={w\\over u}={w\\over 1}=w.\\]\nIn other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is \\(\\langle 1,0,f_{x}(a,b)\\rangle\\), as shown in figure 14.3.4. If we repeat the reasoning for the tangent line above \\(x=a\\), we get the vector \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}(a,b)\\rangle\\).\nNow to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, \\(\\langle 0,1,f_{y}\\rangle\\times\\langle 1,0,f_{x}\\rangle=\\langle f_{x},f_{y},-1\\rangle\\). From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: \\(f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=k\\), and \\(k\\) as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: \\(f_{x}(a,b)(a)+f_{y}(a,b)(b)-c=k\\). There are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:\n\\[\\eqalign{&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_{y}(a,b)y-z=f_{x}(a,b)a+f_{y}(a,b)b-c\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)x+f_ {y}(a,b)y-f_{x}(a,b)a-f_{y}(a,b)b+c=z\\cr&f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+c=z\\cr&f_{ x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)+f(a,b)=z\\cr}\\]\n**Example 14.3.3**Find the plane tangent to \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4\\) at \\((1,1,\\sqrt{2})\\).

This is true _if the tangent plane exists_. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if \\(f_{x}\\) and \\(f_{y}\\) exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function \\(xy^{2}/(x^{2}+y^{4})\\) pictured in figure 14.2.1. This function has value \\(0\\) when \\(x=0\\) or \\(y=0\\), and we can \"plug the hole\" by agreeing that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). Now it's clear that \\(f_{x}(0,0)=f_{y}(0,0)=0\\), because in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it's also clear from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a \"tangent plane\" at the origin, certainly not the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane containing these two tangent lines.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1.

The exponents on each term must add to \\(5\\) and if the exponent on \\(x\\) is \\(3\\), the exponent on \\(y\\) must be \\(2\\). Plucking out the term \\(j=2\\), we get \\[\\binom{5}{2}(2x)^{5-2}y^{2}=10(2x)^{3}y^{2}=80x^{3}y^{2}\\]\nWe close this section with Pascal's Triangle, named in honor of the mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal's Triangle is obtained by arranging the binomial coefficients in the triangular fashion below.\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 3\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nSince \\(\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}=1\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ n\\end{pmatrix}=1\\) for all whole numbers \\(n\\), we get that each row of Pascal's Triangle begins and ends with 1. To generate the numbers in the middle of the rows (from the third row onwards), we take advantage of the additive relationship expressed in Theorem 9.3. For instance, \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\\) and so forth. This relationship is indicated by the arrows in the array above. With these two facts in hand, we can quickly generate Pascal's Triangle. We start with the first two rows, 1 and 1 1. From that point on, each successive row begins and ends with 1 and the middle numbers are generated using Theorem 9.3. Below we attempt to demonstrate this building process to generate the first five rows of Pascal's Triangle.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nDefine f(x)=(4x+5)/(9-3x), is the function continuous at x=-1?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n\\(\\Box\\)\nRecall that a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\); roughly this says that there is no \"hole\" or \"jump\" at \\(x=a\\). We can say exactly the same thing about a function of two variables.\n**Definition 14.2.4**: \\(f(x,y)\\) is continuous at \\((a,b)\\) if \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 14.2.5**: The function \\(f(x,y)=3x^{2}y/(x^{2}+y^{2})\\) is not continuous at \\((0,0)\\), because \\(f(0,0)\\) is not defined. However, we know that \\(\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0\\), so we can easily \"fix\" the problem, by extending the definition of \\(f\\) so that \\(f(0,0)=0\\). This surface is shown in figure 14.2.2. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 14.2.2**: \\(f(x,y)={3x^{2}y\\over x^{2}+y^{2}}\\) (AP)\nNote that in contrast to this example we cannot fix example 14.2.1 at \\((0,0)\\) because the limit does not exist. No matter what value we try to assign to \\(f\\) at \\((0,0)\\) the surface will have a \"jump\" there.\nFortunately, the functions we will examine will typically be continuous almost everywhere. Usually this follows easily from the fact that closely related functions of one variable are continuous. As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form \\(ax^{m}y^{n}\\), where \\(a\\) is a real number and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSo the derivative of \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is NOT as simple as \\(f^{\\prime}(x)g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Surely there is some rule for such a situation? There is, and it is instructive to \"discover\" it by trying to do the general calculation even without knowing the answer in advance.\n\\[\\eqalign{{d\\over dx}&(f(x)g(x))=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x )-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)+f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x+\\Delta x)-f(x+\\Delta x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+ \\Delta x)g(x)-f(x)g(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\cr&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)g(x) \\over\\Delta x}+\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}g(x)\\cr&=f(x)g^{ \\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x)\\cr}\\]\nA couple of items here need discussion. First, we used a standard trick, \"add and subtract the same thing\", to transform what we had into a more useful form. After some rewriting, we realize that we have two limits that produce \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\). Of course, \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) and\n\\(g^{\\prime}(x)\\) must actually exist for this to make sense. We also replaced \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)\\) with \\(f(x)\\)--why is this justified?\nWhat we really need to know here is that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)=f(x)\\), or in the language of section 2.5, that \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x\\). We already know that \\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\) exists (or the whole approach, writing the derivative of \\(fg\\) in terms of \\(f^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g^{\\prime}\\), doesn't make sense). This turns out to imply that \\(f\\) is continuous as well. Here's why:\n\\[\\eqalign{\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}f(x+\\Delta x)&=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)+f(x))\\cr &=\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)\\over\\Delta x}\\Delta x+\\lim_{ \\Delta x\\to 0}f(x)\\cr&=f^{\\prime}(x)\\cdot 0+f(x)=f(x)\\cr}\\]\nTo summarize: the product rule says that\n\\[{d\\over dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g^{\\prime}(x)+f^{\\prime}(x)g(x).\\]\n\n\n",

What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here's the calculation:\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}<1+\\int_{1}^{n}{1 \\over x}\\,dx<1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=1+\\infty.\\]\nThe problem is that the improper integral doesn't converge. Note well that this does _not_ prove that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however, allows us to prove in a second way that \\(\\sum 1/n\\) diverges.\n**EXAMPLE 11.3.2** Consider a slightly altered version of figure 11.3.1, shown in figure 11.3.2.\nThe rectangles this time are above the curve, that is, each rectangle completely contains the corresponding area under the curve. This means that\n\\[s_{n}={1\\over 1}+{1\\over 2}+{1\\over 3}+\\cdots+{1\\over n}>\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1 \\over x}\\,dx=\\ln x\\Big{|}_{1}^{n+1}=\\ln(n+1).\\]\nAs \\(n\\) gets bigger, \\(\\ln(n+1)\\) goes to infinity, so the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) must also go to infinity, so the harmonic series diverges. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Figure 11.3.2** Graph of \\(y=1/x\\) with rectangles.\nThe important fact that clinches this example is that\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{1}^{n+1}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty,\\]\nwhich we can rewrite as\n\\[\\int_{1}^{\\infty}{1\\over x}\\,dx=\\infty.\\]\nSo these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the **integral test**, which we state as a theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nits terms are less than or equal to the terms of the sequence\n\\[a_{N}+{a_{N}\\over 2}+{a_{N}\\over 4}+{a_{N}\\over 8}+\\cdots+{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}+ \\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}{a_{N}\\over 2^{k}}=2a_{N}.\\]\nSo by the comparison test, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{N+k}\\) converges, and this means that \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_{n}\\) converges, since we've just added the fixed number \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{N-1}\\).\nUnder what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of \\(a_{n+1}/a_{n}\\), say \\(L\\), was less than 1 so that we could pick a value \\(r\\) so that \\(L<r<1\\). The fact that \\(L<r\\) (\\(1/5<1/2\\) in our example) means that we can compare the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) to \\(\\sum r^{n}\\), and the fact that \\(r<1\\) guarantees that \\(\\sum r^{n}\\) converges. That's really all that is\nrequired to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and we end up testing for absolute convergence.\n**THEOREM 11.7.1 The Ratio Test**  Suppose that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}|a_{n+1}/a_{n}|=L\\). If \\(L<1\\) the series \\(\\sum a_{n}\\) converges absolutely, if \\(L>1\\) the series diverges, and if \\(L=1\\) this test gives no information.\n_Proof._ The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace \\(1/5\\) by \\(L\\) and \\(1/2\\) by \\(r\\). Suppose that \\(L>1\\), and pick \\(r\\) so that \\(1<r<L\\). Then for \\(n\\geq N\\), for some \\(N\\),\n\n\n",

To prove that this is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:\n\\[\\tan(x+\\pi)=\\frac{\\tan(x)+\\tan(\\pi)}{1-\\tan(x)\\tan(\\pi)}=\\frac{\\tan(x)+0}{1-( \\tan(x))(0)}=\\tan(x),\\]\nwhich tells us the period of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is at most \\(\\pi\\).

The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary.

First we compute the mass:\n\\[M=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}1\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\cos x \\,dx=\\left.\\sin x\\right|_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}=2.\\]\nNext,\n\\[M_{x}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}y\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{2}\\cos^{2}x\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]\nFinally,\n\\[M_{y}=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{\\cos x}x\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}x\\cos x \\,dx=0.\\]\nSo \\(\\bar{x}=0\\) as expected, and \\(\\bar{y}=\\pi/4/2=\\pi/8\\). This is the same problem as in example 9.6.4; it may be helpful to compare the two solutions. \\(\\Box\\)\n**Example 15.3.2**: Find the center of mass of a two-dimensional plate that occupies the quarter circle \\(x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\) in the first quadrant and has density \\(k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\). It seems clear that because of the symmetry of both the region and the density function (both are important!), \\(\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}\\). We'll do both to check our work.\nJumping right in:\n\\[M=\\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}k(x^{2}+y^{2})\\,dy\\,dx=k\\int_{0}^{1}x^{ 2}\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\\frac{(1-x^{2})^{3/2}}{3}\\,dx.\\]\nThis integral is something we can do, but it's a bit unpleasant.

In the cardioid example, we considered only the range \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi\\), and already there was a duplicate: \\((2,0)\\) and \\((2,2\\pi)\\) are the same point. Indeed, every value of \\(\\theta\\) outside the interval \\([0,2\\pi)\\) duplicates a point on the curve \\(r=1+\\cos\\theta\\) when \\(0\\leq\\theta<2\\pi\\). We can even make sense of polar coordinates like \\((-2,\\pi/4)\\): go to the direction \\(\\pi/4\\) and then move a distance \\(2\\) in the opposite direction; see figure 10.1.3. As usual, a negative angle \\(\\theta\\) means an angle measured clockwise from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. The point in figure 10.1.3 also has coordinates \\((2,5\\pi/4)\\) and \\((2,-3\\pi/4)\\).\nThe relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates is quite easy to understand. The point with polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\) has rectangular coordinates \\(x=r\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(y=r\\sin\\theta\\); this follows immediately from the definition of the sine and cosine functions. Using figure 10.1.3 as an example, the point shown has rectangular coordinates\n### Polar Coordinates\nThe point \\((-2,\\pi/4)=(2,5\\pi/4)=(2,-3\\pi/4)\\) in polar coordinates. We merely substitute: \\(r\\sin\\theta=3r\\cos\\theta+2\\), or \\(r=\\frac{2}{\\sin\\theta-3\\cos\\theta}\\).\n**Example 10.1.4**: Find the equation of the circle \\((x-1/2)^{2}+y^{2}=1/4\\) in polar coordinates. Again substituting: \\((r\\cos\\theta-1/2)^{2}+r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta=1/4\\). A bit of algebra turns this into \\(r=\\cos(t)\\). You should try plotting a few \\((r,\\theta)\\) values to convince yourself that this makes sense.\n**Example 10.1.5**: Graph the polar equation \\(r=\\theta\\). Here the distance from the origin exactly matches the angle, so a bit of thought makes it clear that when \\(\\theta\\geq 0\\) we get the spiral of Archimedes in figure 10.1.4. When \\(\\theta<0\\), \\(r\\) is also negative, and so the full graph is the right hand picture in the figure.\nConverting polar equations to rectangular equations can be somewhat trickier, and graphing polar equations directly is also not always easy.\nFigure 10.1.4: The spiral of Archimedes and the full graph of \\(r=\\theta\\).\n\n\n",

The potential disaster for \\(g\\) is if the radicand4 is negative. To avoid this, we set \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\). From this, we get \\(3x\\leq 4\\) or \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\). What this shows is that as long as \\(x\\leq\\frac{4}{3}\\), the expression \\(4-3x\\geq 0\\), and the formula \\(g(x)\\) returns a real number. Our domain is \\(\\left(-\\infty,\\frac{4}{3}\\right]\\). Footnote 4: The ‘radicand’ is the expression ‘inside’ the radical.\n2. The formula for \\(h(x)\\) is hauntingly close to that of \\(g(x)\\) with one key difference \\(-\\) whereas the expression for \\(g(x)\\) includes an even indexed root (namely a square root), the formula for \\(h(x)\\) involves an odd indexed root (the fifth root). Since odd roots of real numbers (even negative real numbers) are real numbers, there is no restriction on the inputs to \\(h\\). Hence, the domain is \\((-\\infty,\\infty)\\).\n3. In the expression for \\(f\\), there are two denominators. We need to make sure neither of them is \\(0\\). To that end, we set each denominator equal to \\(0\\) and solve. For the 'small' denominator, we get \\(x-3=0\\) or \\(x=3\\). For the 'large' denominator\n\\[1-\\frac{4x}{x-3} = 0\\] \\[1 = \\frac{4x}{x-3}\\] \\[(1)(x-3) = \\left(\\frac{4x}{x-3}\\right).\\] \\[x-3 = 4x\\] \\[-3 = 3x\\] \\[-1 = x\\] So we get two real numbers which make denominators \\(0\\), namely \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). Our domain is all real numbers except \\(-1\\) and \\(3\\): \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup(-1,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. Our goal is to express the function \\(F\\) as \\(F=g\\circ f\\) for functions \\(g\\) and \\(f\\). From Definition 5.1, we know \\(F(x)=g(f(x))\\), and we can think of \\(f(x)\\) as being the 'inside' function and \\(g\\) as being the 'outside' function. Looking at \\(F(x)=|3x-1|\\) from an 'inside versus outside' perspective, we can think of \\(3x-1\\) being inside the absolute value symbols. Taking this cue, we define \\(f(x)=3x-1\\). At this point, we have \\(F(x)=|f(x)|\\). What is the outside function? The function which takes the absolute value of its input, \\(g(x)=|x|\\). Sure enough, \\((g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=|f(x)|=|3x-1|=F(x)\\), so we are done.\n2. We attack deconstructing \\(G\\) from an operational approach. Given an input \\(x\\), the first step is to square \\(x\\), then add \\(1\\), then divide the result into \\(2\\). We will assign each of these steps a function so as to write \\(G\\) as a composite of three functions: \\(f\\), \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). Our first function, \\(f\\), is the function that squares its input, \\(f(x)=x^{2}\\). The next function is the function that adds \\(1\\) to its input, \\(g(x)=x+1\\). Our last function takes its input and divides it into \\(2\\), \\(h(x)=\\frac{2}{x}\\). The claim is that \\(G=h\\circ g\\circ f\\). We find \\[(h\\circ g\\circ f)(x)=h(g(f(x)))=h(g\\left(x^{2}\\right))=h\\left(x^{2}+1\\right) =\\frac{2}{x^{2}+1}=G(x),\\] so we are done.\n3. If we look \\(H(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}\\) with an eye towards building a complicated function from simpler functions, we see the expression \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is a simple piece of the larger function. If we define \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\), we have \\(H(x)=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}\\). If we want to decompose \\(H=g\\circ f\\), then we can glean the formula for \\(g(x)\\) by looking at what is being done to \\(f(x)\\). We take \\(g(x)=\\frac{x+1}{x-1}\\), so \\[(g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=\\frac{f(x)+1}{f(x)-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}+1}{\\sqrt{x}-1}=H(x),\\] as required.\n### 5.1 Function Composition\n\n\n",

We seek to prove that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx+Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}-\\frac{ \\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA.\\]\nIt is sufficient to show that\n\\[\\oint_{C}P\\,dx=\\iint\\limits_{D}-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA\\qquad\\text{ and}\\qquad\\oint_{C}Q\\,dy=\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\,dA,\\]\nwhich we can do if we can compute the double integral in both possible ways, that is, using \\(dA=dy\\,dx\\) and \\(dA=dx\\,dy\\).\nFor the first equation, we start with\n\\[\\iint\\limits_{D}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dA=\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{g_{1}(x)}^{g _{2}(x)}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}\\,dy\\,dx=\\int_{a}^{b}P(x,g_{2}(x))-P(x,g_{1} (x))\\,dx.\\]\nHere we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to \\(y\\): an antiderivative of \\(\\partial P/\\partial y\\) with respect to \\(y\\) is simply \\(P(x,y)\\), and then we substitute \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) for \\(y\\) and subtract.\nNow we need to manipulate \\(\\oint_{C}P\\,dx\\). The boundary of region \\(D\\) consists of 4 parts, given by the equations \\(y=g_{1}(x)\\), \\(x=b\\), \\(y=g_{2}(x)\\), and \\(x=a\\). On the portions \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\), \\(dx=0\\,dt\\), so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{1}(t)\\), \\(a\\leq t\\leq b\\), and \\(x=t\\), \\(y=g_{2}(t)\\), letting \\(t\\) range from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\), since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nand then the outer sum turns into an integral:\n\\[\\lim_{m\\to\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\left(\\int_{c}^{d}f(x_{j},y)\\,dy\\right)\\Delta x =\\int_{a}^{b}\\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)\\,dy\\,dx.\\]\nIn other words, we can compute the integrals in either order, first with respect to \\(x\\) then \\(y\\), or vice versa. Thinking of the loaf of bread, this corresponds to slicing the loaf in a direction perpendicular to the first.\nWe haven't really proved that the value of a double integral is equal to the value of the corresponding two single integrals in either order of integration, but provided the function is reasonably nice, this is true; the result is called **Fubini's Theorem**.\nFigure 15.1: Approximating the volume under a surface with slices. (AP)\n##### Example 15.1.2\nWe compute \\(\\iint\\limits_{R}1+(x-1)^{2}+4y^{2}\\,dA\\), where \\(R=[0,3]\\times[0,2]\\), in two ways.\nFirst,\n\\[\\int_{0}^{3}\\int_{0}^{2}1+(x-1)^{2}+4y^{2}\\,dy\\,dx =\\int_{0}^{3}y+(x-1)^{2}y+\\frac{4}{3}y^{3}\\bigg{|}_{0}^{2}\\,dx\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{3}2+2(x-1)^{2}+\\frac{32}{3}\\,dx\\] \\[=\\left.2x+\\frac{2}{3}(x-1)^{3}+\\frac{32}{3}x\\right|_{0}^{3}\\] \\[=6+\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 8+\\frac{32}{3}\\cdot 3-(0-1\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}+0)\\] \\[=44.\\]\nIn the other order:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{0}^{3}1+(x-1)^{2}+4y^{2}\\,dx\\,dy =\\int_{0}^{2}x+\\frac{(x-1)^{3}}{3}+4y^{2}x\\bigg{|}_{0}^{3}\\,dy\\] \\[=\\int_{0}^{2}3+\\frac{8}{3}+12y^{2}+\\frac{1}{3}\\,dy\\] \\[=\\left.3y+\\frac{8}{3}y+4y^{3}+\\frac{1}{3}y\\right|_{0}^{2}\\] \\[=6+\\frac{16}{3}+32+\\frac{2}{3}\\] \\[=44.\\]\nIn this example there is no particular reason to favor one direction over the other; in some cases, one direction might be much easier than the other, so it's usually worth considering the two different possibilities.\nFrequently we will be interested in a region that is not simply a rectangle. Let's compute the volume under the surface \\(x+2y^{2}\\) above the region described by \\(0\\leq x\\leq 1\\) and \\(0\\leq y\\leq x^{2}\\), shown in figure 15.1.4.\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nThe position of a point for any time t (t>0) s defined by the equations: x=2t, y=ln(t), z = t^2. Find the mean velocity of motion between times t=1 and t=10.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nThere are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If \\(s(t)\\) is the position of the object at time \\(t\\), we know that \\(s^{\\prime}(t)=v(t)\\). Because of our knowledge of derivatives, we know therefore that \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+k\\), and because \\(s(0)=10\\) we easily discover that \\(k=10\\), so \\(s(t)=3t^{2}/2+10\\). For example, at \\(t=1\\) the object is at position \\(3/2+10=11.5\\). This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem. Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult but also more general.\nWe start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at \\(t=0\\) the object is at position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, \\(t=1\\)? We know that the speed of the object at time \\(t=0\\) is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position would still be 10 when \\(t=1\\). In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at \\(t=1\\), but certainly we can do better. Let's look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object\nat each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from \\(t=0.1\\) to \\(t=0.2\\), we suppose that the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at \\(t=0.1\\). In this case the object would travel \\((0.3)(0.1)=0.03\\) centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between \\(t=0.2\\) and \\(t=0.3\\) the object would travel \\((0.6)(0.1)=0.06\\) centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object travels\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nAn object which weighs 6 pounds on the surface of the Earth would weigh 1 pound on the surface of the Moon, but its mass is the same in both places. In the English system of units, 'pounds' (lbs.) is a measure of force (weight), and the corresponding unit of mass is the 'slug'. In the SI system, the unit of force is 'Newtons' (N) and the associated unit of mass is the 'kilogram' (kg). We convert between mass and weight using the formula9\\(w=mg\\). Here, \\(w\\) is the weight of the object, \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. In the English system, \\(g=32\\frac{\\text{fect}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\), and in the SI system, \\(g=9.8\\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{second}^{2}}\\). Hence, on Earth a _mass_ of 1 slug _weighs_ 32 lbs. and a _mass_ of 1 kg _weighs_ 9.8 N.10 Suppose we attach an object with mass \\(m\\) to a spring as depicted below. The weight of the object will stretch the spring. The system is said to be in 'equilibrium' when the weight of the object is perfectly balanced with the restorative force of the spring. How far the spring stretches to reach equilibrium depends on the spring's 'spring constant'. Usually denoted by the letter \\(k\\), the spring constant relates the force \\(F\\) applied to the spring to the amount \\(d\\) the spring stretches in accordance with Hooke's Law11\\(F=kd\\). If the object is released above or below the equilibrium position, or if the object is released with an upward or downward velocity, the object will bounce up and down on the end of the spring until some external force stops it. If we let \\(x(t)\\) denote the object's displacement from the equilibrium position at time \\(t\\), then \\(x(t)=0\\) means the object is at the equilibrium position, \\(x(t)<0\\) means the object is _above_ the equilibrium position, and \\(x(t)>0\\) means the object is _below_ the equilibrium position. The function \\(x(t)\\) is called the 'equation of motion' of the object.12\n\n\n",

What is the maximum of S?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nIf all of the terms \\(a_{n}\\) in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial sums \\(s_{n}\\) is non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series must converge. We know that if the series converges, the terms \\(a_{n}\\) approach zero, but this does not mean that \\(a_{n}\\geq a_{n+1}\\) for every \\(n\\). Many useful and interesting series do have this property, however, and they are among the easiest to understand. Let's look at an example.\n##### Example 11.3.1\nShow that \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}\\) converges.\nThe terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) are positive and decreasing, and since \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}1/x^{2}=0\\), the terms \\(1/n^{2}\\) approach zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number \\(N\\) so that \\(s_{n}\\leq N\\) for every \\(n\\). The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is inherent in figure 11.\nThe figure shows the graph of \\(y=1/x^{2}\\) together with some rectangles that lie completely below the curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are \\(1/1^{2}\\), \\(1/2^{2}\\), \\(1/3^{2}\\), and so on--in other words, exactly the terms of the series. The partial sum \\(s_{n}\\) is simply the sum of the areas of the first \\(n\\) rectangles. Because the rectangles all lie between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding\n### 11.3 The Integral Test\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n\\[(h-R)^{2}+r^{2}=R^{2}.\\]\nWe can solve for \\(h\\) in terms of \\(r\\) or for \\(r\\) in terms of \\(h\\). Either involves taking a square root, but we notice that the volume function contains \\(r^{2}\\), not \\(r\\) by itself, so it is easiest to solve for \\(r^{2}\\) directly: \\(r^{2}=R^{2}-(h-R)^{2}\\). Then we substitute the result into \\(\\pi r^{2}h/3\\):\n\\[V(h) =\\pi(R^{2}-(h-R)^{2})h/3\\] \\[=-\\frac{\\pi}{3}h^{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\pi h^{2}R\\]\nWe want to maximize \\(V(h)\\) when \\(h\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(2R\\). Now we solve \\(0=f^{\\prime}(h)=-\\pi h^{2}+(4/3)\\pi hR\\), getting \\(h=0\\) or \\(h=4R/3\\). We compute \\(V(0)=V(2R)=0\\) and \\(V(4R/3)=(32/81)\\pi R^{3}\\). The maximum is the latter; since the volume of the sphere is \\((4/3)\\pi R^{3}\\), the fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is\n\\[\\frac{(32/81)\\pi R^{3}}{(4/3)\\pi R^{3}}=\\frac{8}{27}\\approx 30\\%.\\]\n**Example 6.1.11**: You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume. Suppose that the top and bottom are made of a material that is \\(N\\) times as expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of the cylinder. Find (in terms of \\(N\\)) the ratio of height to base radius of the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making the containers.\nLet us first choose letters to represent various things: \\(h\\) for the height, \\(r\\) for the base radius, \\(V\\) for the volume of the cylinder, and \\(c\\) for the cost per unit area of the lateral side of the cylinder; \\(V\\) and \\(c\\) are constants, \\(h\\) and \\(r\\) are variables.

It is obvious that \\(a^{5}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and \\(a^{3}=a\\cdot a\\cdot a\\) and that the rest of the example follows; likewise for the second example. But when we consider an exponential function \\(a^{x}\\) we can't be limited to substituting integers for \\(x\\). What does \\(a^{2.5}\\) or \\(a^{-1.3}\\) or \\(a^{\\pi}\\) mean? And is it really true that \\(a^{2.5}a^{-1.3}=a^{2.5-1.3}\\)? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is \"yes.\"\nWe'll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it's not \"obvious\" what \\(2^{x}\\) should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that _is_ obvious, namely, when \\(x\\) is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about \\(2^{x}\\)? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: \\(2^{x}2^{y}=2^{x+y}\\) and \\((2^{x})^{y}=2^{xy}\\).\nAfter the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: \\(2^{0}=1\\). You have presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want \\(2^{a}2^{b}=2^{a+b}\\) to be true about the function \\(2^{x}\\). We need it to be true that \\(2^{0}2^{x}=2^{0+x}=2^{x}\\), and this only works if \\(2^{0}=1\\). The same argument implies that \\(a^{0}=1\\) for any \\(a\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nWe eliminated not only the \\(x\\), but the \\(y\\) as well and we are left with the identity \\(0=0\\). This means that these two different linear equations are, in fact, equivalent. In other words, if an ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) satisfies the equation \\(2x-4y=6\\), it _automatically_ satisfies the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\). One way to describe the solution set to this system is to use the roster method2 and write \\(\\{(x,y)\\,|\\,2x-4y=6\\}\\). While this is correct (and corresponds exactly to what's happening graphically, as we shall see shortly), we take this opportunity to introduce the notion of a **parametric solution to a system**. Our first step is to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for one of the variables, say \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\). For each value of \\(x\\), the formula \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}\\) determines the corresponding \\(y\\)-value of a solution. Since we have no restriction on \\(x\\), it is called a **free variable**. We let \\(x=t\\), a so-called 'parameter', and get \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\). Our set of solutions can then be described as \\(\\big{\\{}\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\mid-\\infty<t<\\infty\\big{\\}}\\).3 For specific values of \\(t\\), we can generate solutions. For example, \\(t=0\\) gives us the solution \\(\\big{(}0,-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\); \\(t=117\\) gives us \\((117,57)\\), and while we can readily check each of these particular solutions satisfy both equations, the question is how do we check our general answer algebraically? Same as always. We claim that for any real number \\(t\\), the pair \\(\\big{(}t,\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\big{)}\\) satisfies both equations. Substituting \\(x=t\\) and \\(y=\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\) into \\(2x-4y=6\\) gives \\(2t-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=6\\). Simplifying, we get \\(2t-2t+6=6\\), which is always true. Similarly, when we make these substitutions in the equation \\(3x-6y=9\\), we get \\(3t-6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)=9\\) which reduces to \\(3t-3t+9=9\\), so it checks out, too. Geometrically, \\(2x-4y=6\\) and \\(3x-6y=9\\) are the same line, which means that they intersect at every point on their graphs. The reader is encouraged to think about how our parametric solution says exactly that.\nFootnote 2: See Section 1.2 for a review of this.\nFootnote 3: Note that we could have just as easily chosen to solve \\(2x-4y=6\\) for \\(x\\) to obtain \\(x=2y+3\\). Letting \\(y\\) be the parameter \\(t\\), we have that for any value of \\(t\\), \\(x=2t+3\\), which gives \\(\\{(2t+3,t)\\,|\\,-\\infty<t<\\infty\\}\\). There is no one correct way to parameterize the solution set, which is why it is always best to check your answer.\n\\[\\begin{array}{rccc}&6x-12y&=&18\\\\ +&(-6x+12y&=&-18)\\\\ \\hline&0&=&0\\end{array}\\]\n\n\n",

Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\), the upper half of the unit circle. What can we say about \\(\\lim_{x\\to 1}f(x)\\)? It is apparent from the graph of this familiar function that as \\(x\\) gets close to 1 from the left, the value of \\(f(x)\\) gets close to zero. It does not even make sense to ask what happens as \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right, since \\(f(x)\\) is not defined there. The definition of the limit, however, demands that \\(f(1+\\Delta x)\\) be close to \\(f(1)\\) whether \\(\\Delta x\\) is positive or negative. Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both) even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this situation, we introduce the concept of **one sided limit**:\n**DEFINITION 2.3.12** **One-sided limit**  Suppose that \\(f(x)\\) is a function. We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<a-x<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). We say that \\(\\lim_{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon>0\\) there is a \\(\\delta>0\\) so that whenever \\(0<x-a<\\delta\\), \\(|f(x)-L|<\\epsilon\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThere are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit that involves \\(\\Delta x\\) but not \\(x\\), which means that whatever \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) is, we know that it is a number, that is, a constant. This means that \\(a^{x}\\) has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.\nWe earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin x/x=1\\); we now have a limit that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that \\(\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to 0}(a^{\\Delta x}-1)/\\Delta x\\) even exists--does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this fact.\nWe can look at some examples. Consider \\((2^{x}-1)/x\\) for some small values of \\(x\\): 1, 0.828427124, 0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when \\(x\\) is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7). Consider next \\((3^{x}-1)/x\\): 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the same values of \\(x\\). It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don't establish a pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of \\(a\\): bigger \\(a\\), bigger limit; smaller \\(a\\), smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere between \\(a=2\\) and \\(a=3\\) the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which this happens is called \\(e\\), so that\n\n\n",

        "llm_user_prompt": "Question:\n----\nIf $x=4*cost(t)$ and $y=8*sin(x)$, what is $y{''}_{xx}$ at t=pi/3?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\nSuppose a mass \\(m\\) is hung on a spring with spring constant \\(k\\). If the spring is compressed or stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Because of friction, the oscillation will be damped: eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by this differential equation: \\(m\\ddot{y}+b\\dot{y}+ky=0\\). Using \\(m=1\\), \\(b=4\\), and \\(k=5\\) we find the motion of the mass. The characteristic polynomial is \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) with roots \\((-4\\pm\\sqrt{16-20})/2=-2\\pm i\\). Thus the general solution is \\(y=A\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+B\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\). Suppose we know that \\(y(0)=1\\) and \\(\\dot{y}(0)=2\\). Then as before we form two simultaneous equations: from \\(y(0)=1\\) we get \\(1=A\\cos(0)e^{0}+B\\sin(0)e^{0}=A\\). For the second we compute\n\\[\\dot{y}=-2Ae^{-2t}\\cos(t)+Ae^{-2t}(-\\sin(t))-2Be^{-2t}\\sin(t)+Be^{-2t}\\cos(t),\\]\nand then\n\\[2=-2Ae^{0}\\cos(0)-Ae^{0}\\sin(0)-2Be^{0}\\sin(0)+Be^{0}\\cos(0)=-2A+B.\\]\nSo we get \\(A=1\\), \\(B=4\\), and \\(y=\\cos(t)e^{-2t}+4\\sin(t)e^{-2t}\\).\nHere is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have \\(y=(\\cos t+4\\sin t)e^{-2t}\\). The expression \\(\\cos t+4\\sin t\\) is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula \\(\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)=\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta)+\\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta)\\) with \\(\\alpha=t\\). Let's rewrite it a bit as\n\\[\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}\\cos t+\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}}\\sin t\\right).\\]\nNote that \\((1/\\sqrt{17})^{2}+(4/\\sqrt{17})^{2}=1\\), which means that there is an angle \\(\\beta\\) with \\(\\cos\\beta=1/\\sqrt{17}\\) and \\(\\sin\\beta=4/\\sqrt{17}\\) (of course, \\(\\beta\\) may not be a \"nice\" angle). Then\n\\[\\cos t+4\\sin t=\\sqrt{17}\\left(\\cos t\\cos\\beta+\\sin\\beta\\sin t\\right)=\\sqrt{17} \\cos(t-\\beta).\\]\nThus, the solution may also be written \\(y=\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\cos(t-\\beta)\\). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted \\(\\beta\\) to the right; the \\(\\sqrt{17}e^{-2t}\\) has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as \\(t\\) increases; see figure 17.5.1. The oscillation is damped very quickly, so in the first graph it is not clear that this is an oscillation. The second graph shows a restricted range for \\(t\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n1. 1. We know \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})\\) is the real number \\(t\\) between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) with \\(\\tan(t)=\\sqrt{3}\\). We find \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), so \\(\\arctan(\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\). 2. The real number \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})\\) lies in the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) with \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\sqrt{3}\\). We get \\(\\operatorname{arccot}(-\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\). 3. We can apply Theorem 10.27 directly and obtain \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=-5\\). However, working it through provides us with yet another opportunity to understand why this is the case. Letting \\(t=\\operatorname{arccot}(-5)\\), we have that \\(t\\) belongs to the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). Hence, \\(\\operatorname{cot}(\\operatorname{arccot}(-5))=\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-5\\). 4. We start simplifying \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)\\) by letting \\(t=\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\). Then \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\) for some \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Since \\(\\tan(t)<0\\), we know, in fact, \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\). One way to proceed is to use The Pythagorean Identity, \\(1+\\operatorname{cot}^{2}(t)=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\), since this relates the reciprocals of \\(\\tan(t)\\) and \\(\\sin(t)\\) and is valid for all \\(t\\) under consideration.4 From \\(\\tan(t)=-\\frac{3}{4}\\), we get \\(\\operatorname{cot}(t)=-\\frac{4}{3}\\). Substituting, we get \\(1+\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2}=\\operatorname{csc}^{2}(t)\\) so that \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=\\pm\\frac{5}{3}\\). Since \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<0\\), we choose \\(\\operatorname{csc}(t)=-\\frac{5}{3}\\), so \\(\\sin(t)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\right)=-\\frac{3}{5}\\). 2. 1. If we let \\(t=\\arctan(x)\\), then \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<t<\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\tan(t)=x\\). We look for a way to express \\(\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)\\) in terms of \\(x\\). Before we get started using identities, we note that \\(\\tan(2t)\\) is undefined when \\(2t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\pi k\\) for integers \\(k\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 tells us we need to exclude values of \\(t\\) where \\(t=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. The only members of this family which lie in \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\) are \\(t=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), which means the values of \\(t\\) under consideration are \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2},-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\cup\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{ 4}\\right)\\cup\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\). Returning to \\(\\arctan(2t)\\), we note the double angle identity \\(\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}\\), is valid for all the values of \\(t\\) under consideration, hence we get \\[\\tan(2\\arctan(x))=\\tan(2t)=\\frac{2\\tan(t)}{1-\\tan^{2}(t)}=\\frac{2x}{1-x^{2}}\\]\n\n\n",

While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5 we proceed analytically. Since \\(-3<0\\), it follows that \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}<\\arctan(-3)<0\\). Multiplying through by \\(2\\) gives \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\). We are now in a position to argue which of the solutions \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi k\\) lie in \\([0,2\\pi)\\).

Next, we turn our attention to \\(k=1\\) and get \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\). Starting with the inequality \\(-\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)<0\\), we add \\(2\\pi\\) and get \\(\\pi<2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi<2\\pi\\). This means \\(x=2\\arctan(-3)+2\\pi\\) lies in \\([0,2\\pi)\\).

Footnote 5: Your instructor will let you know if you should abandon the analytic route at this point and use your calculator. But seriously, what fun would that be?\n6.

This is not required, however.\n**Example 17.1.7**: Solve the differential equation \\(\\dot{y}=2t(25-y)\\). This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, \\(y(t)=25\\) is a solution.

For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=6\\). In light of Definition 11.8, we can find the \\(\\theta\\) we're after by converting the point with rectangular coordinates \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) to polar form \\((r,\\theta)\\) where \\(r=\\|\\vec{v}\\|>0\\). From Section 11.4, we have \\(\\tan(\\theta)=\\frac{-3\\sqrt{3}}{3}=-\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\((3,-3\\sqrt{3})\\) is a point in Quadrant IV, \\(\\theta\\) is a Quadrant IV angle. Hence, we pick \\(\\theta=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\). We may check our answer by verifying \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle=6\\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3 }\\right),\\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\).\n3. 1. Since we are given the component form of \\(\\vec{v}\\), we'll use the formula \\(\\hat{v}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|}\\right)\\vec{v}\\). For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle\\), we have \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\). Hence, \\(\\hat{v}=\\frac{1}{5}\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). 2. We know from our work above that \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=5\\), so to find \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\), we need only find \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\). Since \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle\\), we get \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+(-2)^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|-2\\|\\vec{w}\\|=5-2\\sqrt{5}\\). 3. In the expression \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|\\), notice that the arithmetic on the vectors comes first, then the magnitude. Hence, our first step is to find the component form of the vector \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\). We get \\(\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,4\\right\\rangle-2\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle =\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\vec{v}-2\\vec{w}\\|=\\|\\left\\langle 1,8\\right\\rangle\\|=\\sqrt{1^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{65}\\). 4. To find \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|\\), we first need \\(\\hat{w}\\). Using the formula \\(\\hat{w}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\vec{w}\\) along with \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{5}\\), which we found the in the previous problem, we get \\(\\hat{w}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left\\langle 1,-2\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{5}},-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5},- \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right\\rangle\\). Hence, \\(\\|\\hat{w}\\|=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\right)^{2}+\\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{ 5}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{25}+\\frac{20}{25}}=\\sqrt{1}=1\\).\nThe process exemplified by number 1 in Example 11.8.4 above by which we take information about the magnitude and direction of a vector and find the component form of a vector is called **resolving** a vector into its components. As an application of this process, we revisit Example 11.8.1 below.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 11.9.2**.: Find the angle between the following pairs of vectors.\n1. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle-\\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle\\)\n2. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\)\n3. \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,1\\right\\rangle\\)\n**Solution.** We use the formula \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|}\\right)\\) from Theorem 11.24 in each case below.\n1. We have \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-3\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle- \\sqrt{3},1\\right\\rangle=-3\\sqrt{3}-3\\sqrt{3}=-6\\sqrt{3}\\). Since \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-3\\sqrt{3})^{2}}=\\sqrt{36}=6\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|=\\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{3})^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{4}=2\\), \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-6\\sqrt{3}}{12}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}} {2}\\right)=\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\).\n2. For \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\), we find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle =10-10=0\\). Hence, it doesn't matter what \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\) and \\(\\|\\vec{w}\\|\\) are,2\\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|\\|\\|\\vec{w}\\|} \\right)=\\arccos(0)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Footnote 2: Note that there is no ‘zero product property’ for the dot product since neither \\(\\vec{v}\\) nor \\(\\vec{w}\\) is \\(\\vec{0}\\), yet \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\n3. We find \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 3,-4\\right\\rangle\\cdot\\left\\langle 2,1 \\right\\rangle=6-4=2\\). Also \\(\\|\\vec{v}\\|=\\sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\) and \\(\\vec{w}=\\sqrt{2^{2}+1^{2}}=\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{5\\sqrt{5}}\\right)=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2 5}\\right)\\). Since \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\) isn't the cosine of one of the common angles, we leave our answer as \\(\\theta=\\arccos\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{25}\\right)\\).\nThe vectors \\(\\vec{v}=\\left\\langle 2,2\\right\\rangle\\), and \\(\\vec{w}=\\left\\langle 5,-5\\right\\rangle\\) in Example 11.9.2 are called **orthogonal** and we write \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\), because the angle between them is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians \\(=90^{\\circ}\\). Geometrically, when orthogonal vectors are sketched with the same initial point, the lines containing the vectors are perpendicular.\nWe state the relationship between orthogonal vectors and their dot product in the following theorem.\n**Theorem 11.25**.: **The Dot Product Detects Orthogonality:** Let \\(\\vec{v}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\) be nonzero vectors. Then \\(\\vec{v}\\perp\\vec{w}\\) if and only if \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\).\n\n\n",
