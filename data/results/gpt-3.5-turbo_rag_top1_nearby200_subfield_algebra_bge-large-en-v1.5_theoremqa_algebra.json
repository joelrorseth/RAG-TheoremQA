We can do this by representing one of the coefficients as a decimal. For instance, the same linear system can be represented as\n\\[x+0.5y+\\frac{1}{3}z =1\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2}x+ \\frac{1}{3}y+\\frac{1}{4}z =0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{3}x+ \\frac{1}{4}y+\\frac{1}{5}z =0\\] Most computers do arithmetic using either 32 or 64 bits. To magnify the problem so that we can see it better, we will ask Sage to do arithmetic using only 10 bits as follows.\n``` R=RealNumber RealNumber=RealField(10)\n#ent\nWhat does Sage give for the solution now? Compare this to the exact solution that you found previously.\n2. Some types of linear systems are particularly sensitive to errors resulting from computers' approximate arithmetic. For instance, suppose we are interested in the linear system \\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2\\] Find the solution to this linear system.\nSuppose now that the computer has accumulated some error in one of the entries of this system so that it incorrectly stores the system as\n\\[x+y=2\\] \\[x+1.001y=2.001\\]\nFind the solution to this linear system.\nNotice how a small error in one of the entries in the linear system leads to a solution that has a dramatically large error. Fortunately, this is an issue that has been well studied, and there are techniques that mitigate this type of behavior.\n## Chapter 1 Systems of Equations\n\n\n",

Of course, one of the examples in the activity shows that there are exceptions to this simple rule, as seen in Figure 1.1.2. For instance, two equations in two unknowns may correspond to parallel lines so that the set of equations has no solutions. It may also happen that a set of three equations in two unknowns has a single solution. However, it seems safe to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of solutions will be.\nLet's also consider some examples of equations having three unknowns, which we call \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Just as solutions to linear equations in two unknowns formed straight lines, solutions to linear equations in three unknowns form planes.\nWhen we consider an equation in three unknowns graphically, we need to add a third coordinate axis, as shown in Figure 1.1.3.\nAs shown in Figure 1.1.4, a linear equation in two unknowns, such as \\(y=0\\), is a line while a linear equation in three unknowns, such as \\(z=0\\), is a plane.\n\n\n",

It is useful to identify the symbols appearing in this formula above. The \\(+\\) symbol on the left is addition of scalars, while the \\(+\\) symbol on the right denotes vector addition.

We first discuss this for a lower triangular matrix. Let \\(L\\) be \\(n\\times n\\) and lower triangular with nonzero diagonal elements. We show that the columns are linearly independent, _i.e._, \\(Lx=0\\) is only possible if \\(x=0\\). Expanding the matrix-vector product, we can write \\(Lx=0\\) as\n\\[L_{11}x_{1} = 0\\] \\[L_{21}x_{1}+L_{22}x_{2} = 0\\] \\[L_{31}x_{1}+L_{32}x_{2}+L_{33}x_{3} = 0\\] \\[\\vdots\\] \\[L_{n1}x_{1}+L_{n2}x_{2}+\\cdots+L_{n,n-1}x_{n-1}+L_{nn}x_{n} = 0.\\]\nSince \\(L_{11}\\neq 0\\), the first equation implies \\(x_{1}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=0\\), the second equation reduces to \\(L_{22}x_{2}=0\\). Since \\(L_{22}\\neq 0\\), we conclude that \\(x_{2}=0\\). Using \\(x_{1}=x_{2}=0\\), the third equation now reduces to \\(L_{33}x_{3}=0\\), and since \\(L_{33}\\) is assumed to be nonzero, we have \\(x_{3}=0\\). Continuing this argument, we find that all entries of \\(x\\) are zero, and this shows that the columns of \\(L\\) are linearly independent. It follows that \\(L\\) is invertible.\nA similar argument can be followed to show that an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal elements is invertible. One can also simply note that if \\(R\\) is upper triangular, then \\(L=R^{T}\\) is lower triangular with the same diagonal, and use the formula \\((L^{T})^{-1}=(L^{-1})^{T}\\) for the inverse of the transpose.\nInverse via QR factorization.The QR factorization gives a simple expression for the inverse of an invertible matrix. If \\(A\\) is square and invertible, its columns are linearly independent, so it has a QR factorization \\(A=QR\\). The matrix \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. Hence \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are invertible, and the formula for the inverse product gives\n\n\n",

The two polynomials \\(p(x)q(x)\\) and \\(q(x)p(x)\\) are the same (since multiplication of numbers is commutative), so they have the same coefficients.

Return the numeric without explanation.\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n* _Portfolio return time series._ Suppose that \\(R\\) is a \\(T\\times n\\) asset return matrix, that gives the returns of \\(n\\) assets over \\(T\\) periods. A common trading strategy maintains constant investment weights given by the \\(n\\)-vector \\(w\\) over the \\(T\\) periods. For example, \\(w_{4}=0.15\\) means that \\(15\\%\\) of the total portfolio value is held in asset 4. (Short positions are denoted by negative entries in \\(w\\).) Then \\(Rw\\), which is a \\(T\\)-vector, is the time series of the portfolio returns over the periods \\(1,\\ldots,T\\). As an example, consider a portfolio of the 4 assets in table 6.1, with weights \\(w=(0.4,0.3,-0.2,0.5)\\). The product \\(Rw=(0.00213,-0.00201,0.00241)\\) gives the portfolio returns over the three periods in the example.\n* _Polynomial evaluation at multiple points._ Suppose the entries of the \\(n\\)-vector \\(c\\) are the coefficients of a polynomial \\(p\\) of degree \\(n-1\\) or less: \\[p(t)=c_{1}+c_{2}t+\\cdots+c_{n-1}t^{n-2}+c_{n}t^{n-1}.\\] Let \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\) be \\(m\\) numbers, and define the \\(m\\)-vector \\(y\\) as \\(y_{i}=p(t_{i})\\). Then we have \\(y=Ac\\), where \\(A\\) is the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\[A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}1&t_{1}&\\cdots&t_{1}^{n-2}&t_{1}^{n-1}\\\\ 1&t_{2}&\\cdots&t_{2}^{n-2}&t_{2}^{n-1}\\\\ \\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\ 1&t_{m}&\\cdots&t_{m}^{n-2}&t_{m}^{n-1}\\end{array}\\right].\\] (6.7)\nSo multiplying a vector \\(c\\) by the matrix \\(A\\) is the same as evaluating a polynomial with coefficients \\(c\\) at \\(m\\) points. The matrix \\(A\\) in (6.7) comes up often, and is called a _Vandermonde matrix_ (of degree \\(n-1\\), at the points \\(t_{1},\\ldots,t_{m}\\)), named for the mathematician Alexandre-Theophile Vandermonde.\n\n\n",

We can use feature vector distance to say that one patient case is near another one (at least in terms of their feature vectors).\n\n\n",
