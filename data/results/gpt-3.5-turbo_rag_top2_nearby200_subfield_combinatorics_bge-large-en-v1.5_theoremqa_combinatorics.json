For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nSolution.Both sides count the number of \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\)-strings of length \\(n\\), the right hand side first partitioning them according to positions in the string which are not \\(2\\). (For instance, if \\(6\\) of the positions are not \\(2\\), we must first choose those \\(6\\) positions in \\(C(n,6)\\) ways and then there are \\(2^{6}\\) ways to fill in those six positions by choosing either a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\) for each position.)\n**Example 2.20**.: Explain why, for each non-negative integer \\(n\\),\n\\[\\binom{2n}{n}=\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{2}^{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{ n}{n}^{2}.\\]\nSolution.Both sides count the number of bit strings of length \\(2n\\) with half the bits being \\(0^{\\prime}\\)s, with the right side first partitioning them according to the number of \\(1^{\\prime}\\)s occurring in the first \\(n\\) positions of the string. Note that we are also using the trivial identity \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n### 2.5 The Ubiquitous Nature of Binomial Coefficients\nIn this section, we present several combinatorial problems that can be solved by appeal to binomial coefficients, even though at first glance, they do not appear to have anything to do with sets.\n**Example 2.21**.: The office assistant is distributing supplies. In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\n\n",

In how many ways can we choose 4 balls, if at least 2 are red?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 2.7 Multinomial Coefficients\nLet \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter. By Theorem 3.5.6, the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n+(m-n)-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-n}.\\]\nBy the symmetry of binomial coefficients, \\(\\binom{m-1}{m-n}=\\binom{m-1}{m-1-(m-n)}=\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\).\n**Example 3.5.11**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different different bouquets of 10 balloons are there that contain at least one balloon of each color? In this case, \\(m=10\\) and \\(n=6\\). Hence the number of ways is \\(\\binom{10-1}{6-1}=\\binom{9}{5}\\).\n#### Using multisets to solve distribution problems\nOne application of the multiset counting formula is to count the number of ways to distribute a number of identical objects between a group of people.\n**Corollary 3.5.12**.: _The number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\)._\nProof.: Label the people by the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Suppose \\(S\\) is a multiset of size \\(k\\), whose elements are the letters \\(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\). Then we can distribute the pennies in this way: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq n\\), the number of pennies that person \\(A_{i}\\) receives equals the number of times that \\(A_{i}\\) is included in the multiset. Conversely, given a way of distributing \\(k\\) pennies to the \\(n\\) people, we can create a multiset \\(S\\) of size \\(k\\) from \\(\\{A_{1},\\ldots,A_{n}\\}\\) so that the number of times \\(A_{i}\\) is included in \\(S\\) equals the number of pennies \\(A_{i}\\) received. So the number of ways to distribute \\(k\\) pennies to \\(n\\) people equals the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) from a set of size \\(n\\); this equals \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) by Theorem 3.5.6.\n\n\n",

Similarly, if 36 CSU students driving to Denver divide themselves evenly into 9 cars, then there are 4 people in each car. We end this section with a more challenging example that can be solved with either the division or multiplication principle.\n**Example 2.3.5**.: How many different ways can 10 people be grouped into 5 pairs of two?\nOne approach uses the multiplication principle: Find a predetermined way of ordering the people, such as age). The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.3.7**.: Suppose there are 5 different fruits in your refrigerator: an apple, a banana, an orange, a pear, and a mango. How many ways can you bring one fruit on each day of the work week? Let's call the fruits \\(A,B,O,P\\), and \\(M\\) for short. Then a possible assignment of each of the fruits to a day of the work week is a permutation of \\(\\{A,B,O,P,M\\}\\). Therefore, the number of possibilities is \\(5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=120\\).\nThe problems in this section can be rephrased as counting problems where order matters and repeats are not allowed, in which we arrange all of the objects. In the next section, we consider the more general problem of choosing \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects where order matters but repeats are not allowed. These can be thought of as _ordered subsets_.\n#### Ordered subsets\nThe ice cream adventurers \\(P=\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}\\) decide to wait in line for ice cream yet again. However, to their collective horror, the ice cream shop is closing and can only serve \\(4\\) more customers. How many ordered lines are there that contain \\(4\\) people from the set \\(P\\)? To make such a line, we choose a subset \\(S\\) of \\(P\\) of size \\(4\\) and then order the elements in \\(S\\).\nThis problem is similar to the one seen in Example 3.1.2, where **order matters** and **repeats are not allowed**. More generally, consider the following definition.\n**Definition 3.3.8**.: Suppose \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\). An **ordered subset** of size \\(k\\) from a set \\(A\\) is a string \\(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{k}\\) of distinct elements of \\(A\\).\n\n\n",

Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\n\n\n",

Elements of \\(E\\) are called **edges**. In our course, we will (almost always) use the convention that \\(V=\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) for some positive integer \\(n\\). With this convention, graphs can be described _precisely_ with a text file:\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nLet's begin by coloring the vertices of a square using white and gold. If we fix the position of the square in the plane, there are \\(2^{4}=16\\) different colorings. These colorings are shown in Figure 15.1.\nHowever, if we think of the square as a metal frame with a white bead or a gold bead at each corner and allow the frame to be rotated and flipped over, we realize that many of these colorings are equivalent. For instance, if we flip coloring \\(C_{7}\\) over about the vertical line dividing the square in half, we obtain coloring \\(C_{9}\\). If we rotate coloring \\(C_{2}\\) clockwise by \\(90^{\\circ}\\), we obtain coloring \\(C_{3}\\). In many cases, we want to consider such equivalent colorings as a single coloring. (Recall our motivating example of necklaces made of colored beads. It makes little sense to differentiate between two necklaces if one can be rotated and flipped to become the other.)\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\n\n",

For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\n\n",

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\n\n",

By the addition principle, the number of ways is the sum of the answers for (i) and (ii) and the result follows.\nWe now give combinatorial proofs of the \"sum of squares\" formula from Proposition 4.4.1.\n**Proposition 5.3.4**.: _If \\(n\\) is a natural number, then \\(\\binom{n}{0}^{2}+\\binom{n}{1}^{2}+\\ldots+\\binom{n}{n-1}^{2}+\\binom{n}{n}^{2}= \\binom{2n}{n}\\)._\nWe will prove this in two ways, neither of which is easy.

Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of 80 students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the \"first\" seat on the executive council and her winning the \"fourth\" seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the 80 students without any regard to order. We'll return to this question after introducing our next concept.\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute \\(C(n,k)\\) in general.\n**Proposition 2.9**.: _If \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) are integers with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\), then_\n\n\n",

And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\).\n**Example 10.4.7**.: The number \\(R(3,3)\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) for which any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(3\\)-clique (of one color or the other). We found in Example 10.4.5 and Exercise 1 (below) that the smallest such \\(n\\) is \\(6\\), so \\(R(3,3)=6\\).\n**Example 10.4.8**.: Let's compute \\(R(2,2)\\), which is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) in two colors contains a monochromatic \\(2\\)-clique (of one color or the other). A \\(2\\)-clique is just an edge, so we only need one edge of any color, and so \\(n=2\\) is the smallest possible number that satisfies the condition. Therefore \\(R(2,2)=2\\).\nWe can define Ramsey numbers not only for \\(2\\) colors, but also more generally for \\(k\\) colors.\n**Definition 10.4.9**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(k\\) colors \\(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{k}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n\n\n",

To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone. The restrictions on the passcode are a little peculiar. Specifically, it must contain an even number of \\(0\\)s, at least one \\(1\\), and at most three \\(2\\)s. Bob remarks that although the restrictions are unusual, they don't do much to reduce the number of possible passcodes from the total number of \\(10^{8}\\) eight-digit strings. Carlos isn't convinced that's the case, so he works up an exponential generating function as follows. For the seven digits on\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.8**.: Let's return to the license plate question of Example 2.1. Suppose that Georgia required that the three letters be distinct from each other. Then, instead of having \\(26^{3}=17\\,576\\) ways to fill the last three positions on the license plate, we'd have \\(P(26,3)=26\\times 25\\times 24=15\\,600\\) options, giving a total of \\(140\\,400\\,000\\) license plates.\nAs another example, suppose that repetition of letters were allowed but the three digits in positions two through four must all be distinct from each other (but could repeat the first digit, which must still be nonzero). Then there are still 9 options for the first position and \\(26^{3}\\) options for the letters, but the three remaining digits can be completed in \\(P(10,3)\\) ways. The total number of license plates would then be \\(9\\times P(10,3)\\times 26^{3}\\). If we want to prohibit repetition of the digit in the first position as well, we need a bit more thought. We first have 9 choices for that initial digit. Then, when filling in the next three positions with digits, we need a permutation of length 3 chosen from the remaining 9 digits. Thus, there are \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\) ways to complete the digits portion, giving a total of \\(9\\times P(9,3)\\times 26^{3}\\) license plates.\n\n\n",

For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\).

Four student houses, A, B, C, and D often order pizza. Their patterns of pizza ordering can be modeled as a graph. The graph contains seven vertices -- three vertices for the three pizza parlors, and four vertices for the four student houses. If a house ordered pizza from a particular parlor in the last month, then this support is modeled by an edge in the graph. (Later, we might also choose to weight the edge by the number of pizzas ordered from that parlor over the last month.)\nThis graph has a particular structure: there are no edges between two pizza parlors, since a pizza parlor never orders pizza from another parlor; similarly, there are no edges between two houses, since no house ever orders pizza from another house!\nMany problems in graph theory involve matching two different types of objects, like students with jobs, or pets with owners.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Definition 8.2.8**.: A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) is **bipartite** if \\(V\\) is the disjoint union of two sets \\(L\\) (left) and \\(R\\) (right) and every edge connects a vertex in \\(L\\) with a vertex in \\(R\\).\nIn other words, there are no edges between two vertices in \\(L\\) and no edges between two vertices in \\(R\\).\nFigure 8.6: Bipartite graph with three vertices on the left corresponding to pizza parlors, and four vertices on the right corresponding to houses.

In how many ways can he distribute \\(18\\) identical folders among four office employees: Audrey, Bart, Cecilia and Darren, with the additional restriction that each will receive at least one folder?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nIn the previous section, we considered strings in which repetition of symbols is allowed. For instance, \"01110000\" is a perfectly good bit string of length eight. However, in many applied settings where a string is an appropriate model, a symbol may be used in at most one position.\n**Example 2.5**.: Imagine placing the 26 letters of the English alphabet in a bag and drawing them out one at a time (without returning a letter once it's been drawn) to form a six-character string. We know there are \\(26^{6}\\) strings of length six that can be formed from the English alphabet. However, if we restrict the manner of string formation, not all strings are possible. The string \"yellow\" has six characters, but it uses the letter \"I\" twice and thus cannot be formed by drawing letters from a bag. However, \"jacket\" can be formed in this manner. Starting from a full bag, we note there are 26 choices for the first letter. Once it has been removed, there are 25 letters remaining in the bag. After drawing the second letter, there are 24 letters remaining. Continuing, we note that immediately before the sixth letter is drawn from the bag, there are 21 letters in the bag. Thus, we can form \\(26\\cdot 25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\) six-character strings of English letters by drawing letters from a bag, a little more than half the total number of six-character strings on this alphabet.\n\n\n",

In how many ways can he\nmake such a distribution? At first, this looks a lot like the problem of enumerating integers solutions of equations, except here the lottery tickets are not identical! A ticket bearing the numbers 1, 3, 10, 23, 47, and 50 will almost surely not pay out the same amount as one with the numbers 2, 7, 10, 30, 31, and 48, so who gets which ticket really makes a difference. Hopefully, you have already recognized that the fact that we're dealing with lottery tickets and grandchildren isn't so important here. Rather, the important fact is that we want to distribute distinguishable objects to distinct entities, which calls for counting functions from one set (lottery tickets) to another (grandchildren). In our example, we don't simply want the total number of functions, but instead we want the number of surjections, so that we can ensure that every grandchild gets a ticket.\nFor positive integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), let \\(S(n,m)\\) denote the number of surjections from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Note that \\(S(n,m)=0\\) when \\(n<m\\). In this section, we apply the Inclusion-Exclusion formula to determine a formula for \\(S(n,m)\\). We start by setting \\(X\\) to be the set of all functions from \\([n]\\) to \\([m]\\). Then for each \\(f\\in X\\) and each \\(i=1,2,\\ldots,m\\), we say that \\(f\\) satisfies property \\(P_{i}\\) if \\(i\\) is not in the range of \\(f\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.5.14**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 nonnegative integers have sum equal to 9?

These are called _compositions_ of 9 of length 4.\nSuch a composition encodes a way to distribute \\(k=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people, where the first number on list indicates the number of pennies to person 1, the second is the number of pennies to person 2, and so on.\nTherefore there are \\(\\binom{4}{9}=\\binom{4+9-1}{9}=\\binom{12}{9}=220\\) compositions of 9 of length 4.\n**Corollary 3.5.15**.: _If \\(m\\geq n\\), the number of ways to distribute \\(m\\) identical pennies to \\(n\\) people, so that each person must receive at least one penny, is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\n**Example 3.5.16**.: The number of ways to distribute \\(m=9\\) identical pennies to \\(n=4\\) people so that each person gets at least one is \\(\\binom{9-1}{4-1}=\\binom{8}{3}=56\\).\n**Example 3.5.17**.: How many different ordered lists of 4 positive integers have sum equal to 9?

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line.

There are \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\) ways to choose the first block \\(B_{1}\\).

The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\).

The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n#### Fun with infinite products\n\n\n",

Suppose that instead of electing students to specific offices, the class is to elect an executive council of four students from the pool of 80 students. Each position on the executive council is equal, so there would be no difference between Alice winning the \"first\" seat on the executive council and her winning the \"fourth\" seat. In other words, we just want to pick four of the 80 students without any regard to order. We'll return to this question after introducing our next concept.\nLet \\(X\\) be a finite set and let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(0\\leq k\\leq|X|\\). Then a \\(k\\)-element subset of \\(X\\) is also called a **combination** of size \\(k\\). When \\(|X|=n\\), the number of \\(k\\)-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Numbers of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) are called **binomial coefficients**, and many combinatorists read \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) as \"\\(n\\)**choose**\\(k\\)**.\" When we need an in-line version, the preferred notation is \\(C(n,k)\\) . Also, the quantity \\(C(n,k)\\) is referred to as the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things, taken \\(k\\) at a time.\nBob notes that with this notation, the number of ways a four-member executive council can be elected from the 80 interested students is \\(C(80,4)\\). However, he's puzzled about how to compute the value of \\(C(80,4)\\). Alice points out that it must be less than \\(P(80,4)\\), since each executive council could be turned into \\(4!\\) different slates of officers. Carlos agrees and says that Alice has really hit upon the key idea in finding a formula to compute \\(C(n,k)\\) in general.\n\n\n",

In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\). In particular, if \\(m\\) divides \\(x\\), then \\(x\\equiv 0\\bmod m\\)._\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSo the answer is 8.

Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow let's see how the number of 2-colorings of the square fixed by a permutation can be determined from its cycle structure and associated monomial. If \\(\\pi(i)=j\\), then we know that for \\(\\pi\\) to fix a coloring \\(C\\), vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) must be colored the same in \\(C\\). Thus, the second vertex in a cycle must have the same color as the first. But then the third vertex must have the same color as the second, which is the same color as the first. In fact, all vertices appearing in a cycle of \\(\\pi\\) must have the same color in \\(C\\) if \\(\\pi\\) fixes \\(C\\)! Since we are coloring with the two colors white and gold, we can choose to color the points of each cycle uniformly white or gold. For example, for the permutation \\(v=(12)(34)\\) to fix a coloring of the square, vertices \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) must be colored the same color (\\(2\\) choices) and vertices \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) must be colored the same color (\\(2\\) choices). Thus, there are \\(2\\cdot 2=4\\) colorings fixed by \\(v\\). Since there are two choices for how to uniformly color the elements of a cycle, letting \\(x_{i}=2\\) for all \\(i\\) in the monomial associated with \\(\\pi\\) gives the number of colorings fixed by \\(\\pi\\). In Table 15.10, the \"Fixed colorings\" column gives the number of 2-colorings of the square fixed by each permutation. Before, we obtained this manually by considering the action of \\(D_{8}\\) on the set of all 16 colorings. Now we only need the cycle notation and the monomials that result from it to derive this!\n\n\n",

Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession.

In how many ways can we choose 4 balls, if at least 2 are red?\n\nDocument 1:\n----\n### 2.7 Multinomial Coefficients\nLet \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n\\) elements. Suppose that we have two colors of paint, say red and blue, and we are going to choose a subset of \\(k\\) elements to be painted red with the rest\npainted blue. Then the number of different ways this can be done is just the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Now suppose that we have three different colors, say red, blue, and green. We will choose \\(k_{1}\\) to be colored red, \\(k_{2}\\) to be colored blue, and the remaining \\(k_{3}=n-(k_{1}+k_{2})\\) are to be colored green. We may compute the number of ways to do this by first choosing \\(k_{1}\\) of the \\(n\\) elements to paint red, then from the remaining \\(n-k_{1}\\) elements choosing \\(k_{2}\\) to paint blue, and then painting the remaining \\(k_{3}\\) elements green. It is easy to see that the number of ways to do this is\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1}}\\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!(n-k_{1})!}\\frac{(n-k_{ 1})!}{k_{2}!(n-(k_{1}+k_{2}))!}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!}\\]\nNumbers of this form are called **multinomial coefficients**; they are an obvious generalization of the binomial coefficients. The general notation is:\n\\[\\binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},\\ldots,k_{r}}=\\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!k_{3}!\\ldots k _{r}!}.\\]\nFor example,\n\\[\\binom{8}{3,2,1,2}=\\frac{8!}{3!2!1!2!}=\\frac{40320}{6\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 }=1680.\\]\nNote that there is some \"overkill\" in this notation, since the value of \\(k_{r}\\) is determined by \\(n\\) and the values for \\(k_{1}\\), \\(k_{2}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(k_{r-1}\\). For example, with the ordinary binomial coefficients, we just write \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\) and not \\(\\binom{8}{3,5}\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from an \\(n\\) objects**\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c}  & Order doesn't matter & Order matters \\\\ \\hline Repeats not allowed & \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) & \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) \\\\ Repeats allowed & \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) & \\(n^{k}\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n**Example 3.5.8**.: A store sells 6 colors of balloons. How many different ways can you buy 10 balloons?\n_Answer._ We want to choose a collection of \\(k=10\\) balloons, out of an unlimited supply of \\(n=6\\) colors of balloons, so the answer is \\(\\binom{6}{10}=\\binom{6+10-1}{10}=\\binom{15}{10}=3003\\).\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors.
