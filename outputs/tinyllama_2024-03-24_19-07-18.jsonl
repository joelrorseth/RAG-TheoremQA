The integral is defined as the integral of the function $sin(x)$ from $x=-infty$ to $x=+\u221e$ multiplied by $sin(t/\\pi)$ from $t=-infty$ to $t=+\\infty$, divided by $t^2$.\n\nTo derive the value of the integral, we first need to find the limits of integration. In this case, we have $x=-infty$ to $x=+\u221e$ and $t=-\u221e$ to $t=+\\infty$.\n\nThe integral is given by the formula:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} f(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\u221e} f(x) dx - \\int_{-\\infty}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} f(x) dx$$\n\nHere, $f(x)$ represents the function to integrate, which in this case is $sin(3*t)$ for $t\\in[-\\infty,\\infty]$.\n\nWe then use the fact that the definite integral of a function of one variable is equal to the integral of the function of the opposite variable, so:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(t) dt - \\int_{-\\infty}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} sin(t) dt$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $t$ and $x$ and using the property that $sin(x) = sin(-\\frac{x}{2})$ gives:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\int_{-\u221e}^{+\\frac{1}{2}} sin(t) dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} sin(t) dt$$\n\nAdding the two integrals gives:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\int_{-\u221e}^{+\\frac{1}{2}} sin(t) dt + \\int_{-\\frac{1}{2}}^{-\\infty} sin(t) dt$$\n\nNow, we can substitute $t$ for $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $x$ for $-\\infty$ to get the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\frac{1}{2}} sin(t) dt + \\int_{-\u221e}^{-\\infty} sin(t) dt$$\n\nFinally, we integrate the second term of the series and get:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t)$$\n\nAdding the values of the two integrals gives the final answer:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t)$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $t$ gives:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t)$$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n$$\\int_{-\u221e}^{+\u221e} sin(3*t) dt = \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t) + \\frac{1}{6} sin(t)$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $t^2$ gives:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{6} t^2 + \\frac{1}{6} t^2 + \\frac{1}{6} t^2 + \\frac{1}{6} t^2 = \\frac{1}{6} sin(t)^2 + \\frac{1}{6", "answer_type": "float"}
