By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n2. This is a set partition since the blocks of students are not assigned to different days of the week. There are \\(4!\\) ways to order the \\(4\\) blocks. So we divide the answer to part (1) by \\(4!\\).\nAs a final application, we see what happens if we take a power of a sum of more than two variables. The answer to this question is why the expression \\(\\binom{n}{k_{1},\\ldots,k_{n}}\\) is often called a _multinomial coefficient_.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick). There are therefore \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) possibilities.\n**Remark 3.5.7**.: By the symmetry of binominal coefficients, \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{n-1}\\); this corresponds to choosing the location of the sticks instead.\nUsing Theorem 3.5.6, we can include the formula in the lower left portion of the table and thus complete the table for counting combinations.\n\n\n",

In its pair, \\(A_{1}\\) is called the _outer twin_ and \\(A_{2}\\) is called the _inner twin_ (and similarly for all other twin pairs).\n_Answer._ Suppose for a contradiction this graph were 3-colorable. Without loss of generality let the central vertex be Red. So all 5 inner vertices are Blue or Green. A way of coloring the vertices that agrees with this choice is shown below (but naturally is not a 3-coloring - we will just pretend that it is a valid coloring as an illustration).\nWe will show that, if this coloring is a valid 3-coloring, then we can use it to produce a valid 2-coloring of the outer 5-cycle (but _not_ of the entire graph) as follows: if any outer twin is colored Red, replace Red with the color of its inner twin (Blue or Green). Then in this coloring of the outer cycle with Blue and Green, if an outer twin \\(v\\) is changed from Red to Blue (for example), then both of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins must be Green. Indeed, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been Blue since they are each connected to \\(v\\)'s inner twin which is Blue. Also, neither of \\(v\\)'s adjacent outer twins could have been changed from Red (to any other color) since \\(v\\) was originally Red.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 5.6.12**.: Consider the complete graph \\(K_{6}\\) with 6 vertices (every pair of its vertices is connected by an edge). If you color the edges green and gold, show that there must be either a green triangle or a gold triangle of edges.\n_Answer._ Pick one vertex \\(v\\). It has 5 edges connecting it to the 5 other vertices. Let \\(n=2\\) (for the 2 colors) and let \\(k=2\\). Since \\(5>2\\cdot 2\\), at least 3 of these 5 edges have the same color by Version 2 of the pigeonhole principle. Let's say that color is green; (if not, we can continue with the same reasoning by swapping the colors).\nThese 3 green edges connect \\(v\\) to 3 other vertices, let's call them \\(w,x,y\\). If the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(x\\) is green, then we are done because then \\(v,w,x\\) form a triangle with only green edges. Similarly, if the edge between \\(w\\) and \\(y\\) is green, then we are done and if the edge between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is green then we are done. So the only remaining case is if the three edges between \\(w,x,y\\) are all gold. But then they form a triangle with only gold edges and we are done!\n\n\n",

There are 4 sticks because there are 5 types of fruit to separate. On the other hand, every string of six stones and four sticks describes a bag of fruit. For example, the string\n\\[\\mid\\mid\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\ \\bullet\\]\ndescribes the bag \\(\\{M,O,O,O,O,P\\}\\).\nIn this way, there is a 1-to-1 matching between the bags and the strings. So to count the number of bags of six fruits (with five kinds of fruit), we can count the number of strings of 6 stones and 4 sticks This is equal to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 10 possible positions for the location of the stones. The sticks are then placed in the remaining 4 positions. Thus the answer is \\(\\binom{10}{6}=210\\).\nExample 3.5.5 illustrates several facts. First, the number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements come from a fixed set of size \\(n\\) equals the number of combinations of \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements where order does not matter but repeats are allowed. Recall that we write \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) to express this quantity.\nSecond, this number can be re-expressed as the number of ways to write a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks. Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Notation 3.5.4**.: The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) whose elements are chosen from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}\\) is sometimes written \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). We pronounce this symbol \"\\(n\\) multichoose \\(k\\)\" or \"\\(n\\) choose \\(k\\) with repeats\".\n#### Counting multisets with sticks and stones\nTo count the number of multisets of a certain kind, we use what we call the \"sticks and stones\" method. (In other sources, this is sometimes called the \"stars and bars\" method.) We illustrate this method first with an example.\n**Example 3.5.5**.: Suppose we have an unlimited supply of 5 kinds of fruit: apples, bananas, mangoes, oranges, and pears. Let's write them as A, B, M, O, and P for short. How many ways can we make a bag of 6 fruits?\nSuch a bag can be described as a multiset, for instance, \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\). An alternative way to write this multiset is with a string of sticks (written \\(\\mid\\) ) and stones (written \\(\\bullet\\)). The stones represent fruit and the sticks are dividers between different types of fruit (say in alphabetical order A, B, M, O, P). So the multiset \\(\\{A,B,B,M,M,P\\}\\) is written\n\\[\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\bullet\\bullet\\mid\\mid\\bullet.\\]\nThe first stone indicates that there is one apple, then the next two stones indicates that there are two bananas, and so on. There are no stones between the last two sticks because there are no oranges in the bag.\n\n\n",

It can be stated as follows.\n**Lemma 2.9.3** (Division principle for sets).: _Suppose that \\(\\{B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\}\\) is a set partition of \\(A\\) such that each of the blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{k}\\) has the same cardinality \\(m\\). Then the number of blocks and the size of the blocks satisfy these relationships: \\(|A|/m=k\\), and \\(|A|/k=m\\)._\n**Example 2.9.4**.: How many ways can the letters in the word \"COOL\" be rearranged? If we pretend the two O's are different from each other, calling them \\(O_{1}\\) and \\(O_{2}\\), then there are \\(4!=4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24\\) ways to order them, as discussed in section 1.2.2.

See Section 4.5 for more examples of counting anagrams.\n#### Equivalence relations and modular arithmetic\nEquivalence relations are often used to divide a set into blocks. In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Remark 4.6.6**.: Suppose \\(n=k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{m}\\). Suppose \\(W\\) is a word of length \\(n\\) having \\(k_{i}\\) copies of the letter \\(a_{i}\\), for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), where the letters are taken in alphabetical order. Anagrams of \\(W\\) are directly related to ordered set partitions of the set \\(S=\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\). Here is how that works.\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\n\n\n",

This completes the proof.\nWe have shown that in a group of \\(6\\) people, either some \\(3\\) people know each other or some \\(3\\) people all do not know each other. Interestingly, \\(6\\) people is the minimum number of people required for this fact to be true; it is possible to gather \\(5\\) people in a room such that no three all know each other and no three all do not know each other. (See Exercise 1 below.)\n#### Investigation: Ramsey numbers\nThe example above can be generalized as follows. If we color the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) with two colors, is there guaranteed to be a monochromatic \\(m\\)-clique, for various values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)? And, for a given \\(m\\), what is the smallest value of \\(n\\) for which this is true?\nWe can further generalize this question using the notion of a _Ramsey number_.\n**Definition 10.4.6**.: The **Ramsey number**\\(R(m_{1},m_{2})\\) is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{n}\\) using \\(2\\) colors \\(c_{1}\\) and \\(c_{2}\\) must have one of the following:\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{1}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{1}\\), or\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{2}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{2}\\), or\n* \\(\\cdots\\)\n* A monochromatic \\(m_{k}\\)-clique of color \\(c_{k}\\).\n**Example 10.4.10**.: Let's compute \\(R(3,3,2)\\). This is the smallest number \\(n\\) such that any coloring of the edges of \\(K_{n}\\) using colors red, green, and blue has either a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique.\nFirst note that since there is an edge-colored graph \\(G\\) on \\(5\\) vertices using only red and green colors that does not have a red triangle or a green triangle (see Exercise 1 below), this graph \\(G\\) does not have a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique. So \\(R(3,3,2)>5\\).\nWe can now show that \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\). First, if there is any blue edge in a coloring of \\(K_{6}\\), that is a blue \\(2\\)-clique. On the other hand, if there are no blue edges, then we have a coloring of the edges either red or green, and we know such a coloring either had a red \\(3\\)-clique or green \\(3\\)-clique since \\(R(3,3)=6\\). Therefore any coloring either has a red \\(3\\)-clique, a green \\(3\\)-clique, or a blue \\(2\\)-clique, and so \\(R(3,3,2)=6\\).\n**Ramsey's theorem** says that the Ramsey number \\(R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\) is always finite; that is, there does exist some sufficiently large \\(n\\) for which the statement is true. But what is the minimum such number \\(n=R(m_{1},m_{2},\\ldots,m_{k})\\)? This is in general an unsolved problem, and the study of computing the Ramsey numbers is called _Ramsey theory_, and is one of a large class of optimization problems in graph theory involving coloring graphs.\n\n\n",

The youngest person has 9 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 7 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 5 possible partners, then the youngest remaining has 3 possible partners, and then the last two people will be partners. Hence the total number of ways is\n\\[9\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1=945.\\]\nAnother solution uses the division principle: There are 10! ways to organize the people in a line. We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 2.5.14**.: For instance, all natural numbers are integers and all integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers. We can write this as a _nested sequence of inclusions_\n\\[\\emptyset\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}.\\]\n#### The number of subsets\nWe now address a famous counting question involving sets, which is to count the number of subsets of a set. Here is an example of a concrete application of this problem.\n**Example 2.5.15**.: Four students say that they might go to office hours on Monday. How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\n\n\n",

How many six-character strings can be made using the Hawaiian alphabet?\n**2.** How many \\(2n\\)-digit positive integers can be formed if the digits in odd positions (counting the rightmost digit as position 1) must be odd and the digits in even positions must be even and positive?\n**3.** Matt is designing a website authentication system. He knows passwords are most secure if they contain letters, numbers, and symbols. However, he doesn't quite understand that this additional security is defeated if he specifies in which positions each character type appears. He decides that valid passwords for his system will begin with three letters (uppercase and lowercase both allowed), followed by two digits, followed by one of 10 symbols, followed by two uppercase letters, followed by a digit, followed by one of 10 symbols. How many different passwords are there for his website system? How does this compare to the total number of strings of length 10 made from the alphabet of all uppercase and lowercase English letters, decimal digits, and 10 symbols?\n**4.** How many ternary strings of length \\(2n\\) are there in which the zeroes appear only in odd-numbered positions?\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nBefore proceeding to an additional example, let's take a minute to look at another way to answer the question from the previous example. To count the number of ternary strings of length \\(n\\) with at least one \\(0\\) and at least one \\(1\\), we can count all ternary strings of length \\(n\\) and use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to eliminate the undesirable strings lacking a \\(0\\) and/or a \\(1\\). If a ternary string lacks a \\(0\\), we're counting all strings made up of \\(1\\)s and \\(2\\)s, so there are \\(2^{n}\\) strings. Similarly for lacking a \\(1\\). However, if we subtract \\(2\\cdot 2^{n}\\), then we've subtracted the strings that lack both a \\(0\\)_and_ a \\(1\\) twice. A ternary string that has no \\(0\\)s and no \\(1\\)s consists only of \\(2\\)s. There is a single ternary string of length \\(n\\) satisfying this criterion. Thus, we obtain \\(3^{n}-2\\cdot 2^{n}+1\\) in another way.\n**Example 8.20**.: Alice needs to set an eight-digit passcode for her mobile phone.

So there are 10 choices for the first odd number, 9 choices for the second, 8 choices for the third, and 7 choices for the fourth. The last two numbers can be odd or even and there are 16 numbers left. So that gives 16 choices for the fifth and 15 choices for the sixth.

So first we need to choose four numbers out of the 10 odd numbers, then we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 16 numbers. So the answer is\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\nProof of Theorem 2.5.16.: Let's label the elements of \\(S\\) as \\(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\), so that \\(S=\\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\\ldots,a_{n}\\}\\).

Four student houses, A, B, C, and D often order pizza. Their patterns of pizza ordering can be modeled as a graph. The graph contains seven vertices -- three vertices for the three pizza parlors, and four vertices for the four student houses. If a house ordered pizza from a particular parlor in the last month, then this support is modeled by an edge in the graph. (Later, we might also choose to weight the edge by the number of pizzas ordered from that parlor over the last month.)\nThis graph has a particular structure: there are no edges between two pizza parlors, since a pizza parlor never orders pizza from another parlor; similarly, there are no edges between two houses, since no house ever orders pizza from another house!\nMany problems in graph theory involve matching two different types of objects, like students with jobs, or pets with owners.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Proposition 2.10**.: _For all integers \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) with \\(0\\leq k\\leq n\\),_\n\\[\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}.\\]\n**Example 2.11**.: A Southern restaurant lists 21 items in the \"vegetable\" category of its menu.

Third, this number equals the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) locations for stones out of \\(k+(n-1)\\) locations for sticks and stones. We state this more formally in the next theorem.\n**Theorem 3.5.6**.: _The number of multisets of size \\(k\\) in which every element is chosen from an alphabet of size \\(n\\) is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\). More generally, \\(\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects, where order does not matter and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: We can write the multiset as a string of \\(k\\) stones and \\(n-1\\) sticks, where the \\(n-1\\) sticks separate the \\(n\\) types of possible elements of the alphabet in some chosen \"alphabetical order\". Then there are \\(n-1+k=n+k-1\\) total sticks and stones in the string. We count the number of ways to choose which \\(k\\) of the positions in the string contain a stone (as opposed to a stick).

An infinite sequence can also be thought of as a function that assigns a number (or symbol) to every positive integer.\n#### Counting where order matters and repeats are allowed\nThe type of counting seen in Example 3.1.3, where **order matters** and **repeats are allowed**, can be restated in terms of counting sequences. Indeed, if we choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects in order, with repeats allowed, we can write them as a sequence from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols.\nWe can count such sequences as follows.\n**Theorem 3.2.4**.: _The number of sequences of length \\(k\\) composed from an alphabet with \\(n\\) symbols is \\(n^{k}\\). More generally, there are \\(n^{k}\\) combinations of \\(k\\) objects chosen from \\(n\\) objects, where order matters and repeats are allowed._\nProof.: There are \\(n\\) ways to choose the first symbol in the sequence, then \\(n\\) ways to choose the second, and so on up to the \\(k\\)th. Therefore there are \\(n\\cdot n\\cdot n\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot n=n^{k}\\) possibilities.\nUsing Theorem 3.2.4, we can complete the general formula for one entry of the table.\n**Number of ways to choose \\(k\\) objects from \\(n\\) objects**\n\n\n",

How many different groups might show up in office hours?\nThe above problem can be modeled by counting the possible subsets of the set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) of four students.\nTo answer this question in general, we need to count the number of subsets in a set \\(A\\) of size \\(n\\). Before we dive into the theorem, let's look at a few cases:\n* \\(n=1\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{a\\}\\), so a set with 1 element has 2 subsets.\n* \\(n=2\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), so a set with 2 element has 4 subsets.\n* \\(n=3\\): The subsets of \\(A=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) are \\(\\emptyset\\), \\(\\{a\\}\\), \\(\\{b\\}\\), \\(\\{c\\}\\), \\(\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\{a,c\\}\\), \\(\\{b,c\\}\\), and \\(\\{a,b,c\\}\\), so a set with 3 element has 8 subsets.\nIn each case, our answer was a power of 2, with \\(2^{1}=2\\), \\(2^{2}=4\\), and \\(2^{3}=8\\). For a set \\(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\) with four elements, like in Example 2.5.15, we might guess that the number of subsets is \\(2^{4}=16\\).\nThe following theorem proves that this pattern holds for any set of finite size.\n**Theorem 2.5.16**.: _If \\(S\\) is a set with \\(n\\) elements, then \\(S\\) has \\(2^{n}\\) subsets._\n\nDocument 2:\n----\n**Example 3.5.9**.: When Student C orders the large sundae, there are \\(k=15\\) scoops and \\(n=10\\) flavors, so the number of possibilities is \\(\\binom{10+15-1}{15}=\\binom{24}{15}=1,307,504\\) different sundaees they can order -- they will have to order about 3,593 sundaes a day to make sure they try every one in a year!\n#### A variation: choosing at least one of each type\nIn Example 3.5.9, that is far too many sundaes for the students to eat every day! What if instead they wanted to order their sundae so that there was at least one scoop of each flavor?\nThe first 10 scoops are determined (one of each flavor). So student \\(c\\) now needs to choose \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) more scoops from among the \\(n^{\\prime}=10\\) flavors. So the number of choices is \\(\\binom{14}{5}=2,002\\) sundaes to order - about 6 sundaes a day!\n**Corollary 3.5.10**.: _Let \\(m\\geq n\\). The number of ways to choose \\(m\\) elements from an \\(n\\)-element set where order does not matter, repeats are allowed, and at least one of each of the \\(n\\) elements is chosen is \\(\\binom{m-1}{n-1}\\)._\nProof.: We start by picking one of each element. Then we must pick \\(m-n\\) additional elements from the \\(n\\) possibilities, where repeats are allowed and order does not matter.

Indeed, below we show how to turn this map into a planar graph, and how a valid coloring of this map translates into a vertex coloring of the corresponding planar graph. To form the graph, add a vertex for each region, and add an edge between two vertices if the corresponding regions are adjacent. A valid coloring of the map, with no adjacent regions of the same color, corresponds to a vertex coloring of the graph, meaning that no adjacent vertices have the same color.\nLet us explain why this map requires at least 4 colors, in order for adjacent regions to have different colors. Suppose for a contradiction 3 colors sufficed. Without loss of generality, color the region 'N' red, color the region 'C' blue, and color the region 'O' green. Then necessarily the region 'I' must be blue, as it is already adjacent to green and red regions, and we have only three colors at our disposal.

We pair the first and second people, the third and fourth people, etc. There are 5! ways to rearrange the ordering of\nthe pairs, which does not affect who is paired with whom. Also, there are 2 ways to switch the order of the people in each of the five pairs, which also does not affect who is paired with whom. So the total number of pairs is\n\\[\\frac{10!}{5!\\cdot 2^{5}}=945.\\]\n### Exercises\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nGiven an anagram of \\(W\\), we can make an ordered block partition as follows: for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), find the positions of the \\(i\\)th letter and put those numbers in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, consider the anagram IMSSSPIIPSI (of MISSISSIPPI): the \\(\\Gamma\\)s are in positions 1,7,8, and 11, the M is in position 2; the P's are in positions 5 and 9; and the S's are in positions 3,4,5, and 10. From this, we make the ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{1,7,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{2\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{5,9\\}\\), and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,5,10\\}\\). Conversely, given an ordered set partition with blocks \\(B_{i}\\) of size \\(k_{i}\\) for \\(1\\leq i\\leq m\\), we can make an anagram of the word \\(W\\), by putting the \\(i\\)th letter in the positions numbered by the elements in the block \\(B_{i}\\). For example, the blocks \\(B_{1}=\\{2,5,8,11\\}\\), \\(B_{2}=\\{1\\}\\), \\(B_{3}=\\{9,10\\}\\) and \\(B_{4}=\\{3,4,6,7\\}\\) gives the original spelling of MISSISSIPPI.\nProof.: (Proof of Theorem 4.5.7) By Remark 4.6.6, the number of anagrams of \\(W\\) is the same as the number of ordered set partitions into blocks of sizes \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{m}\\). By Theorem 4.6.3, we obtain the desired formula for the number of these.\nThe next example illustrates the difference between an ordered set partition and a set partition.\n**Example 4.6.7**.: Suppose there are 12 students in a class.\n1. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3 who will be assigned to present homework solutions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday?\n2. How many ways can they be separated into 4 groups of 3?\n_Answer._:\n1. Each assignment is an ordered set partition of the 12 students into blocks \\(B_{1},\\ldots,B_{4}\\) of size three (speaking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday respectively). So the answer is \\[\\binom{12}{3,3,3,3}=\\frac{12!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 3!}.\\]\n\n\n",

In fact, every equivalence relation on a set makes a set partition.\n**Definition 2.9.5**.: An _equivalence relation_ on a set \\(S\\) is a way of identifying elements \\(x\\sim y\\) with the three following rules:\n1. (reflexive) \\(x\\sim x\\);\n2. (symmetric) if \\(x\\sim y\\), then \\(y\\sim x\\);\n3. (transitive) if \\(x\\sim y\\) and \\(y\\sim z\\), then \\(x\\sim z\\).\n**Example 2.9.6**.: How many ways can students \\(A,B,C,D\\) be seated at a rotating round table? There are \\(24=4!\\) ways for the students to sit down at the table. We say that two seating arrangements are equivalent if they look the same after a rotation. For example,\n\\[ABCD\\sim DABC\\sim CDAB\\sim BCDA.\\]\nEach seating arrangement is equivalent to three others. So we can divide the set of seating arrangements into blocks, each of which has size 4. By the division principle, there are 6 blocks.\nOne important equivalence relation is called congruence modulo \\(m\\).\n**Definition 2.9.7**.: Let \\(m\\) be a positive integer. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be integers. We say that \\(x\\) is **congruent to \\(y\\) modulo \\(m\\)** when \\(m\\) divides \\(y-x\\). This is written \\(x\\equiv y\\bmod m\\).\n**Lemma 2.9.8**.: _If \\(r\\) is the remainder when \\(x\\) is divided by \\(m\\), then \\(x\\equiv r\\bmod m\\).

One very famous such object is called a _partition_. The following video explores this topic.\nClick on the icon at left or the link below for this section's video.\nPartitions and their generating functions\nWe first recall some of the notions defined in the video.\n**Definition 7.8.1**.: A **partition** of a positive integer \\(n\\) is a way of writing \\(n\\) as a sum of other positive integers, where the order of the summands doesn't matter. The summands are called the **parts** of the partition, and we write \\(\\lambda=(\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2},\\ldots,\\lambda_{k})\\) for the partition given by the decomposition \\(n=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}+\\cdots+\\lambda_{k}\\), where we order the parts in weakly decreasing order: \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{k}\\).\n**Example 7.8.2**.: Since \\(5=2+1+2\\), the tuple \\((2,2,1)\\) is a partition of \\(5\\). (Note that we write the parts in weakly decreasing order as a canonical choice.) The seven partitions of \\(5\\) are:\n\\[(5),\\qquad\\quad(4,1),\\qquad\\quad(3,2),\\qquad\\quad(3,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(2,2,1), \\qquad\\quad(2,1,1,1),\\qquad\\quad(1,1,1,1,1).\\]\n**Definition 7.8.3**.: We write \\(p(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\), and \\(q(n)\\) for the number of partitions of \\(n\\) whose parts are all distinct.\n**Example 7.8.4**.: As seen in the above example, we have \\(p(5)=7\\) and \\(q(5)=3\\).\n**Example 7.8.5**.: Show that \\(p(6)=11\\) and \\(q(6)=4\\).\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nNow that we know the cycle structure of the permutations in \\(S_{4}^{(2)}\\), the only task remaining before we can find its cycle index of is to determine how many permutations have each of the possible cycle structures. For this, we again refer back to permutations of the symmetric group \\(S_{4}\\). A permutation consisting of a single 4-cycle begins with 1 and then has 2, 3, and 4 in any of the \\(3!=6\\) possible orders, so there are 6 such permutations. For permutations consisting of a 1-cycle and a 3-cycle, there are 4 ways to choose the element for the 1-cycle and then 2 ways to arrange the other three as a 3-cycle. (Remember the smallest of them must be placed first, so there are then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two.) Thus, there are 8 such permutations. For a permutation consisting of two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose the two elements for the 2-cycle. Thus, there are 6 such permutations. For a permutation to\nconsist of two 2-cycles, there are \\(C(4,2)=6\\) ways to choose two elements for the first 2-cycle. The other two are then put in the second 2-cycle. However, this counts each permutation twice, once for when the first 2-cycle is the chosen pair and once for when it is the \"other two.\" Thus, there are 3 permutations consisting of two 2-cycles. Finally, only \\(\\iota\\) consists of four 1-cycles.\n\n\n",

Assuming the first player marks her squares with X and the second marks his with O, then at each stage of the game there are either the same number of X's and O's or one more X than there are O's. Use this fact and \\(t(X,O)\\) to determine the number of nonequivalent tic-tac-toe boards that can actually be obtained in playing a game, assuming the players continue until the board is full, regardless of whether one of them has won the game.\nFigure 15.16: Numbered squares of a tic-tac-toe board\n**12.** Suppose you are painting the faces of a cube and you have white, gold, and blue paint available. Two painted cubes are equivalent if you can rotate one of them so that all corresponding faces are painted the same color. Determine the number of nonequivalent ways you can paint the faces of the cube as well as the number having two faces of each color.\n**Hint.** It may be helpful to label the faces as \\(U\\) (\"up\"), \\(D\\) (\"down\"), \\(F\\) (\"front\"), \\(B\\) (\"back\"), \\(L\\) (\"left\"), and \\(R\\) (\"right\") instead of using integers. Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\n\n",

Working with a three-dimensional model of a cube will also aid in identifying the permutations you require.\n\nDocument 2:\n----\nTo systematically determine how many of the colorings shown in Figure 15.1 are not equivalent, we must think about the transformations we can apply to the square and what each does to the colorings. Before examining the transformations' effects on the colorings, let's take a moment to see how they rearrange the vertices. To do this, we consider the upper-left vertex to be 1, the upper-right vertex to be 2, the lower-right vertex to be 3, and the lower-left vertex to be 4. We denote the clockwise rotation by \\(90^{\\circ}\\) by \\(r_{1}\\) and see that \\(r_{1}\\) sends the vertex in position 1 to position 2, the vertex in position 2 to position 3, the vertex in position 3 to position 4, and the vertex in position 4 to position 1. For brevity, we will write \\(r_{1}(1)=2\\), \\(r_{1}(2)=3\\), etc. We can also rotate the square clockwise by \\(180^{\\circ}\\) and denote that rotation by \\(r_{2}\\). In this case, we find that \\(r_{2}(1)=3\\), \\(r_{2}(2)=4\\), \\(r_{2}(3)=1\\), and \\(r_{2}(4)=2\\). Notice that we can achieve the transformation \\(r_{2}\\) by doing \\(r_{1}\\) twice in succession. Furthermore, the clockwise rotation by \\(270^{\\circ}\\), \\(r_{3}\\), can be achieved by doing \\(r_{1}\\) three times in succession. (Counterclockwise rotations can be avoided by noting that they have the same effect as a clockwise rotation, although\n\n\n",
