They must all fit within the region, and they must cover it completely without overlapping. What is the minimum number of tiles required to tile the region?",

Start by trying to tile the region with one type of tile, then try the other type if the first one doesn't work. Keep experimenting with different arrangements until the entire region is covered without any gaps or overlaps. Count the number of tiles used in each arrangement to determine the minimum number required.\n3. Try tiling the region with the first type of tile by starting from one corner and working your way across row by row. Count the number of tiles used and see if it covers the entire region without any gaps.\n\nWrite the continuation steps line by line.",
